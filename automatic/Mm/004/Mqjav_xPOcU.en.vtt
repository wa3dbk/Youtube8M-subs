00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 so worth something welcome zones 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.620
 other video since I do not murder today 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.130
 I've found you 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.260
 can 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.700
 I present you my top 5 today 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.530
 minecraft server 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.580
 i hope it's dangerous and after that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.580
 impression of the going 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.730
 My fifth place is a rather unknown one 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.220
 server he is plain text and does not own 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.610
 just a few mini games like hunger games 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.760
 quick or similar but one more 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.739
 Survival Pipi World is going in this world 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.010
 it's about your hidden base too 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.390
 Build by upgrading against others 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.360
 to fight players 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.379
 Although Europe is ace crude mine 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.159
 was found 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.110
 My fourth place is the best known 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.260
 This year only has mini games like 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.780
 survival games want in the champions 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.210
 league and much more helper stable 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.659
 mini game server where it almost never lay 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.180
 wonderful lobbies and funny game modes 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.850
 however, there is a big minus point 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.729
 the community one can almost say 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.890
 that's really antisocial to 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.350
 For example, youtuber takes one 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.020
 own servers have youtuber wrestle away 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.090
 or even warned 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.340
 My third place is the cottbuser 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.530
 Also this server is on mini games 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.469
 designed and was genuine because of its 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.960
 Ingenious game modes mean and smash them 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.749
 The match is a great smash 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.060
 brothers clown in minecraft what really 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.939
 was implemented very well and mine 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.920
 and day signo what also implemented brilliantly 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.869
 has been 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.179
 my second place is the server my 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.310
 plex this server surely know some 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.740
 male blacks is also a bit 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.549
 However, he has a lot of game servers 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 innovative new game modes such as eg super 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.249
 smash pug great escape from affing and 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.280
 much more 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.799
 in addition, this server has a very 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.200
 good party system with which you 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.480
 easier to play with your friends 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.970
 I had to think for a long time 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.000
 which I have pinned on the top 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.860
 but finally put me for 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.010
 the gong hd server decided 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.430
 this summer is from the well-known 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.680
 youtube.com hd is thought of 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.409
 the server is also a mini-game server 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.530
 however , he has a special mini-game 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.900
 which is really awesome and this one 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.629
 server distinguishes 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.180
 ender games in ender game do you play with? 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.430
 one of your selected kit in one 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.250
 normally generated map a kind of survival 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.530
 games okay it's not quite because 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.810
 games will'll putted back and forth 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.090
 and had to find boxes too 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.680
 can teleport if they end 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.319
 Do not know games you have to open it 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.420
 every once so gamble that were 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.890
