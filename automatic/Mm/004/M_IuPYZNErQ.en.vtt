00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
level more comp plan I think that's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
level more comp plan I think that's
significant<00:01:36.119> because<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.659> times<00:01:36.960> in

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
significant because a lot of times in

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
significant because a lot of times in
some<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:37.799> plans<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.670> an<00:01:38.790> awful
