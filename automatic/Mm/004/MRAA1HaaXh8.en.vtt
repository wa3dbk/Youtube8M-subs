00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.540
 purple break eggs I'll be you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.219
 named point 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.080
 today I'm going to introduce you to my 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.219
 classes on call of duty kid so 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.470
 it's the boxes with which I have 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.850
 returned small clips so here's so 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.600
 we could already have a lot of sales h at 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.789
 level 60 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 I will not say no because I 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.269
 just do not want I do not have this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.130
 even want and so I want to introduce my 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.369
 classes so first of all know that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.260
 greet the one I use the most good 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.820
 it's just my favorite sniper on game 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.989
 but I find that all and of all 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.610
 areas of the game are really rather 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.260
 well there are just the links I 'm leaving 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.510
 have hung I have parents a lot with 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 but I'm going to try so we 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.770
 start early I was with my classes 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.350
 so today I have class number 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.710
 one is cove cash with aces and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.750
 to the jets with the basic viewfinder end the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.090
 the little basic zoom viewer of bachelot 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 ball and honestly I love them sniper 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 to be silent 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.829
 he has a lot of bullets and he is precise 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 with will lodge it's really great 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.080
 snipe so the trumps I use good 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.250
 hiding I suppose zhejiang there so I 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 be happy with passwords going on 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 2 go maybe marathon I think no no 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.369
 no marathon good just we can reload 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.229
 on the other hand we can recharge in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.600
 sprinting then I use good 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 trigger 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 then I use recon I do not have everything 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.570
 you say 103 m but it allows you to see 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 when enemies have explosives 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.460
 when you flash the example 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.930
 then added receiving which allows me 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.340
 not to take damage as soon as I 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.390
 do a chuis quite simply so 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 it's quite practical and I use the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.960
 concept to all ah good the number 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 will come back in the meantime that's the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.439
 assets that I use on all my 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 classes almost so the crises money 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.939
 people do not use particularly 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.290
 does not really use them so I 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.640
 keep this basic 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.670
 then a class that I never 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.390
 used that yeah I'm not just not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.310
 want to try 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.640
 but in any case the strengths I need 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.750
 see if the same I use a flash 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.399
 until always practical enough I 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.140
 do not use often but good 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.459
 then the ovehckin class zoom 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.349
 adjustable I did not use much 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.780
 either but I find that she is 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.540
 alley top still go go go 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.939
 still good spot still even 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.769
 all except that there stray strikes 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.230
 package I used a different trick 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.299
 I used support if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.310
 then my class is 115 with this 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.450
 class in this 7pl pack this game it was 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.970
 almost with this class there was 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.230
 just not the thermal viewfinder when I 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.730
 did my first clip on call of duty 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.019
 kid canvas 115 is besides I was 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.329
 the first to make a clip where they are 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.549
 15 on ghost so good it's still a 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.780
 foot a little more thing then my 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.220
 class at ufr as I say it is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.310
 my favorite class this one so 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.500
 I use it and serve the caustic camo 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.680
 I have been using for quite 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 time 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.650
 So I've returned with clip 1/4 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.120
 day so I'm doing pretty well 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.120
 with this class so I use to 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.150
 load large adjustable zoom cape and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.659
 chrome making it possible to have more 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.310
 damage on bullet safety and but the only 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.959
 default is that it gives more kiko 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.879
 sniper but that's not too bad there 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.169
 You just get used to it then was 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.090
 all I use of you a little different 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.220
 recapture will use diop that me 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.750
 allow me to save my life faster 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.160
 after sprinting so first a 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.440
 weapon more ready to fight more 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.519
 quickly years use bangash to be 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 recon toughness I took as they say 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.810
 that's good it was holding his emblem is a 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.190
 trick to have three sets accessories 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.260
 will be sniper so it's also pretty good 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.049
 sense and my final class is that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.159
 the one with a thermal viewfinder so 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.650
 I do not use too much because rather a 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.909
 fan of adjustable zooms so I should 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.840
 try besides the bts in image 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.209
 stable but I have not yet had 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.739
 the opportunity to do it if not 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.370
 asset level more or less the same 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.739
 thing uses the thermal and the home the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.329
 charge large capes with the expensive 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.889
 launched we never know it can always 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.500
 pass a cross maps is always 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.810
 nice and have them all I think 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.639
 I use the same here so are the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.409
 ranges do not hesitate to leave a small 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.090
 I like a comment it's great 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.190
 I already have five clips on call of 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.049
 duty cause so hope I hope I can 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.919
 go out a montage Saturday because I 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.310
 would not be there this weekend would be to 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.349
 London 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.320
 but I hope to come out you 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.930
 small assembly with standard not found 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.310
 no more but good 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.290
 do not hesitate to leave a reich 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.830
 add this fabrice video if you have 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.970
 want to see her again to see my classes 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.030
 it was people going low and all the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.030
 world
