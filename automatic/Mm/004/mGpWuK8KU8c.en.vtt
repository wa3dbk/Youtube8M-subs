from this Nintendo Direct we got new

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.920 
from this Nintendo Direct we got new
footage<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> game<00:02:39.330> including<00:02:39.750> what<00:02:39.840> I'm

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
footage the game including what I'm

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.330

guessing<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> game's<00:02:40.650> opening<00:02:40.890> few

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.100 
guessing is the game's opening few
moments<00:02:41.820> although<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.660> particular

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
moments although this particular

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.840 
moments although this particular
internal<00:02:43.380> direct<00:02:43.590> was<00:02:43.770> only<00:02:44.040> broadcasted<00:02:44.760> in

internal direct was only broadcasted in

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.380 
internal direct was only broadcasted in

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
Japanese so it's kind of hard to tell we
