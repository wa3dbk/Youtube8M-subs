I mean I understand the necessity and it

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.150 
I mean I understand the necessity and it
is<00:02:46.579> more<00:02:46.819> efficient<00:02:47.299> I<00:02:47.390> guess<00:02:47.660> but<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.290> mean<00:02:49.069> I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
is more efficient I guess but I mean I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.800 
is more efficient I guess but I mean I
