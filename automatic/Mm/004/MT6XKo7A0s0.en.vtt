00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello, I'm Anna Oskina and welcome 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.099
 to my channel 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.349
 in this master class I will show you how 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.730
 make beautiful turquoise earrings in 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 mixed technique stay with me in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 I will use four colors in my work 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 polymer clay 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.920
 two of which I roll out with effects 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 three colors about 3 millimeters thick 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.380
 white size twice 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.660
 more than color therefore white divide 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 in half and fold all the colors in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.460
 alternating order roll out all 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.620
 a pile of rolling pin so that the layers are good 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 stuck together and to themselves 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.379
 pile has become longer received 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
 I divide a long layer in half and fold 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.739
 then again I divide in half and fold it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.239
 I get a striped block this block 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.969
 I lay on ceramic tiles 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.340
 I can press it well 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.220
 rolling pin on the back of the blade 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.439
 i'm driving up to the tile all these 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.470
 strips this whole unit this technique 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.780
 Mokume Ghana cuts I did the reverse 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 the side of the knife the blunt side of the block 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.360
 little disperse in different directions 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.729
 when i make these cuts so 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 I need to trim this block 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.340
 trim it in hand and with 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340
 rolling pins 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.950
 now I take sharp blades and cut them off 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.390
 the top layer of this block in the cut I see 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 multi-colored stripes 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.460
 waves and necessary because of this block 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.650
 make several such block slices 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.420
 placed on ceramic tiles just 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.550
 because polymer clay is good 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.400
 sticks to the tile and will not 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.740
 slide when cutting exactly the same 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.500
 the effect is obtained when using 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.650
 glass surface now i take 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.560
 extruder put a small amount of 4 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.290
 colors and squeeze with a nozzle with small 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.020
 dots me get a lot 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.250
 long threads these threads will be further 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.380
 used in work 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.050
 Now I want to make a central 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.120
 a pebble i take one of the technology slices 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.830
 can we go'n and twist it 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.160
 and add turquoise threads and then 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.110
 I twist the resulting sausage 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.330
 I twist very tightly 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.310
 first form a pancake then 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.220
 rolling out with a rolling pin and I get 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.290
 I cover the surface with beautiful stripes 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.230
 this surface is conventional cling film 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.510
 and cut a tipple straight 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.360
 through the film thanks to the film I have 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.760
 it turns out beautiful rounded edge tidy up 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.270
 all the excess I get 2 striped 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.270
 pebble 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.720
 from the remnants of this striped formation I 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.040
 I make two balls kata 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.040
 they are just in the palms 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.500
 and wooden toothpicks make holes 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.989
 when you make a hole a little bit 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.110
 twist a wooden toothpick 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.700
 headquarters bead not laughed 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.700
 I roll a layer of turquoise color and 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:31.959
 mold I outline approximate boundaries 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:34.599
 products then take one of the layers I can 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.780
 we ghana and cut it into not even strips 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.420
 on the basis for the future earrings spread 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.510
 alternately parts cut off 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.180
 from poppy machines and ghana and extruder on 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.269
 the internet is formed as a result of striped 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.269
 pattern 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.640
 the mold is the same droplet which we 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.769
 cut out to me i cut a hole in 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.530
 basis for earrings all parts for 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.780
 earrings ready to collect them left for 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.180
 order to collect these parts is necessary 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.030
 basis i take all the leftovers that i have 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.550
 left after this job crushing them 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.190
 cut into small pieces together 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.350
 mix and roll on the post machine 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.730
 then take the textured sheet which I 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.710
 made from salt 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.080
 link to this master class you will see 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.030
 right below the video and cling to this 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.360
 variegated surface to make 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.510
 textured surface is now all 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.760
 completed parts i'm laying out on this 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.220
 textured surface surface salary 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.160
 invoice down that is spread on 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.140
 smooth side need to put a pebble 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.140
 around it extruder on unit 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.990
 then the basis for earrings and trim 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.990
 all blade 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.710
 derived basics and beads separately 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.660
 I bake the temperature and long 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.340
 baking, look at the package 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.440
 polymer clay from which you sculpt 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.800
 after baking with a thin drill 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.360
 manually i make a hole bottom and top 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.360
 basis for earrings 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.270
 I collect on the bottom glass pins 

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:05.249
 beads and polymer clay beads and 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.249
 I paste drilled and earlier holes 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.979
 and on top I glue the pin with the loop behind 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.470
 which will be attached to the shackle 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.289
 face varnish pebble 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.599
 parts made poppy and ghana 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.599
 polymer clay bead bottom 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.180
 waiting for the varnish to dry and going 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.490
 earrings assembly using round pliers 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.920
 I have such a beautiful decoration 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.960
 It turned out on the same principle 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.050
 make earrings and in any other 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.280
 colors and can also 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.910
 experiment from the form of these 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.310
 earrings 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.070
 you saw i did not use the mold in 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.800
 pure form I used a combination 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.350
 different forms which gives more room for 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.270
 fantasies just take those molds 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.490
 which you have and try 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.640
 play with them try to make 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.070
 I am sure you have different combinations 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.410
 there are a lot of ideas and such earrings 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.960
 may perfectly fit your image 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.040
 I wish you creative success and 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.100
 inspiration 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.270

 ethnic style 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.360
 as well as a very interesting technique in 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.790
 which I completed the balloon pendant 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.950
