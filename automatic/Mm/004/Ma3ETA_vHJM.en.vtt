00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
me diarrhea I was so nervous about that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.880 
me diarrhea I was so nervous about that
and<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:12.900> did<00:03:13.900> end<00:03:14.020> up<00:03:14.140> teaching<00:03:14.320> quite<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.680> few

and I did end up teaching quite a few

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.670 
and I did end up teaching quite a few
classes<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:16.360> then<00:03:16.840> eventually<00:03:17.110> through

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
classes and then eventually through

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.190 
classes and then eventually through
performing<00:03:18.459> various<00:03:19.390> shows<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.900> would<00:03:20.050> ask

performing various shows you would ask

there are several reasons for doing that
one<00:04:08.400> was<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:09.180> fact<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.480> it's<00:04:09.720> been<00:04:09.870> part<00:04:10.080> of

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.620 
other reason for that too is I didn't
want<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.830> lose<00:04:35.070> perspective<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:36.090> being<00:04:36.450> a

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
want to lose perspective of being a

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.860 
want to lose perspective of being a
student<00:04:36.980> I<00:04:37.980> had<00:04:38.490> been<00:04:38.700> teaching<00:04:39.210> dads<00:04:39.660> and

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
student I had been teaching dads and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.720 
student I had been teaching dads and
being<00:04:40.050> an<00:04:40.140> artist<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.920> everything<00:04:41.520> I've<00:04:41.640> been

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
being an artist and everything I've been

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.270 
being an artist and everything I've been
doing<00:04:42.000> has<00:04:42.120> been<00:04:42.180> very<00:04:42.600> much<00:04:42.690> focused<00:04:43.110> on<00:04:43.860> ego

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
doing has been very much focused on ego

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.720 
doing has been very much focused on ego
or<00:04:44.550> or<00:04:45.510> it<00:04:46.260> instigates<00:04:46.830> your<00:04:47.010> ego<00:04:47.280> in<00:04:47.400> order<00:04:47.640> to

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
or or it instigates your ego in order to

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.120 
or or it instigates your ego in order to
perform<00:04:47.910> well<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.870> figure<00:04:49.200> why<00:04:49.710> not<00:04:49.740> do

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
perform well and I figure why not do

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.670 
perform well and I figure why not do
something<00:04:50.400> that's<00:04:50.930> very<00:04:51.930> much<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.169> opposite

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
something that's very much the opposite

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.320 
something that's very much the opposite
for<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.310> while<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.700> just<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.060> don't<00:04:54.210> lose

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
for a while and just so you don't lose

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.900 
for a while and just so you don't lose
perspective<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.669> consider<00:04:56.669> myself

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
perspective of that I consider myself

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.140 
perspective of that I consider myself
Cambodian<00:04:57.780> Canadian<00:04:58.610> part<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.700> what<00:04:59.820> I<00:04:59.850> love

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
Cambodian Canadian part of what I love

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.760 
Cambodian Canadian part of what I love
most<00:05:00.450> about<00:05:00.660> Canada<00:05:01.230> is<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.380> fact<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.620> we

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
most about Canada is the fact that we

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.250 
most about Canada is the fact that we
celebrate<00:05:02.190> multiculturalism<00:05:02.970> not<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:04.020> as<00:05:04.230> a

learn more about different cultures and
it's<00:05:14.910> very<00:05:15.060> well<00:05:15.210> celebrated<00:05:15.720> here<00:05:15.900> in<00:05:15.960> Canada

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
it's very well celebrated here in Canada

it's very well celebrated here in Canada
I<00:05:17.220> have<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:17.790> hard<00:05:18.000> time<00:05:18.210> deciding<00:05:18.540> between

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
I have a hard time deciding between

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.560 
I have a hard time deciding between
Cambodia<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.830> Canada<00:05:20.310> which<00:05:20.520> one<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:20.880> my<00:05:21.030> home

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
Cambodia and Canada which one is my home

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.830 
Cambodia and Canada which one is my home
partly<00:05:22.229> because<00:05:22.410> I<00:05:23.340> consider<00:05:24.000> both<00:05:24.150> places<00:05:24.660> my

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
partly because I consider both places my

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.450 
partly because I consider both places my
home<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.350> spend<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:25.860> good<00:05:26.010> amount<00:05:26.190> of<00:05:26.280> time

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
home and I spend a good amount of time

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.290 
home and I spend a good amount of time
in<00:05:26.520> both<00:05:26.790> countries<00:05:27.030> I<00:05:28.669> think<00:05:29.669> my<00:05:30.000> upbringing

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
in both countries I think my upbringing

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.200 
in both countries I think my upbringing
and<00:05:31.110> sort<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:31.860> lessons<00:05:32.280> in<00:05:32.400> life<00:05:32.610> if<00:05:32.910> you<00:05:32.940> will
