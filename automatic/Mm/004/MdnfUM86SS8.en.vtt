00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.610
 here we receive the recipes from the room 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.070
 of revenues 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.730
 we add one with the flour which is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.390
 sieve a sieve in the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.029
 Wood lathe for 10 to 12 minutes 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 the mass already ready at the point serginho it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 up this orange lift goes down 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.520
 this hopper that arrives at the equipment 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.770
 called divider advisor is established 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.899
 a cut - off weight of each point follows 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.210
 for the scorer in the scorer 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.010
 it takes a sphere shape 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 geometrically more stable following 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.510
 pro presentation where she will rest 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.690
 for 13 minutes 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.890
 this award is used for modeling 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.449
 be facilitated 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.449
 in the next step that the modeler 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.469
 later on to bed 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.559
 fermentation where it has its volume 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.309
 increased 1 temperature humidity and time 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 well fermented into the oven and 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.850
 bake in the oven for about half an hour was 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 removed from the baking pan mechanically 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.119
 lend for cooling around 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.210
 one hour one ten 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.420
 wetland at the optimum temperature to be 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.420
 packed 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.130
 how many breads are produced here by 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.560
 hour 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.820
 in this line we have the ability to 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.979
 two thousand loaves an hour 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 how long does this entire production take 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.310
 around four o'clock 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 I visited this entire production line 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.259
 here with you and realized that the machines 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.170
 all are arranged by a certain 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.990
 way that neither out is the motto 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.490
 People can call from high up and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.450
 why do you use this kind of 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.770
 layout and layout time main function 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.640
 better use of our space 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.130
 physical security of guaranteed 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 employees, especially in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.600
 maintenance and sanitation operations and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.470
 also the logical sequence of the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.899
 loaf bread 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.840
 this layout helps in communication between 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.720
 the sector and another yes there is doubt because 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 the equipment is again close 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.400
 from one another 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.410
 any emergency a team team 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.340
 can be quickly mounted on the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.890
 replacement of equipment 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.019
 automatic operation 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.690
 It happens that sometimes you change that 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.000
 format the last major change was the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.660
 arrival of our stamper a few years 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.570
 behind 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.090
 the operation was manual removal of bread 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.739
 of the oven with this equipment the bread leaves 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.650
 automatically through a scene of 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.730
 suction cups by following the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.329
 imprisonment 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.430
 How did you get in this layout? 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.750
 done very rationally through 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.630
 of the quality control department 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.590
 and industrial management a lack of 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.260
 foods 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.760
 never the raw material to enter into 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.519
 contact with the finished product 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.620
 avoid cross-contamination you too 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.079
 have to gain agility or be very 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.180
 more alone and pack the product in a 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.310
 region close to its dispatch and the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.820
 to think of the factory on account of sale 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.810
 may be a consequence of a layout 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.850
 inappropriate 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.959
 the consequence may be the loss of 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.230
 productivity 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.880
 that is, if you do not make a 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.730
 logical sequence of operations 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.769
 you lose other productivity 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.930
 mainly due to a 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.669
 food is the contamination 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.720
 if you contaminate the bread for example with 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.360
 flour 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.220
 Raw person will carry a 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.050
 development of mold in the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.050
 bread that decreases your shelf life 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.550
 with all these equipment here in the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.280
 you should think about maintaining 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.480
 them how this is organized 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 maintenance 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.130
 we rely on the department of 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.750
 industrial maintenance and how I spoke 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:08.160
 there are two types of maintenance 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.850
 preventive and the collective what is the 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.730
 Preventive preventive maintenance is 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.990
 that one can program a 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.280
 contact with maintenance personnel 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.380
 industrial 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.830
 We can program a 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.480
 range on the line one stop on the line 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:32.810
 next to change the equipment 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:34.860
 change a part and corrective maintenance 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.290
 unfortunately for more you program and 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.680
 preventive maintenance emergencies 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.020
 happens, unfortunately, in the case of 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.220
 a collective injury to the company is 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.810
 bigger 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.290
 usually I did in the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.900
 production or displacement of 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.880
 to replace the equipment then either 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.160
 say that a factory to maintain the good 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.229
 Productivity needs to think very carefully 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.490
 layout and maintenance of the 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.729
 equipment 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.010
 for sure el hanout badly thought and 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.750
 absence of preventive maintenance and 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.160
 directly reduce the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.260
 productivity 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.820
 Look how interesting you already had. 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.060
 stopped to think about it 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.710
 of this relationship between layout 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.560
 maintenance and productivity 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.919
 I'm not learning until 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.919
 the next
