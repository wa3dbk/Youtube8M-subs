grief<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:40.360> didn't<00:03:41.360> do<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> good<00:03:41.600> job<00:03:41.660> because<00:03:41.960> I

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
grief it didn't do a good job because I

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.320 
grief it didn't do a good job because I
booted<00:03:42.320> them<00:03:42.590> before<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.040> can<00:03:43.190> just<00:03:43.330> really

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
booted them before you can just really

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.030 
booted them before you can just really
do<00:03:44.540> some<00:03:44.750> damage<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.330> my<00:03:47.690> server<00:03:49.090> now

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
do some damage and this is my server now

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.290 
do some damage and this is my server now
sometimes<00:03:52.040> people<00:03:52.310> don't<00:03:52.430> join<00:03:52.670> sometimes

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
sometimes people don't join sometimes
