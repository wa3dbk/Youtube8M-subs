I wanted to go out and dive a wreath
because<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.190> think<00:00:11.420> deep<00:00:12.420> diving<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> best

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410

this mud bog we are going to be going

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.690 
this mud bog we are going to be going
out<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> world<00:00:33.920> about<00:00:34.920> five<00:00:35.160> miles<00:00:35.370> away

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
out to the world about five miles away

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.040 
out to the world about five miles away
that's<00:00:36.000> pretty<00:00:36.210> murky<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.809> today

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that's pretty murky out there today

that's pretty murky out there today
right<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:37.410> are<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> freshwater

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
right now are we going to a freshwater

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
right now are we going to a freshwater
hole<00:00:40.520> yes<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.360> take<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:46.399> there

hole yes well we can take you there
pretty<00:00:48.690> spectacular<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.969> unfortunately

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
pretty spectacular to see unfortunately

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
pretty spectacular to see unfortunately
there<00:00:51.120> isn't<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> great<00:00:51.600> amount<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.230> pretty

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
there isn't a great amount of pretty

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.680 
there isn't a great amount of pretty
marine<00:00:53.520> life<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
marine life like we have out on the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
marine life like we have out on the
Barrier<00:00:54.989> Reef<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.820> not

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
Barrier Reef because there's really not

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.930 
Barrier Reef because there's really not
that<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:57.360> living<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:59.730> have

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that much living in them and we have

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.080 
that much living in them and we have
some<00:01:00.629> Blue<00:01:00.809> Hole<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.460> northwest<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
some Blue Hole to the northwest that is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.590 
some Blue Hole to the northwest that is
probably<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.860> 75<00:01:07.860> feet<00:01:08.040> across<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
probably about 75 feet across and it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.429 
probably about 75 feet across and it
drops<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.400> 267<00:01:11.400> feets<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.909> hold<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:13.140> I've

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
drops to 267 feets on hold because I've

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.690 
drops to 267 feets on hold because I've
never<00:01:13.590> been<00:01:13.710> down<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
and in that particular blue hole we'll

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.289 
and in that particular blue hole we'll
talk<00:01:26.390> about<00:01:26.979> regional<00:01:27.979> climate<00:01:28.789> region<00:01:29.119> where

talk about regional climate region where

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.350 
talk about regional climate region where
salt<00:01:29.780> water<00:01:30.259> mixture<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:31.270> particles<00:01:32.270> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:47.440 
sinking freshwater and seawater are

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
traps they decay and snow pace that as

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.330 
traps they decay and snow pace that as
you<00:01:47.719> pass<00:01:48.140> through<00:01:48.439> that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
you pass through that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.730 
you pass through that
beep<00:01:50.210> thick<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.659> then<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:50.899> Drake<00:01:51.170> how<00:01:51.320> bloated

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
beep thick and then we Drake how bloated

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:13.900 
beep thick and then we Drake how bloated
about<00:01:51.920> 65<00:01:52.490> feet<00:01:52.520> and<00:02:06.429> my<00:02:10.510> fresh<00:02:11.510> water<00:02:12.910> thank

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
about 65 feet and my fresh water thank

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.589 
about 65 feet and my fresh water thank
you<00:02:14.030> for<00:02:14.209> asking

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
you for asking

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.710 
you for asking
that's<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.500> very<00:02:15.709> good<00:02:15.890> question<00:02:16.040> because<00:02:16.819> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
that's a very good question because the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.839 
that's a very good question because the
nature<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.349> its<00:02:18.620> formation<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.280> exactly<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
nature of its formation is exactly the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.340 
nature of its formation is exactly the
same<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> hole<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.900> see<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
same as the hole that you see in the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.100 
same as the hole that you see in the
ocean<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.100> I'm<00:02:22.730> assuming<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.420> way<00:02:23.870> back

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
ocean and I'm assuming that way back

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.660 
ocean and I'm assuming that way back
when<00:02:24.140> they<00:02:24.560> were<00:02:24.590> first<00:02:24.890> discovered<00:02:24.950> when<00:02:25.549> you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
when they were first discovered when you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.180 
when they were first discovered when you
look<00:02:26.630> down<00:02:26.810> where<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.680> had<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:27.920> beautiful

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
look down where you had that beautiful

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.820 
look down where you had that beautiful
light<00:02:28.790> colored<00:02:29.150> turquoise<00:02:29.330> water<00:02:29.870> suddenly

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
light colored turquoise water suddenly

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.830 
light colored turquoise water suddenly
there<00:02:31.010> was<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> deep<00:02:31.370> sonic<00:02:31.730> fan<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.360> was<00:02:32.390> blue

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
there was a deep sonic fan it was blue

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.470 
there was a deep sonic fan it was blue
and<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.940> they<00:02:35.030> call<00:02:35.209> them<00:02:35.330> blue<00:02:35.569> holes<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.319> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
and so they call them blue holes but the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:48.400 
and so they call them blue holes but the
formation<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.569> identical<00:02:45.910> we<00:02:46.910> really<00:02:47.540> could

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
formation is identical we really could

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.440 
formation is identical we really could
be<00:02:48.560> probably<00:02:49.250> correct<00:02:49.760> should<00:02:50.000> call<00:02:50.180> them<00:02:50.299> all

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
be probably correct should call them all

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.059 
be probably correct should call them all
sinkholes

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.449
