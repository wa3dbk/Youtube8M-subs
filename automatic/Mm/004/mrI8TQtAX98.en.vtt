00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
issues with their piano I figured out a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.460 
issues with their piano I figured out a
couple<00:00:14.070> things<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.630> you<00:00:15.630> could<00:00:15.839> fix<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.320> your

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
couple things that you could fix on your

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.750 
couple things that you could fix on your
own<00:00:18.560> just<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:19.740> doing<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.189> couple<00:00:20.369> quick<00:00:20.730> steps

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
own just by doing a couple quick steps

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.490 
own just by doing a couple quick steps
we'll<00:00:23.760> start<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.300> pedals<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:27.230> go<00:00:28.230> through<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
we'll start with pedals and go through a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
we'll start with pedals and go through a
couple<00:00:28.710> things<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:29.699> I'll<00:00:29.880> go

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
couple things on that and then I'll go

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.860 
couple things on that and then I'll go
over<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.289> keyboard<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> keys

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
over to the keyboard and and the keys

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
over to the keyboard and and the keys
and<00:00:34.140> show<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.350> some<00:00:35.040> things<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.550> could

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and show you some things that you could

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.770 
and show you some things that you could
look<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:37.170> start<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:38.390> was<00:00:39.390> having<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
look for so to start I was having a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.010 
look for so to start I was having a
problem<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.430> notes<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
problem with the the notes the the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.279 
problem with the the notes the the
farthest<00:00:43.410> pedal<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:45.960> here

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
farthest pedal to the to the right here

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.310 
farthest pedal to the to the right here
and<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.620> sustains<00:00:51.469> everything<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:54.320> what

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and that sustains everything so what

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.220 
and that sustains everything so what
happened<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:58.969> this<00:00:59.969> rod<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.780> comes<00:01:00.960> up

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
happened was this rod that comes up

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.380 
happened was this rod that comes up
there<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:04.080> metal<00:01:04.439> rod

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
there you can see that little metal rod

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.730 
there you can see that little metal rod
it<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.659> sure<00:01:06.840> that's<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it to make sure that's in there and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.660 
it to make sure that's in there and
another<00:01:08.280> thing<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> tighten

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
another thing is you have to tighten

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.710 
another thing is you have to tighten
this<00:01:11.970> screw<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> right<00:01:14.720> keep

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
this screw all the way to the right keep

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
this screw all the way to the right keep
on<00:01:15.869> tightening<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> until<00:01:19.070> until<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.280> whole

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
on tightening it until until this whole

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.520 
on tightening it until until this whole
entire<00:01:20.850> row<00:01:21.240> comes<00:01:21.780> off<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.790> strings<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
entire row comes off the strings so it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
entire row comes off the strings so it
sustains<00:01:28.880> know<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:30.000> well<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
sustains know how well you can see that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.260 
sustains know how well you can see that
but<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.509> next<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> middle<00:01:35.220> pedal<00:01:35.430> down

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
but the next one is a middle pedal down

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.249 
but the next one is a middle pedal down
here<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:40.740> sustains<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> bottom<00:01:41.729> half<00:01:42.259> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
here that sustains the bottom half you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.700 
here that sustains the bottom half you
can<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.619> these<00:01:43.829> are<00:01:44.930> these<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:45.960> being<00:01:46.470> lifted

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
can see these are these are being lifted

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.700 
can see these are these are being lifted
off<00:01:47.009> another<00:01:47.430> side's<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:48.140> I'm<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
off another side's not I'm gonna do the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.710 
off another side's not I'm gonna do the
right<00:01:52.250> where<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.369> all<00:01:53.520> lift<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.600> the

right where they all lift off the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
right where they all lift off the
strengths<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> finding<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.009> pedal<00:01:56.520> all<00:01:56.670> the

strengths and finding the pedal all the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.069 
strengths and finding the pedal all the
way<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.180> left<00:01:59.060> comes<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.299> over<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.899> with

way to the left comes up over here with

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.179 
way to the left comes up over here with
this<00:02:01.229> bar<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.520> pushes<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:04.649> whole<00:02:04.890> row

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this bar and pushes this this whole row

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.279 
this bar and pushes this this whole row
of<00:02:05.549> keys<00:02:06.090> closer<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> piano<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:10.080> kind

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
of keys closer to the piano and it kind

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.220 
of keys closer to the piano and it kind
of<00:02:10.349> makes<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.679> softer<00:02:11.190> softer<00:02:11.879> sound

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
of makes a softer softer sound

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.979 
of makes a softer softer sound
here's<00:02:13.590> here's<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.280> without<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:16.590> here's<00:02:17.989> here

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
here's here's it without and here's here

that's that you have to do the same

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.130 
that's that you have to do the same
thing<00:02:28.860> turn<00:02:29.849> this<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.269> right<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.870> tighten

it up and that will that will drive the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.170 
it up and that will that will drive the
bar<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.680> goes<00:02:34.980> up<00:02:36.049> tighter<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.239> lifts<00:02:39.750> off

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
bar that goes up tighter so it lifts off

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.350 
bar that goes up tighter so it lifts off
this<00:02:42.180> off<00:02:42.450> these<00:02:42.659> metal<00:02:44.810> metal<00:02:45.810> things
