00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
one thing about this is it's not it's a

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.110 
one thing about this is it's not it's a
one<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.239> back<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.310> mirrored<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.060> you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
one way back so it's not mirrored so you

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.699 
one way back so it's not mirrored so you
can't<00:02:45.629> like<00:02:45.840> shuffle<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.379> because<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.650> will

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
can't like shuffle it because it will

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.759 
can't like shuffle it because it will
look<00:02:47.069> messed<00:02:47.340> up<00:02:47.599> like<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:48.810> okay<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.500> if<00:02:49.680> I

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
look messed up like this okay so if I

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.160 
look messed up like this okay so if I
shuffle<00:02:50.159> it<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.239> wrong<00:02:51.420> way<00:02:51.540> around<00:02:51.599> and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
shuffle it like the wrong way around and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.930
