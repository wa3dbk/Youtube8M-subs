00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to you and probably one of the best

to you and probably one of the best
video<00:00:50.219> games<00:00:50.610> ever<00:00:51.210> made<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> first<00:00:53.520> off<00:00:53.730> what

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the first element I'd like to examine of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.280 
the first element I'd like to examine of
this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.670> gameplay

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
this is the gameplay

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.610

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
another level and in making it even more

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
another level and in making it even more
excellent<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> first<00:01:12.390> time

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
performances I think I've ever heard in

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.179 
performances I think I've ever heard in
movies<00:03:54.980> or<00:03:55.010> in<00:03:55.370> games<00:03:55.639> or<00:03:56.030> in<00:03:56.180> TV<00:03:57.189> anywhere

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
movies or in games or in TV anywhere

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.339 
movies or in games or in TV anywhere
that<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.459> can<00:03:58.699> think<00:03:58.879> of<00:03:59.090> or<00:03:59.659> voice<00:03:59.930> acting

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
that you can think of or voice acting

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.110 
that you can think of or voice acting
might<00:04:00.469> appear<00:04:00.739> this<00:04:00.919> is<00:04:01.129> one<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.939> most

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
might appear this is one of the most

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.720 
might appear this is one of the most
outstanding<00:04:02.959> performances<00:04:03.859> I<00:04:04.099> think<00:04:04.639> I've

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
outstanding performances I think I've

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.360 
outstanding performances I think I've
ever<00:04:04.760> heard<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.439> characters<00:04:06.829> in<00:04:06.859> baldur's

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
ever heard so the characters in baldur's

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.219 
ever heard so the characters in baldur's
gate<00:04:07.430> two<00:04:07.760> are<00:04:08.060> just<00:04:08.629> absolutely<00:04:09.370> astounding

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
gate two are just absolutely astounding

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.689 
gate two are just absolutely astounding
there<00:04:12.229> are<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.439> few<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.889> just<00:04:13.099> don't<00:04:13.250> work<00:04:13.370> out

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699 
there are a few that just don't work out

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.789 
there are a few that just don't work out
but<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.389> good<00:04:14.540> ones<00:04:14.659> really<00:04:14.959> outweigh<00:04:15.470> the

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
but the good ones really outweigh the

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.339 
but the good ones really outweigh the
bad<00:04:15.979> ones<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:17.449> next<00:04:17.690> thing<00:04:17.810> I'd<00:04:17.930> like<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.139> talk

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
bad ones the next thing I'd like to talk

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.680 
bad ones the next thing I'd like to talk
about<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.829> thought<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.400> there<00:04:20.209> any<00:04:20.449> depth

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
about is the thought is there any depth

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.930 
about is the thought is there any depth
to<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:21.019> game<00:04:21.259> there<00:04:22.099> is<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.280> surprising

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
to this game there is a surprising

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.240 
to this game there is a surprising
amount<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.270> depth<00:04:23.539> here<00:04:23.780> baldur's<00:04:24.590> gate<00:04:24.620> was

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
amount of depth here baldur's gate was

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.879 
amount of depth here baldur's gate was
not<00:04:25.460> very<00:04:25.669> deep<00:04:26.199> baldur's<00:04:27.199> gate<00:04:27.229> do<00:04:27.590> takes

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
not very deep baldur's gate do takes

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.219 
not very deep baldur's gate do takes
that<00:04:28.159> and<00:04:28.370> really<00:04:28.970> adds<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.539> whole<00:04:29.570> new<00:04:29.990> level

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
that and really adds a whole new level

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.600 
that and really adds a whole new level
of<00:04:30.970> depth<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.330> is<00:04:32.389> just<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.259> think<00:04:33.770> worthy<00:04:34.490> of

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
of depth that is just I think worthy of

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.210 
of depth that is just I think worthy of
praise<00:04:34.880> it's<00:04:35.780> very<00:04:36.020> good<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.530> really<00:04:36.740> do<00:04:37.070> get

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
praise it's very good you really do get

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.219 
praise it's very good you really do get
invested<00:04:37.789> in<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:38.539> story<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.110> are

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
invested in the story and you are

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.320 
invested in the story and you are
interested<00:04:39.770> in<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:39.979> ideas<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:41.030> story

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
interested in the ideas the story

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.879 
interested in the ideas the story
presents<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:43.729> next<00:04:44.000> thing<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.750> script<00:04:45.080> the

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
presents the next thing the script the

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.339 
presents the next thing the script the
diction<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.729> dialogue<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.930> script<00:04:48.229> is

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
diction and the dialogue the script is

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.890 
diction and the dialogue the script is
very<00:04:48.680> good<00:04:48.949> in<00:04:48.979> this<00:04:49.220> game<00:04:49.490> as<00:04:49.759> true<00:04:50.719> with<00:04:50.750> most

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
very good in this game as true with most

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.249 
very good in this game as true with most
video<00:04:51.380> games<00:04:51.440> it's<00:04:52.250> not<00:04:52.520> necessarily<00:04:53.270> on<00:04:53.449> the

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
video games it's not necessarily on the

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.589 
video games it's not necessarily on the
level<00:04:54.469> with<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.770> great<00:04:55.009> film<00:04:55.310> script<00:04:55.699> but

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
level with a great film script but

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.209 
level with a great film script but
really<00:04:57.020> I<00:04:57.169> think<00:04:57.259> the<00:04:57.530> script<00:04:57.800> helps<00:04:58.070> us

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
really I think the script helps us

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.820 
really I think the script helps us
understand<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.330> characters<00:04:59.750> there<00:05:00.590> are<00:05:00.650> some

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
understand the characters there are some

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.409 
understand the characters there are some
moments<00:05:00.949> of<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.490> like<00:05:01.639> that's<00:05:01.880> kind<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.240> well

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
moments of just like that's kind of well

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.420 
moments of just like that's kind of well
written<00:05:02.659> for<00:05:03.440> our<00:05:03.469> moments<00:05:03.889> where<00:05:04.039> it's<00:05:04.159> less

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
written for our moments where it's less

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.990 
written for our moments where it's less
than<00:05:04.479> stellar<00:05:05.479> but<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:06.169> think<00:05:07.009> it<00:05:07.190> really<00:05:07.520> helps

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
than stellar but I think it really helps

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.409 
than stellar but I think it really helps
to<00:05:08.060> convey<00:05:08.539> the<00:05:09.409> feeling<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:10.009> I<00:05:10.250> think<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:11.300> is

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
to convey the feeling and I think it is

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.930 
to convey the feeling and I think it is
important<00:05:11.930> that<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:12.889> should<00:05:13.190> read<00:05:13.400> every

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
important that you should read every

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.029 
important that you should read every
single<00:05:13.969> line<00:05:14.599> that<00:05:15.409> you<00:05:15.440> get<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.830> opportunity

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
single line that you get the opportunity

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.640 
single line that you get the opportunity
to<00:05:16.400> read<00:05:16.699> it<00:05:17.240> really<00:05:17.570> adds<00:05:17.779> to<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.199> experience

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
to read it really adds to the experience

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.360 
to read it really adds to the experience
the<00:05:20.580> next<00:05:20.850> thing<00:05:21.030> is<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.750> melody<00:05:22.169> how<00:05:23.040> does<00:05:23.250> it

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
the next thing is the melody how does it

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.150 
the next thing is the melody how does it
flow<00:05:23.669> this<00:05:24.479> game<00:05:24.720> flows<00:05:24.990> very<00:05:25.110> well<00:05:25.530> there

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
flow this game flows very well there

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.590 
flow this game flows very well there
really<00:05:26.310> are<00:05:26.550> no<00:05:26.580> moments<00:05:27.120> where<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.389> feels

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
really are no moments where it feels

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.570 
really are no moments where it feels
like<00:05:27.900> something<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.740> out<00:05:28.889> of<00:05:28.949> place<00:05:29.100> or

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
like something is out of place or

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.200 
like something is out of place or
something<00:05:30.180> doesn't<00:05:30.630> belong<00:05:31.729> and<00:05:32.729> this<00:05:32.970> goes

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
something doesn't belong and this goes

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.999 
something doesn't belong and this goes
for<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.780> throne<00:05:33.990> of<00:05:34.020> bhaal<00:05:34.259> expansion<00:05:34.860> pack

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
for the throne of bhaal expansion pack

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.900 
for the throne of bhaal expansion pack
reiterating<00:05:38.009> sort<00:05:38.280> of<00:05:38.340> what<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.460> said<00:05:38.759> with

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
reiterating sort of what I said with

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.180 
reiterating sort of what I said with
baldur's<00:05:39.690> gate<00:05:39.720> one<00:05:40.020> get<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.470> expansion<00:05:41.039> pack

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
baldur's gate one get the expansion pack

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.999 
baldur's gate one get the expansion pack
to<00:05:41.910> Baldur's<00:05:42.210> Gate<00:05:42.270> 2<00:05:42.600> it<00:05:43.199> really<00:05:43.440> adds<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.860> lot

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
to Baldur's Gate 2 it really adds a lot

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.800 
to Baldur's Gate 2 it really adds a lot
and<00:05:44.490> nothing<00:05:44.940> in<00:05:45.060> there<00:05:45.210> feels<00:05:45.419> out<00:05:45.630> of<00:05:45.660> place

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
and nothing in there feels out of place

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.230 
and nothing in there feels out of place
in<00:05:46.800> fact<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.220> story<00:05:47.520> just<00:05:47.610> feels<00:05:47.970> like<00:05:48.120> it

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
in fact the story just feels like it

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.930 
in fact the story just feels like it
flows<00:05:48.509> from<00:05:49.350> shadows<00:05:50.009> want<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.520> throw<00:05:50.789> in<00:05:50.850> a
