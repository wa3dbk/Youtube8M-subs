00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:02.104
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:07.912
 and I will tell you a few sentences how to get a driver's license quickly, and basically how to sign up quickly 

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:15.620
 for the right course in my case it was a course for a motorcycle, of course, everyone can be in yours. 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.654
 From the passenger car to the truck. 

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:26.577
 After 19 January 2013, the rules unfortunately changed and definitely disadvantaged the students 

00:00:26.577 --> 00:00:32.673
 so be better prepared for everything, the bureaucrats' fantasy at the moment knows no boundaries. 

00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:41.311
 Once you were straight to the nursery, naked and cheerful, you were signing a contract, practically doing everything 

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:49.752
 for you, but now it has been a bit complicated, especially for long distance students, 

00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:56.893
 so you're from Bialystok, you're studying in Wroclaw and it's not as easy as it used to be. 

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:04.037
 I assume, of course, that you do not have a category document, and you need a lawsuit for yesterday and want to sign up 

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:05.738
 on the course as soon as possible. 

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:10.328
 From what I would start - I strongly advise you from medical examinations. 

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:15.308
 It really depends on the doctor whether you are capable or not able. 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.622
 Especially as you make higher categories for trailers or trucks. 

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:29.628
 There are also psychotestes that you must do at the psychologist in the nearest transport psychology lab. 

00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:37.799
 You better not sign anything with the driving school or give them some money until you really know whether you qualify 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.534
 healthily or not. 

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:41.840
 Well, I assume you qualify. 

00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:49.120
 So you can simply go to an organizational meeting for a driving school, then usually a doctor is on the spot. 

00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:59.870
 If the school is small, poor or has few students, the doctor does not have to look for a doctor's office 

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:08.500
 but a doctor authorized to research drivers, not any family doctors, ophthalmologists or any other specialists, 

00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:12.360
 but not authorized to examine drivers. 

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:16.200
 Of course, after the examination, the doctor gives you an appropriate decision. 

00:02:17.257 --> 00:02:23.540
 As I mentioned - schools do not have psychologists, so if you want C, C + E, D- higher categories 

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:28.810
 you must come to the psychological laboratory before the course. 

00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:35.340
 As a rule, at school they will give you an application to issue a driving license, they want to make it a little easier to catch this student 

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:44.390
 of course, you can get the same application, get it at the municipal office and in the nursery usually sign an initial contract. 

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:48.300
 My initial contract for "motor" looked like this. 

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:51.550
 It was with the Euforia driving school. 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.160
 So it is a contract for a driving license category A 

00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:04.800
 What do I advise you to do a photo for driving license before, my photo looks like this. 

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.820
 Oh, that's how I look. 

00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:12.470
 In Wroclaw, the photographer is right next to the office. 

00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:17.560
 Myk, on the other hand, depends on this - you need one picture, they give you 5 or 6. 

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:21.030
 It cost me over PLN 30. 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.400
 And 5 photos were left as a souvenir. 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.830
 That is theoretically they must be without a headgear, without dark glasses - the photographer should do it 

00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:37.010
 to know, I will read here for more interested. 

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:41.460
 "Clear, current color photography, dimensions 3.5 cm x 4 cm. 

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:48.390
 To show the head from the position of the left profile with the left ear visible, maintaining even face lighting ... " 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.600
 The rest is blah, blah, blah. 

00:03:52.703 --> 00:03:53.450
 What's next? 

00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:59.520
 And finally you go to the office, or what you take the ID card - remember. 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.720
 In my case it was a photocopy of my driver's license. 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.790
 Well, I just had B and C driving licenses, you can have B1, for example, and you want to do B. 

00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:16.760
 You had A or A1 - you want to do B, that is, you generally want to expand your qualifications. 

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:23.420
 Take a photocopy of your driving license so that you do not look for it in the office. 

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:28.540
 Of course, you fill in the application earlier, the application, as I said, you could get in the nursery. 

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.280
 You can fill ... applications are in the office. 

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:35.580
 If you are underage, of course, parents' consent. 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.110
 As far as I know, there are some interpretations, that probably only the consent of one parent is enough. 

00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:46.390
 It happens differently, parents are divorced, the child is the subject of different games. 

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:52.170
 Let's say my dad is in America, mum here and what a son must somehow get a driver's license. 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:59.660
 And on the basis of this application will give you such a unique profile of the driver's candidate. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.230
 I arranged my candidate profile in Wrocław on ul. Zapolska from the hand. 

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.070
 It looks like this. 

00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:16.310
 Theoretically, it lasts for two days - as I told you, I got it right. 

00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:23.650
 There is a number of PPK, there is a category A, there is an instruction - "For more information about 

00:05:23.653 --> 00:05:34.890
 profile of the candidate for the driver or the process of obtaining permissions, visit the website PKK.pwpw.pl, or the page 

00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:38.380
 State Security Printing Works. 

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:44.170
 With this profile, you return to driving school and then calmly if you have not signed the contract 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.400
 you sign the contract again. 

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.340
 And you can finally join the class. 

00:05:49.973 --> 00:05:56.040
 So technically without this profile of the driver's candidate, the driver training center can not accept you 

00:05:56.505 --> 00:05:58.470
 towards students and train. 

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:01.050
 What are the most common problems? 

00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:08.090
 Of course, the basic is the lack of a doctor in a driving school, then you have to look for a study yourself. 

00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:14.160
 The second problem - I do not know how it will be solved, but at least at the end of June 2013, 

00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:22.270
 a non-resident student has to blame, if, say, he lives in Bialystok, he is a student in Wrocław 

00:06:22.268 --> 00:06:31.040
 he must go to the office in Bialystok, those several hundred kilometers, to form a profile of a candidate for a driver. 

00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:37.120
 This is the genius of our officials, our minister graciously reigning in these matters. 

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:43.750
 Also - why should not you drive through the Polish State Railways or some other. 

00:06:44.293 --> 00:06:47.900
 As I said, good schools organize most matters. 

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:54.400
 But nobody will go to the office for you, especially as you would sign it. 

00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:58.030
 At the end, said Darek Kraśnicki from Wroclaw. 

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:06.650
 I am happy to hear what your records looked like ... preparation for enrolling in a driving license course. 

00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:15.590
 Remember - it's best to start with a medical certificate, just like I did, although as a physician I had an easier matter. 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:25.330
 Well, you can only comment on whether everything went smoothly or on the contrary - everything was like a hill 

00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:27.700
 comment here under this video. 

00:07:28.267 --> 00:07:35.680
 So at the end I would like to recommend my driver research office in Wrocław again on ul. Żernickiej 215. 

00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:42.720
 After leaving my office, you receive such a ruling from the hand, regardless of the category 

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:44.130
 You need. 

00:07:44.518 --> 00:07:52.590
 Phone: 601 775 123 

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:59.370
 I also work with the transport psychology lab, that is, higher categories C, C + E, D are also welcome. 

00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:04.770
 At the end, bye bye and rubber trees on the course! 

00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:07.980
 Of course, pass the exam the first time.
