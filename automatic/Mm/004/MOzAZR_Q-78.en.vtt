00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
fishing over weed or over darks and then

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
fishing over weed or over darks and then
a<00:00:30.449> darker<00:00:30.929> fly<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.230> better<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:32.369> you're

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
a darker fly is better when you're

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.790

fishing over whites and a white pink
silver<00:00:35.309> type<00:00:35.760> fly<00:00:36.090> will<00:00:36.570> probably<00:00:36.930> catch<00:00:37.140> more

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
silver type fly will probably catch more

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.049 
silver type fly will probably catch more
fish<00:00:37.620> simply<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> creatures<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
fish simply because the creatures that

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.660 
fish simply because the creatures that
live<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.719> will<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.410> camouflaged<00:00:41.100> because

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
live there will be camouflaged because

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
live there will be camouflaged because
they<00:00:41.760> don't<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.540> easy<00:00:42.719> pickings<00:00:43.230> for
