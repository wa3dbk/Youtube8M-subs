00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.139
 about such a thing as insulation 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.049
 fleece type material polartec weeks 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.910
 as well as self production 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.990
 alloy company 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 come winter is coming to an end for me 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.359
 It seems quite relevant topic for 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.539
 of many people 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.670

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.359

 this clothes 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 all the pros and cons cons very little in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.489
 Mostly the advantages are: we will start 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.370
 consider a model khan han is a model 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.460
 danced warmer from polartek 300 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.530
 tests it means the density of the material here 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.070
 this sports jacket with big 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.020
 the amount of fog and the hood here we are

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.299
 material name 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.430
 we have a pocket on the sleeve 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.950
 we have a chest pocket outside pocket and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.420
 deep enough to hide in them here in on 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.580
 google and I could do was quietly 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.490
 big notebook have a passport here we have 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.320
 two standard pockets on the sides inside 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.829
 grid to choose from these we also have 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.070
 Zinka utyazki is also quite useful 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.070
 thing 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:43.030
 back seams are all made in flat 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.850
 option for more comfortable wearing 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.789
 This product also repeat it 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.509
 the product was worn by me from the act of combat every 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:55.689
 day all twelve hours a day in 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.789
 wash she was only once too 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.439
 but this again is a property of the material 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.899
 the fact that it does not cost so much to erase 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.390
 how much ordinary clarifying material 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.989
 completely hydrophobic not completely odorless 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.959
 soak up here is very good 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.620
 sanitary fittings again 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.060
 duraflex 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:22.079
 and lightning we have yukako 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:24.940
 very reliable well we have you 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:28.920
 inside pocket also on the grid for 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.590
 every little thing for money 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.950
 anything else well and strap for 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.950
 support 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.120
 looks like the water there option there will be 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.959
 has broken 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.959
 1 option 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:12.250
 how would the scroll sit well sized 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.920
 the alloy ruler is divided by 2 is 46 44 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.140
 46 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.510
 850 all 24 knocking someone missed something 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:28.570
 it will be necessary to look for such a model of such 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:33.190
 words of error in size well for 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.950
 An example of this is roughly sock comparable as 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.530
 This model looks with the same 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.230
 models of the same size of the same 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.270
 the color itself is just new again 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.570
 I repeat everything on the model is numbers 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.570
 rushed me to the act of combat every day and 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.940
 lived only one thing here is a comparison 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.570
 of the material 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.520
 I mean this little vox rolled up but 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.330
 it is very normal for fleece any fleece 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.519
 behaves the same here for purity the color is not 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.900
 changed not discolored after one 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.910
 washing here sleeves a little off 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.489
 pellets again because on 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.910
 edging more other material itself 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:23.200
 This material does not particularly species 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.250
 changed just got up again here 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.370
 carry 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.910
 also elbows most intense place 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.110
 erased and this elbows no holes after 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.110
 a little crumpled mattel 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.869
 and again I advise everyone 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.259
 clothes for tourists who like to run 

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:48.169
 those who are afraid of the cold is the most important 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:53.169
 the thing seems to me after the topic of running which 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.169
 need to know everything about this end before the meeting
