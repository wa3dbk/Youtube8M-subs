00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.050
 dear Mr. Kalkofe nice that it created for an interview on the spot 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.249
 we are currently on the growth path of 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.729
 Agatha Christie 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.539
 made in a very nice production 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.249
 and now a few questions 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.159
 to the general topic 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.429
 That's a small chance that he could not see a new one, for example 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.809
 from the Edgar Wallace parody of the wanker and new from Wixxer 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.339
 Now they are back to the Queen on small 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.339
 where does her penchant for this crime classic come from 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
 first somehow funny I do not think so England around 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.390
 I've always been fascinated and a bit old-fashioned England 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.590
 I do not always know one hundred percent what I was first 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.210
 faith 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.480
 in the test the very first was with umbrella charm and melon »of it I am 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.600
 just a giant giant cases 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.970
 and I do not think so ELV or so the first 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.710
 Seen in the repetition on television and choice really from scratch 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.060
 a hundred and Varela Meger away and have all my money and mine 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.350
 So everything I had and all my free time spent on it 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 Percent all the photos, small clippings, the sequences and «How to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.630
 because there was no video clip on super-8 and mine 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.250
 whole conformation Sgarbi Flintsbach spend projects and so on 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.020
 That's why I also learned 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.550
 to speak English as well as I can 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.170
 had to keep in contact with residents letter and wanted to read English title 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.810
 and the consequences see the perpetrators 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.850
 then, Edgar Wallace escaped the ECA wanted to movies in the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.940
 TV was running and he was also very intriguing 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.160
 for someone of that age and then at a time when it really is like that 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.530
 boring thrillers on television were so the commissioner and the like 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.850
 has not told me now as twelve-year-old so special 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.210
 fascinated and then came trouble for Chris i next and I found 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.730
 so 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.190
 to see all of these and see them and things to think about 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.439
 who must have been the culprit 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.920
 What was bizarre in Dissen happened to all this British charm percent 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.859
 stayed with me somewhere in the head and my very big love was 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.310
 getting bigger and bigger 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.810
 so everything is just what has to do with the old England and with which already 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.550
 lost with rounded the oil spill does not matter 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.389
 that has really shaped everything for my life 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.909
 but now, of course, use »so the city she is avowed feature film pro 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.120
 Week after end all this street-sweeping street sweep around 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.370
 in the crime radio plays but the ladies had in particular in other character 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.090
 yes, and India in the seventies eighties, I was not so 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.069
 very the 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.829
 for feature films for adults players so winters I believe that at the 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.489
 Most, maybe 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.269
 as a child has heard many games and records he thinks of as a 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.060
 Adult so that was my kids time I have nothing to do with it now 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.689
 if he has for such a phase 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.309
 of maybe ten years where you say no I do not remember those now 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.900
 Did not do it as a child and with that you come back to there and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.260
 Oh yes, he also has some sense and that's really nice too 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.040
 and then you can be so nostalgic about his he's early 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.520
 Reactivate childhood memories and then you will hear again 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.109
 Radio play and since then charred to hear international match and himself 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.280
 to make the picture in the head and so on 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.360
 and he, too, later on I found him there again and of annoyance 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.350
 for Chris Sigaty unlike the whole Dobritzsch classics like him 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.179
 see as huge for 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.169
 Even Jeff Heerema way to strangely never correct radio plays 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.949
 which I personally find very bad 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.919
 because I always found the movies and the one super Melbourne think about that 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.549
 we have a great the Defender Spitz 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.200
 Greetings to the accident remember with these tickets 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.780
 and if one of these fresh from the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.689
 % fulminanten percent growth ostrich final 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:34.839
 around 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.499
 With the help of the fruits they are actually specifying preparing their destination 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.629
 For this one has been preparing for this production 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:42.989
 you're more likely than Fran 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.549
 in% sales fell in civilian handicap 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.309
 through we had an opposite so I believe that it benefited me 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.829
 I so 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.069
 Woo percent that is the chance very much and that I saw you so much of it 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.579
 and heard 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.040
 «I've really seen a movie in my head all the time and have a movie 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.459
 all the characters seen sometimes you just have to come up the top is now 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.030
 Who our name is this jumbled of fiber that's just like that 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.399
 Let's start an old clock 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.760
 where the highest English names then others 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.160
 can only be read «The master device is recognized because always completely in the 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.010
 Nearby applicants but otherwise I have barely started for those I had 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.249
 This one has this feeling of these old ones 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:21.840
 English thriller percent 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.909
 and in the back of my mind as a film or as a 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.139
 TV booths as seen and he has just been a lot of fun 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.370
 there to be in there 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.870
 and also to be Apple pro who did not read that often and where I once went 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.360
 so big was Phoebe's would have been his 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.400
 Final in the long-haul now if the culprit 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.110
 Percent is presented next and so that was just great that once 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.150
 to be allowed to be 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.610
 I can not tell them how much I thank them for their invitation 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.479
 It will develop better that a host firmly holds the hand 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.840
 he is lucky polo 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.639
 or indicates a chair on the 4th 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.639
 sighing name SKM early from the square 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.819
 I am from a visit at 10 04 this morning and murder but Messi 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.159
 came back Dr 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.379
 and they have a problem asking me for advice 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.289
 I'm afraid it's a long story 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.300
 Until then Brussels took a short break then he described his 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.699
 dry precisely to what has happened before 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.069
 it was a short concise presentation and became of the small number of gentlemen 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.720
 with a forum in mind 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.979
 silently and with goodwill 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.429
 when Mister snatched out he had prevailed at first quietly 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:37.360
 Herten Coro 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.969
 UD thought 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.979
 that sounds very conclusive, he finally says 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.149
 they suspect that their friend Michel and other eleven are in the morning 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:49.789
 could be 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.080
 this suspicion was based only on one on the words the assumption 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.059
 Coral never went before I thought but this nourished termination, he said 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.989
 the fact that she herself was murdered the following day 

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:04.629
 Be a row at random 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.590
 and undoubtedly the city is doing much more, he died very suddenly 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.020
 but he was looked after by a respected nartz who knew well and this one did 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.520
 Scooby not suspicious special plays with the death certificate 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.210
 the states of the earth were not under-challenged 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.169
 the association also own desire 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.379
 and that means that a second kind had to confirm the document so we come 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.710
 to return to the crucial what Koch said properly 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.900
 they were there and they thought of it 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.009
 she said 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:39.800
 but he was murdered or not
