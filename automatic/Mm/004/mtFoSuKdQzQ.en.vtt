 Today we have on April 1 and then waiting for you 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.689

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.790
 merge and fill a good statka 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.000
 no super task we will fill 49 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.090
 percent win home young 46 percent 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.830
 Does this guide specifically for you I 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.470
 for a long time could not understand how at all 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.990
 can have less than 49 percent of wins in 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.550
 world of tanks because the world of tanks sharpened 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.150
 forty nine percent such a player 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.010
 considered the most common 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.810
 the average player for the first time I 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.060
 got interested in my statistics somewhere 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.550
 after 500 fights and of course I have to 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.070
 that time was exactly forty nine 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.260
 percent that is of particular help to your 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.110
 we did not render the team furrows as 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.270
 the saying does not spoil how to stop 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.390
 suck lollipop chups and achieve such 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.100
 outstanding result like me all 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.080
 very simply watch this guide and in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 precision performance of listed 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.920
 instructions went first and by 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.290
 the main 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.420
 stop merging if your team 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.820
 loses be the last to whom 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.310
 destroy if wins the more 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.740
 what's the point of merging as 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.200
 educational measures I recommend never 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.900
 do not go out of battle until its completion 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.299
 merge sit and see how the Allies play 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.830
 raki you could help them drag a fight 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.030
 now watch them foolishly 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.400
 poured forth ever nowhere ed 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.740
 first went into battle in a fast tank 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.590
 I want to rush forward in search 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.210
 adventure take on your hands stand on 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.490
 base until teammates do not 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.860
 will disperse on the flanks and will not go first 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.380
 lit up and only after that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.869
 choose the flank on which you will go 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.119
 help your allies if your hands 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.580
 itching to rush forward and face first 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.770
 standing at the base at the beginning of the battle is very 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.380
 help a lot to fix the machine and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.539
 never have to go flank 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.239
 just one two tanks them there fast 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.530
 merge and take you better prosrat 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.270
 flank but stay alive with something 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610
 by sacrificing yourself did for the pain 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.680
 just a couple of shots 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.500
 Ivanovich I am now pumping a firefly 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 I, too, stand at the base does not shine she 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.840
 always you generally swing windmills 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.989
 remember no a-20 this food no 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.110
 some of the trees and other remixes are only tyazh 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.170
 and fr only hardcore fireflies for the skilled 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.510
 boys are for cancer like you to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.600
 have a good stat download good 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.880
 easy to use tanks remember how 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.670
 rule light tanks from fourth 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.920
 levels have an increased level of battles 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.440
 It promised when the thread to fix only 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.209
 As they say the promised three years waiting 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.600
 but there are exceptions to this rule 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.810
 for example the Soviet light tank level 4 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.640
 T-80 is just such an exception is 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.209
 it is worth going through it 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.239
 to the legendary t-34 they are through fireflies from 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.140
 20 and t-50 created exclusively for 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.000
 suffering we go further where the tank tank 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.730
 thickest armor 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.459
 then why are you going to enemies 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.780
 barton do you even know what you have 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.720
 boards instead of armor 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.650
 paper clips 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.519
 corrugated cardboard which is 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.799
 ammunition tanks and engine always 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.810
 unfolds there to the enemy of the muzzle of this 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.730
 the rules are a hundred and five hundred exceptions so 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.340
 that it is not even a rule at all 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.970
 however in order to fill a measly 49 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.980
 percent you know about it completely 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.829
 do not have to figure it out with guns and 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.299
 ammunition do not be an idiot without shooting 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.010
 from large-bomb is not 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.859
 armor-piercing projectiles and from 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.480
 small-caliber pugalok bombs say 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.000
 you can not break through the enemy tanks 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.090
 armored pierce booking schemes 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.790

 as a bonus especially for those who 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.580
 does not want to learn anything 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.400
 standard vulnerable zones 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.030

 horn namely so nagibatory folders 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.650
 called the stereo tube you need to put on 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.100
 all tanks up to level five inclusive 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.220
 and on most tanks of the sixth level 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.060
 good luck horns are not complicated 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.580
 equipment 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.410
 you can rearrange the machine on the tank without 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.260
 any restrictions 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.150
 the same applies to equipment 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.880
 never going into battle without the usual 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.860
 repair kit and first aid kits convinced 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.740
 donators instead of the usual can take 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.560
 premium repair kit and first aid kit uncle 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.880
 Serb does not mind by the way about 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.010
 optional equipment 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.830
 and ride his iron horse in 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.230
 his battle must be equipped so 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.290
 reinforced aiming drives are placed on 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.400
 all tanks without exception if possible 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.510
 rapper about horns I wrote above 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.060
 equipment is best bought at 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.660
 sale for half the price so copy 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.340
 silver sales always happen 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.620
 suddenly and do not need to tell what 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.660
 pulls gold and what you can not remove 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.030
 aiming drives rearrange them to 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.610
 the next tank but because the equipment 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.830
 you do n't need to dismantle the complex 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.920
 equipment costs ten gold or 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.170
 fifty ruble if you do not have one and a half 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.300
 rubles fuck are you here at all in some 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.280
 toys you play take care to go 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.640
 collect empty bottles with homeless people 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.310
 or what is there now fashionable to collect as you 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.680
 you think that the most important thing in the world of tanks 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.990
 what is the greatest value 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.640
 in the game that does not buy for any money 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:19.290
 you equipage crew my young padawan need 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.690
 purposefully injected into transplant with 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.180
 one tank to another when you 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.460
 pumping a branch of 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.690
 you are not completely on the tank of the tenth level 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.380
 you should sit 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:33.169
 an experienced leg first crew 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.060
 it would be better if at least 6 or 7 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.389
 level you begin to transplant carriages 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.090
 heading cheap so that it does not hurt for 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.580
 aimlessly dumped experience remember 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.860
 the commander must be pulled out 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.380
 light bulb skill sixth sense 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.509
 like any skill it will work 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.639
 only after you turn off on 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.259
 one hundred percent so either ride with 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.910
 broken light or swing 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.370
 commander some useful skill 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.060
 then reset skill for gold or 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.610
 silver 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.970
 to take such a light bulb to the rest 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.009
 crew members repair repair all you do not 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.080
 you will be mistaken 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:11.500
 what do you think is unimportant in the world of tanks 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.880
 what the game does not need to strive 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.280
 unbelievable but the fact is this tank of the tenth 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.860
 level even forty nine percent 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.039
 victories on the tenth level are waiting for you only 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.470
 snot tears and misery it on tanks

 a player at the tenth level forty nine 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.409
 percent pirate so statke better 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.150
 raise playing at medium levels where 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:39.740
 full of interesting tanks on 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.889
 which you can quite yourself successfully 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.550
 bend down all living things and farm because 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:49.760
 dozens of not known farms that's all 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.940
 today wish you my crustaceans 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.979
 a friend of teammates better and ammo
