3<00:00:11.270> and<00:00:11.629> this<00:00:12.139> part<00:00:12.410> going<00:00:12.619> to<00:00:12.709> cover<00:00:12.889> some<00:00:13.070> of

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
3 and this part going to cover some of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.390 
3 and this part going to cover some of
the<00:00:13.250> basic<00:00:13.580> mechanics<00:00:14.949> first<00:00:15.949> of<00:00:16.129> all<00:00:16.219> we're

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
the basic mechanics first of all we're

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.420 
the basic mechanics first of all we're
going<00:00:16.520> to<00:00:16.610> discuss<00:00:16.940> actions<00:00:17.859> at<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.070> start<00:00:19.340> of

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
going to discuss actions at the start of

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.530 
going to discuss actions at the start of
you<00:00:19.550> turn<00:00:19.760> you<00:00:20.120> given<00:00:20.390> five<00:00:20.720> action<00:00:21.380> tokens

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
you turn you given five action tokens

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.970 
you turn you given five action tokens
that<00:00:23.540> basically<00:00:23.960> means<00:00:24.260> that<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:24.620> can<00:00:24.800> do

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
that basically means that you can do

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.210 
that basically means that you can do
five<00:00:25.430> things<00:00:25.460> that<00:00:26.240> turn<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:27.590> can<00:00:27.770> only<00:00:27.860> spend

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
five things that turn you can only spend

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.640 
five things that turn you can only spend
up<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.490> two<00:00:28.880> on<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.240> kneeboard<00:00:29.780> player<00:00:30.320> and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
up to two on a kneeboard player and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.090 
up to two on a kneeboard player and
since<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:31.730> have<00:00:31.880> six<00:00:32.239> players<00:00:32.599> usually<00:00:33.500> on

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
since you have six players usually on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.520 
since you have six players usually on
the<00:00:34.399> board<00:00:34.640> at<00:00:34.789> any<00:00:34.910> given<00:00:35.120> time<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:36.290> means

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
the board at any given time that means

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.500 
the board at any given time that means
somebody<00:00:37.100> probably<00:00:38.000> isn't<00:00:38.180> going<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.360> be<00:00:38.450> able

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
somebody probably isn't going to be able

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.240 
somebody probably isn't going to be able
to<00:00:38.750> do<00:00:38.870> anything<00:00:39.110> that<00:00:39.410> turn<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.070> have<00:00:40.160> to

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
to do anything that turn so you have to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.680 
to do anything that turn so you have to
think<00:00:40.430> very<00:00:40.550> carefully<00:00:40.820> about<00:00:41.150> who<00:00:41.480> you're

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
think very carefully about who you're

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.229 
think very carefully about who you're
spending<00:00:41.870> your<00:00:42.260> actions<00:00:42.620> on<00:00:42.940> there<00:00:43.940> are<00:00:44.030> ways

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
spending your actions on there are ways

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.900 
spending your actions on there are ways
to<00:00:44.480> generate<00:00:44.630> more<00:00:45.260> actions<00:00:45.860> or<00:00:46.220> three

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
to generate more actions or three

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.319 
to generate more actions or three
actions<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.020> we'll<00:00:48.110> come<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.320> those<00:00:48.590> later

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
actions but we'll come to those later

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.819 
actions but we'll come to those later
unless<00:00:50.329> is<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.600> two<00:00:50.750> powers<00:00:51.020> of<00:00:51.230> three<00:00:51.559> dice

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
unless is the two powers of three dice

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.510 
unless is the two powers of three dice
here<00:00:52.130> this<00:00:53.059> is<00:00:53.180> because<00:00:53.649> most<00:00:54.649> things<00:00:55.280> that

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
here this is because most things that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.819 
here this is because most things that
you'll<00:00:55.670> want<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.940> do<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.750> game<00:00:56.960> require<00:00:57.800> a

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
you'll want to do in the game require a

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.260 
you'll want to do in the game require a
test<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.610> usually<00:00:59.390> starts<00:00:59.690> on<00:00:59.989> three<00:01:00.260> dice

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
test that usually starts on three dice

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.420 
test that usually starts on three dice
some<00:01:02.270> people<00:01:02.750> get<00:01:02.930> more<00:01:03.170> dice<00:01:03.469> for<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.009> tests

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
some people get more dice for the tests

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.920 
some people get more dice for the tests
depending<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:05.239> it's<00:01:05.360> something<00:01:05.750> that

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
depending on if it's something that

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.520 
depending on if it's something that
specialized<00:01:06.469> at<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:07.520> example<00:01:07.549> a<00:01:08.119> striker

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
specialized at for example a striker

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.219 
specialized at for example a striker
picking<00:01:09.530> all<00:01:09.799> up<00:01:10.329> they're<00:01:11.329> very<00:01:11.569> skilled<00:01:11.990> at

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
picking all up they're very skilled at

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.129 
picking all up they're very skilled at
that<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:12.740> they<00:01:12.889> would<00:01:13.039> get<00:01:13.219> an<00:01:13.659> extra<00:01:14.659> dice<00:01:14.840> for

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:15.139 
that so they would get an extra dice for

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.370 
that so they would get an extra dice for
that<00:01:15.259> test<00:01:16.090> there<00:01:17.090> are<00:01:17.119> ways<00:01:17.389> to<00:01:17.420> lose<00:01:17.810> dice<00:01:18.170> as

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
that test there are ways to lose dice as

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.050 
that test there are ways to lose dice as
well<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:18.889> example<00:01:18.950> if<00:01:19.549> you're<00:01:19.670> doing<00:01:19.939> it

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
well for example if you're doing it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.300 
well for example if you're doing it
right<00:01:20.299> next<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:20.719> an<00:01:20.810> enemy<00:01:20.959> player<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:22.159> may

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
right next to an enemy player you may

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.999 
right next to an enemy player you may
lose<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.579> dice<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:24.020> represent<00:01:24.499> it<00:01:24.590> being<00:01:24.799> more

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
lose a dice to represent it being more

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.739 
lose a dice to represent it being more
difficult<00:01:25.159> with<00:01:25.609> somebody<00:01:25.939> right<00:01:26.149> there<00:01:26.209> and

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
difficult with somebody right there and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.489 
difficult with somebody right there and
to<00:01:27.649> determine<00:01:28.100> whether<00:01:28.249> you<00:01:28.399> succeed<00:01:28.639> or<00:01:28.969> not

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
to determine whether you succeed or not

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.199 
to determine whether you succeed or not
you'll<00:01:30.499> find<00:01:30.829> that<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.159> players<00:01:31.459> have<00:01:31.789> stats

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
you'll find that you players have stats

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.569 
you'll find that you players have stats
for<00:01:33.170> example<00:01:33.709> speed<00:01:34.700> 4<00:01:35.539> +<00:01:36.069> this<00:01:37.069> means<00:01:37.369> that

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
for example speed 4 + this means that

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.089 
for example speed 4 + this means that
when<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:37.849> need<00:01:37.999> to<00:01:38.149> take<00:01:38.329> a<00:01:38.359> speed<00:01:38.779> test<00:01:39.139> you

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
when you need to take a speed test you

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.260 
when you need to take a speed test you
need<00:01:40.249> to<00:01:40.399> achieve<00:01:40.490> 1<00:01:41.060> 4<00:01:41.479> +<00:01:41.779> on<00:01:42.139> the<00:01:42.859> dice<00:01:43.039> so<00:01:44.029> for

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
need to achieve 1 4 + on the dice so for

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.029 
need to achieve 1 4 + on the dice so for
example<00:01:44.689> if<00:01:44.779> I<00:01:44.899> roll<00:01:45.109> these<00:01:45.259> three<00:01:45.560> days

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
example if I roll these three days

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.800 
example if I roll these three days
I<00:01:46.299> got<00:01:47.299> 1/4<00:01:47.779> +<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.469> that<00:01:48.619> would<00:01:48.740> be<00:01:48.859> a<00:01:48.889> success

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
I got 1/4 + so that would be a success

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.510 
I got 1/4 + so that would be a success
so<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:50.869> can<00:01:51.020> see<00:01:51.200> we're<00:01:51.349> having<00:01:51.439> more<00:01:51.829> dice<00:01:52.130> is

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
so you can see we're having more dice is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.359 
so you can see we're having more dice is
beneficial<00:01:53.349> with<00:01:54.349> quest<00:01:54.619> view<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.919> tests

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
beneficial with quest view the tests

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.399 
beneficial with quest view the tests
there<00:01:55.579> are<00:01:55.700> benefits<00:01:56.209> to<00:01:56.419> doubling<00:01:57.049> the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
there are benefits to doubling the

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.889 
there are benefits to doubling the
required<00:01:57.799> success<00:01:58.399> for<00:01:59.119> example<00:01:59.539> if<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.779> had

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
required success for example if I had

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.209 
required success for example if I had
rolled<00:02:00.139> a<00:02:00.499> 4<00:02:01.069> and<00:02:01.459> a<00:02:02.149> 5<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:03.590> would<00:02:03.739> be<00:02:03.889> twice

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
rolled a 4 and a 5 that would be twice

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.949 
rolled a 4 and a 5 that would be twice
the<00:02:04.579> amount<00:02:04.639> that<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:05.060> needed<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.630> there<00:02:05.779> may<00:02:05.929> be

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
the amount that I needed so there may be

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.380 
the amount that I needed so there may be
a<00:02:06.109> bonus<00:02:06.619> associated<00:02:07.340> with<00:02:07.489> that<00:02:07.609> in<00:02:07.880> some

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
a bonus associated with that in some

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.389 
a bonus associated with that in some
cases<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.899> might<00:02:09.050> be<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> free<00:02:09.679> action<00:02:09.890> for<00:02:10.310> that

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
cases it might be a free action for that

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.120 
cases it might be a free action for that
player<00:02:10.810> when<00:02:11.810> making<00:02:12.020> an<00:02:12.260> opposed<00:02:12.590> check

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
player when making an opposed check

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.400 
player when making an opposed check
against<00:02:13.580> each<00:02:13.700> other<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.270> example<00:02:14.960> one<00:02:15.260> of

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
against each other for example one of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.290 
against each other for example one of
these<00:02:15.590> players<00:02:15.950> slammed<00:02:16.610> into<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.120> other

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
these players slammed into the other

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.190 
these players slammed into the other
you<00:02:18.260> would<00:02:18.410> roll<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.800> dice<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:20.240> whoever

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
you would roll the dice and then whoever

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.900 
you would roll the dice and then whoever
had<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.440> most<00:02:21.620> successes<00:02:22.370> would<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
had the most successes would be the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.290 
had the most successes would be the
winner<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.890> again<00:02:24.890> there<00:02:25.250> are<00:02:25.280> bonuses<00:02:26.060> if

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
winner and again there are bonuses if

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.050 
winner and again there are bonuses if
you<00:02:26.450> double<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:28.100> if<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.370> get<00:02:28.580> double<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
you double so if you get double the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.110 
you double so if you get double the
score<00:02:29.420> your<00:02:29.630> opponent<00:02:30.110> does<00:02:30.880> something<00:02:31.880> good

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
score your opponent does something good

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.080 
score your opponent does something good
is<00:02:32.330> going<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.510> happen<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:34.310> case<00:02:34.460> of<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.760> slum

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
is going to happen in the case of a slum

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.540 
is going to happen in the case of a slum
it<00:02:35.660> would<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:36.050> pushing<00:02:36.800> your<00:02:36.920> opponent<00:02:37.370> back

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
it would be pushing your opponent back

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.140 
it would be pushing your opponent back
knocking<00:02:37.970> him<00:02:38.180> over<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.780> maybe<00:02:39.230> injuring<00:02:39.830> him

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
knocking him over and maybe injuring him

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.190 
knocking him over and maybe injuring him
so<00:02:41.150> I'm<00:02:41.300> going<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.480> play<00:02:41.660> out<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.840> couple<00:02:42.140> of

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
so I'm going to play out a couple of

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.640 
so I'm going to play out a couple of
examples<00:02:42.740> here<00:02:42.970> let's<00:02:43.970> say<00:02:44.180> for<00:02:44.420> example<00:02:44.650> this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
examples here let's say for example this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.250 
examples here let's say for example this
guard<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.610> guard<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.480> going<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> slam<00:02:48.050> into

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
guard this guard is going to slam into

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.580 
guard this guard is going to slam into
the<00:02:48.470> cooperation<00:02:48.890> guard<00:02:49.340> here<00:02:50.200> they'll<00:02:51.200> start

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
the cooperation guard here they'll start

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.420 
the cooperation guard here they'll start
off<00:02:51.800> with<00:02:52.100> three<00:02:52.430> days<00:02:54.250> however<00:02:55.250> because

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
off with three days however because

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.270 
off with three days however because
their<00:02:55.730> guards<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.620> slamming<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.830> right<00:02:58.070> up

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
their guards and slamming is right up

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.520 
their guards and slamming is right up
their<00:02:58.460> alley<00:02:58.810> they'll<00:02:59.810> get<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.020> bonus<00:03:00.260> dice

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
their alley they'll get a bonus dice

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.850 
their alley they'll get a bonus dice
also<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:05.210> ock<00:03:05.510> will<00:03:06.020> get<00:03:06.170> another<00:03:06.440> bonus

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
also this ock will get another bonus

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.610 
also this ock will get another bonus
because<00:03:07.070> he<00:03:07.370> moved<00:03:07.670> into<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.240> slum<00:03:08.620> to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
because he moved into the slum to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.040 
because he moved into the slum to
represent<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.160> extra<00:03:10.490> momentum<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.930> this

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
represent the extra momentum so in this

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.650 
represent the extra momentum so in this
case<00:03:12.260> with<00:03:12.530> five<00:03:12.770> dice<00:03:13.100> against<00:03:13.520> four<00:03:13.790> so

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
case with five dice against four so

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.180 
case with five dice against four so
let's<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:15.140> what<00:03:15.260> they<00:03:15.350> come<00:03:15.530> up<00:03:15.560> with

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.520 

slumming<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.750> strength-based<00:03:23.750> test<00:03:24.200> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
slumming is a strength-based test and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.130 
slumming is a strength-based test and
the<00:03:25.340> old<00:03:25.489> guard<00:03:25.760> has<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> strength<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.780> three

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
the old guard has a strength of three

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.040 
the old guard has a strength of three
plus<00:03:27.520> so<00:03:28.520> we<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.820> see<00:03:29.030> he's<00:03:29.270> got<00:03:29.450> three

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
plus so we can see he's got three

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.330 
plus so we can see he's got three
successes<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.489> five<00:03:31.700> dice<00:03:33.340> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
successes of the five dice the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.340 
successes of the five dice the
cooperation<00:03:34.820> guard<00:03:35.239> isn't<00:03:35.450> quite<00:03:35.810> as<00:03:36.020> strong

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
cooperation guard isn't quite as strong

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.570 
cooperation guard isn't quite as strong
so<00:03:36.680> he<00:03:36.950> needs<00:03:37.160> four<00:03:37.520> pluses<00:03:40.120> he<00:03:41.120> has<00:03:41.270> to<00:03:42.580> but

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
so he needs four pluses he has to but

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.250 
so he needs four pluses he has to but
this<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:43.970> very<00:03:44.180> opportune<00:03:44.660> time<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:44.959> tell

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
this is a very opportune time to tell

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.380 
this is a very opportune time to tell
you<00:03:45.350> about<00:03:45.440> something<00:03:45.800> else

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
you about something else

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.479 
you about something else
exploding<00:03:47.390> sixes<00:03:48.010> every<00:03:49.010> time<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.310> roll<00:03:49.430> a

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
exploding sixes every time you roll a

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.790 
exploding sixes every time you roll a
six<00:03:49.820> in<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.030> test<00:03:50.300> that<00:03:50.720> counts<00:03:51.140> as<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> success

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
six in a test that counts as a success

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.729 
six in a test that counts as a success
and<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:53.239> roll<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.510> again<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.260> try<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.620> get

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
and you roll it again and try and get

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.110 
and you roll it again and try and get
another<00:03:56.500> but<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.680> failed<00:03:57.950> but<00:03:58.610> let's<00:03:58.940> just

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
another but that failed but let's just

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.330 
another but that failed but let's just
say<00:03:59.300> I<00:03:59.330> rolled<00:03:59.660> another<00:03:59.930> six<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.590> could<00:04:01.160> keep

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
say I rolled another six I could keep

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.550 
say I rolled another six I could keep
going<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.330> on<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.570> on<00:04:02.630> until<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:03.140> stopped

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
going on and on and on until I stopped

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.670 
going on and on and on until I stopped
rolling<00:04:03.770> sixes<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:05.510> even<00:04:05.780> if<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.930> test<00:04:06.140> seems

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
rolling sixes so even if a test seems

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.890 
rolling sixes so even if a test seems
like<00:04:07.070> it's<00:04:07.310> impossible<00:04:07.720> because<00:04:08.720> you're

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
like it's impossible because you're

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.750 
like it's impossible because you're
horribly<00:04:09.320> outmatched<00:04:09.770> just<00:04:10.430> by<00:04:10.580> rolling

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
horribly outmatched just by rolling

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.630 
horribly outmatched just by rolling
sixes<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.450> can<00:04:11.810> still<00:04:12.050> come<00:04:12.260> out<00:04:12.320> on<00:04:12.530> top<00:04:12.739> now

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
sixes you can still come out on top now

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.070 
sixes you can still come out on top now
an<00:04:13.790> example<00:04:14.060> we're<00:04:14.330> doing<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.660> cooperation

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
an example we're doing the cooperation

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.150 
an example we're doing the cooperation
guard<00:04:15.489> had<00:04:16.489> two<00:04:16.880> successes<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:18.620> orc<00:04:18.890> had

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
guard had two successes the orc had

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.759 
guard had two successes the orc had
three<00:04:19.690> that<00:04:20.690> means<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.109> OP<00:04:21.230> wins

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
three that means the OP wins

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.909 
three that means the OP wins
he<00:04:22.580> hasn't<00:04:22.730> doubled<00:04:23.300> him<00:04:23.480> though<00:04:23.900> so<00:04:24.710> all<00:04:24.890> he

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
he hasn't doubled him though so all he

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.270 
he hasn't doubled him though so all he
can<00:04:25.040> do<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.610> push<00:04:26.300> him<00:04:26.479> back<00:04:26.890> he's<00:04:27.890> gonna<00:04:27.979> push

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
can do is push him back he's gonna push

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.500 
can do is push him back he's gonna push
him<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.550> there

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
him to there

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.880 
him to there
and<00:04:29.630> then<00:04:29.750> he<00:04:29.840> has<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.080> option<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.590> whether<00:04:30.740> he

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
and then he has the option of whether he

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.950 
and then he has the option of whether he
wants<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.220> follow<00:04:31.370> up<00:04:31.640> into<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.360> hex<00:04:32.660> there

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
wants to follow up into that hex there

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
wants to follow up into that hex there
which<00:04:33.560> he<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.800> going<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.190> do<00:04:34.340> no<00:04:35.210> hurt<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.800> orc

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
which he is going to do no hurt the orc

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.560 
which he is going to do no hurt the orc
got<00:04:37.880> four<00:04:38.270> successes<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:40.760> other<00:04:40.910> guards<00:04:41.240> -

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
got four successes to the other guards -

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.890 
got four successes to the other guards -
that<00:04:42.200> would<00:04:42.320> have<00:04:42.380> been<00:04:42.530> double<00:04:43.450> so<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.570> bonus

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
that would have been double so the bonus

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.480 
that would have been double so the bonus
for<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.140> beam<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:45.530> could<00:04:45.680> push<00:04:45.860> him<00:04:46.010> back<00:04:46.220> and

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
for the beam you could push him back and

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.380 
for the beam you could push him back and
knock<00:04:47.420> him<00:04:47.600> down<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:51.680> this<00:04:52.580> situation<00:04:53.210> the

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
knock him down in this situation the

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.840 
knock him down in this situation the
guard<00:04:53.630> would<00:04:53.960> then<00:04:54.200> take<00:04:54.530> however<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.220> dice<00:04:55.610> he

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
guard would then take however a dice he

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.720 
guard would then take however a dice he
lost<00:04:56.120> by<00:04:56.390> which<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.260> two<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.800> that<00:04:58.400> would<00:04:58.550> be

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
lost by which is two and that would be

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.850 
lost by which is two and that would be
how<00:04:58.850> many<00:04:58.910> turns<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.780> he<00:04:59.930> has<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.230> spend<00:05:00.500> off

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
how many turns that he has to spend off

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.970 
how many turns that he has to spend off
in<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.280> sin<00:05:01.490> bin<00:05:01.780> unless<00:05:02.780> he<00:05:03.350> can<00:05:03.530> pass<00:05:03.740> some

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
in the sin bin unless he can pass some

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.530 
in the sin bin unless he can pass some
armor<00:05:04.310> tests<00:05:04.790> so<00:05:05.630> let's<00:05:06.620> roll<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.880> guards<00:05:08.300> are

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
armor tests so let's roll the guards are

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.200 
armor tests so let's roll the guards are
the<00:05:08.690> tests<00:05:09.160> again<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.400> start<00:05:10.790> with<00:05:10.850> three

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
the tests again you start with three

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.510 
the tests again you start with three
typically<00:05:11.690> for<00:05:11.900> everybody<00:05:12.260> but<00:05:13.070> since<00:05:13.340> he's<00:05:13.490> a

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
typically for everybody but since he's a

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.010 
typically for everybody but since he's a
guards<00:05:13.970> there<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.240> extra<00:05:14.510> tough<00:05:14.720> players

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
guards there the extra tough players

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.650 
guards there the extra tough players
they<00:05:15.350> would<00:05:15.470> get<00:05:15.620> another<00:05:15.890> one<00:05:16.130> just<00:05:16.660> boosting

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
they would get another one just boosting

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.710 
they would get another one just boosting
their<00:05:17.780> chances<00:05:18.200> of<00:05:18.260> success<00:05:18.970> very<00:05:19.970> success<00:05:20.480> on

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
their chances of success very success on

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.930 
their chances of success very success on
this<00:05:20.870> roll<00:05:21.140> that's<00:05:22.130> going<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.370> reduce<00:05:22.520> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
this roll that's going to reduce the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.490 
this roll that's going to reduce the
turn<00:05:23.150> that<00:05:23.330> he<00:05:23.390> spends<00:05:23.750> on<00:05:23.840> injured<00:05:24.230> by<00:05:24.410> one<00:05:26.500> so

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
turn that he spends on injured by one so

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.590 
turn that he spends on injured by one so
he's<00:05:27.950> going<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.250> be<00:05:28.340> completely<00:05:28.700> fine<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.270> don't

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
he's going to be completely fine I don't

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.450 
he's going to be completely fine I don't
even<00:05:29.750> need<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.200> roll<00:05:30.350> those<00:05:30.500> exploding<00:05:30.890> sexes

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
even need to roll those exploding sexes

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.220 
even need to roll those exploding sexes
because<00:05:31.610> I've<00:05:31.910> already<00:05:32.060> got<00:05:32.180> as<00:05:32.600> much<00:05:32.960> as<00:05:33.110> I

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
because I've already got as much as I

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.190 
because I've already got as much as I
can<00:05:33.440> now<00:05:33.710> he's<00:05:34.460> still<00:05:34.610> going<00:05:34.790> to<00:05:34.820> be<00:05:34.880> down<00:05:35.200> but

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
can now he's still going to be down but

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.010 
can now he's still going to be down but
he's<00:05:36.380> not<00:05:36.560> off<00:05:36.860> that<00:05:37.190> board<00:05:37.460> another<00:05:38.450> example

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
he's not off that board another example

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.620 
he's not off that board another example
of<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.170> test<00:05:39.440> this<00:05:39.980> striker<00:05:40.490> here<00:05:40.910> he's<00:05:41.330> going

move five as the basic movement that's

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.490 
move five as the basic movement that's
pretty<00:05:47.510> much<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.810> same<00:05:47.990> for<00:05:48.230> all<00:05:48.320> these

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
action tokens and it doesn't count

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.230 
action tokens and it doesn't count
towards<00:06:34.010> the<00:06:34.070> amount<00:06:34.400> of<00:06:34.490> actions<00:06:34.910> that<00:06:35.090> he

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
towards the amount of actions that he

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.060 
towards the amount of actions that he
can<00:06:35.390> take<00:06:35.570> in<00:06:35.750> a<00:06:35.780> turn<00:06:36.020> so<00:06:36.620> he<00:06:36.770> can<00:06:36.950> now

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
can take in a turn so he can now

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.920 
can take in a turn so he can now
potentially<00:06:37.610> get<00:06:37.760> three<00:06:38.090> actions<00:06:38.540> in<00:06:38.720> one

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
potentially get three actions in one

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.519 
potentially get three actions in one
turn<00:06:39.170> had<00:06:40.010> he<00:06:40.160> failed<00:06:40.610> to<00:06:41.210> pick

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:41.529 
turn had he failed to pick

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.169 
turn had he failed to pick
all<00:06:41.619> up<00:06:42.069> utterly<00:06:44.099> rolling<00:06:45.099> nothing<00:06:45.759> but<00:06:45.969> low

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:46.179 
all up utterly rolling nothing but low

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:50.039 
all up utterly rolling nothing but low
numbers<00:06:46.679> then<00:06:47.679> the<00:06:48.069> ball<00:06:48.249> would<00:06:48.429> scatter<00:06:49.049> so

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:50.049 
numbers then the ball would scatter so

00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:51.269 
numbers then the ball would scatter so
I'm<00:06:50.109> going<00:06:50.259> to<00:06:50.319> show<00:06:50.439> you<00:06:50.469> how<00:06:50.649> that<00:06:50.829> works<00:06:50.979> now

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:51.279 
I'm going to show you how that works now

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.309 
I'm going to show you how that works now
you<00:06:51.879> need<00:06:52.029> one<00:06:52.239> dice<00:06:52.509> to<00:06:52.719> scatter<00:06:52.989> the<00:06:53.169> ball

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
you need one dice to scatter the ball

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.709 
you need one dice to scatter the ball
it's<00:06:53.559> very<00:06:53.769> simple<00:06:54.159> because<00:06:54.669> obviously<00:06:55.179> with

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
it's very simple because obviously with

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.169 
it's very simple because obviously with
a<00:06:55.749> hex<00:06:56.019> system<00:06:56.589> there<00:06:57.189> are<00:06:57.219> six<00:06:57.609> hexes

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:58.179 
a hex system there are six hexes

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:00.689 
a hex system there are six hexes
surrounding<00:06:58.839> him<00:06:59.069> one<00:07:00.069> being

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
surrounding him one being

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.149 
surrounding him one being
straightforward<00:07:01.119> and<00:07:01.779> then<00:07:02.499> you<00:07:02.649> work<00:07:02.859> round

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.159 
straightforward and then you work round

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:08.339 
straightforward and then you work round
in<00:07:03.369> a<00:07:03.459> clockwise<00:07:03.699> manner<00:07:04.409> so<00:07:05.819> four<00:07:06.839> one<00:07:07.839> two

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.349 
in a clockwise manner so four one two

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:11.009 
in a clockwise manner so four one two
three<00:07:08.649> four<00:07:09.359> it's<00:07:10.359> going<00:07:10.539> to<00:07:10.599> give<00:07:10.749> straight

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:11.019 
three four it's going to give straight

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:12.779 
three four it's going to give straight
behind<00:07:11.379> in<00:07:11.589> and<00:07:11.769> then<00:07:12.189> you<00:07:12.279> rolled<00:07:12.489> see<00:07:12.729> how

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
behind in and then you rolled see how

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:21.479 
behind in and then you rolled see how
far<00:07:12.969> it<00:07:13.119> goes<00:07:13.269> 1<00:07:13.599> days<00:07:13.839> 2<00:07:16.169> so<00:07:17.669> 1<00:07:18.669> 2<00:07:19.289> in<00:07:20.489> a

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:21.489 
far it goes 1 days 2 so 1 2 in a

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:23.069 
far it goes 1 days 2 so 1 2 in a
situation<00:07:21.999> like<00:07:22.119> that<00:07:22.179> where<00:07:22.419> you<00:07:22.779> lose

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:23.079 
situation like that where you lose

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:26.369 
situation like that where you lose
control<00:07:23.739> of<00:07:23.769> the<00:07:24.039> ball<00:07:24.539> that<00:07:25.539> automatically

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:26.379 
control of the ball that automatically

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.379 
control of the ball that automatically
ends<00:07:26.919> your<00:07:27.159> turn<00:07:27.399> regardless<00:07:28.089> of<00:07:28.209> how<00:07:28.329> many

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:28.389 
ends your turn regardless of how many

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.619 
ends your turn regardless of how many
action<00:07:28.869> tokens<00:07:29.289> you<00:07:29.439> have<00:07:29.589> left<00:07:29.859> so<00:07:30.449> if<00:07:31.449> you're

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:31.629 
action tokens you have left so if you're

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.979 
action tokens you have left so if you're
going<00:07:31.929> to<00:07:32.019> for<00:07:32.229> some<00:07:32.439> risky<00:07:32.829> ball<00:07:33.099> handling

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:33.989 
going to for some risky ball handling

00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:36.629 
going to for some risky ball handling
you<00:07:34.989> better<00:07:35.289> off<00:07:35.529> getting<00:07:35.799> your<00:07:36.069> players<00:07:36.279> into

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 
you better off getting your players into

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.789 
you better off getting your players into
position<00:07:37.089> and<00:07:37.269> knowing<00:07:37.599> slow<00:07:37.899> actions<00:07:38.379> first

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:38.799 
position and knowing slow actions first

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:41.519 
position and knowing slow actions first
before<00:07:39.339> you<00:07:39.819> go<00:07:39.969> for<00:07:40.149> the<00:07:40.209> ball<00:07:40.529> that

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:41.529 
before you go for the ball that

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:44.519 
before you go for the ball that
concludes<00:07:42.099> the<00:07:42.399> basic<00:07:42.909> mechanics<00:07:43.379> next<00:07:44.379> time

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:44.529 
concludes the basic mechanics next time

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:45.539 
concludes the basic mechanics next time
we're<00:07:44.649> going<00:07:44.769> to<00:07:44.829> go<00:07:44.979> with<00:07:45.129> the<00:07:45.249> different

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:45.549 
we're going to go with the different

00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:48.929 
we're going to go with the different
kinds<00:07:45.849> of<00:07:45.909> player<00:07:46.209> movements
