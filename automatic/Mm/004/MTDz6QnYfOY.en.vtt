00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.140
 we are continuing the facebook series 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 with smoking 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello friends how are you here with you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.960
 here is gaming bringing you chapter 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.430
 number 44 it seems to me and we go 2 to about 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.430
 Gentlemen we are winning everything that just 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720
 be the series but this thanks for 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.369
 have me here thank you for the invitation 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.169
 let's see what's up if you're 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.349
 liking the series we will try to 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:35.400
 win like this is let's try this to go 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.110
 ok let's go level between that 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.640
 we are winning and we are losing but 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.480
 well little by little this and this one against 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 who touched us 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.300
 but I say by the level that you see that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.370
 have hopefully they are nuts we need 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 winning is a deathmatch team they are not going to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 going out a lot is going to stay in your corner 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 but I hope we do well 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 well, let's hope they are not 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.010
 franking or at least that is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.780
 campean do not play as tactical as not 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.520
 everyone says ok then we got it 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.740
 in this map what is it called 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.740
 vortex I think yes sport 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.630
 well, let's see what 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.320
 because my subjects for the truth I do not know 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.990
 it gives a lot 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.350
 I get very confused a lot because 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.840
 how many plants are and if you are 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.460
 a little confusing but good 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.440
 producing producers but you are going to 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.660
 see what you achieve I do not see anyone 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.850
 yes today when I raise this chapter 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.830
 You have to see how they killed me in the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.790
 first time in front of him he has it in front 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.790
 in the low 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.420
 more than one behind me there are others 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 behind me and I do not know how I managed 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.750
 hide 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.190
 that is the attitude you know what happens 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.860
 already changing the sensitivity go or 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.090
 do not 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.310
 right now that's a very good sin 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.480
 very good very well 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.090
 let's get freedom let's take the advantage 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.900
 so as not to be suffering in the end 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.900
 I do not see anyone 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.500
 there they are there is one for the scarecrow 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.630
 or is totally the opposite of where 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.630
 are we ok 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.640
 let's see how this map is all 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.640
 as very technical 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.510
 this is going to help everyone 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.740
 only one walks what's his face 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.540
 ready and put short 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.940
 how fast I run out of bullet whore what 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.000
 loser am 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.680
 and not when you see my first death 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.680
 you are going to pee with laughter 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.069
 all that bastard 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.129
 until there we need on the map a 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.189
 less than perfect time in front of 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.189
 you 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.340
 died how many there are one or two saints what 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.980
 what happens is that one is super as 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.980
 we said that he would be champion 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.000
 and well we do not have any other we have to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.800
 deal with a situation but 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.700
 if we beat them it is much more pleasant 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.700
 beat them 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.770
 Now nobody saw no one 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.819
 and behind me it can not be that they respond 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.819
 bad or death 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.280
 there is 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.300
 or is that very little girl have their 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:07.810
 Scullion 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:07.810
 its August bows where here in the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:17.060
 this 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:18.959
 that's so that nothing noise is that of the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.209
 silence no 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.010
 I do not say that the radars do not 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.630
 you have not detected 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.630
 There are other 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:36.560
 good and clean that's what that garbage is called 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:44.900
 but it's the classic that you kill him and you 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.900
 throw the grenade to finish 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.570
 gentlemen every time we must say that they have 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.790
 been dominated 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.790
 Yes 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.090
 let's win what happens there I had to 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.450
 be where you are where they are 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.450
 the bushes 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.139
 I do not see it happening the front is 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.489
 opposite as well as mocking the 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.739
 individual 

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:25.939
 it also starts to shoot between them 

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.939
 they pay with their life 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:41.969
 somehow but we do not 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.399
 we have time to be losing ourselves 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.869
 We dedicate to grab the most amount of 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:48.599
 money possible 

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:56.249
 So grabbing houses like you say 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:58.699
 also look back thank you thank you are 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.699
 my Goddess 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.370
 ok ok there we go 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.390
 to see if it does not kill me and what imbecile 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.520
 single 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.190
 Look, that's classic and I'm always 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.950
 it happens to me so physical 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.330
 I could not miss the hazing of the day like this 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:21.069
 is yes hazing no days 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:23.050
 they took me out and I think they have to be 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.759
 saying everyone who playing with the 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.759
 most gay weapons in the world but good 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:38.090
 and how good you have to see that not 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:42.920
 It stains the good range that comes to me and 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:46.610
 low I say yes because they hire you 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.850
 they hire him, hey, it was really good 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.560
 the game if they are not there was nothing of 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.750
 competition and with this we get a 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.150
 record of 3 to 1 I think we're doing fine not 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.760
 so it's good then I wish you liked it 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.300
 this game is how to see us was 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.760
 pretty good or you what do you think motorbike 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.470
 perfect to ask for mouth like that is something more 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.450
