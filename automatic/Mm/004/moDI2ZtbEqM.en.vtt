blocked tear ducts or Decorah stenosis

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
blocked tear ducts or Decorah stenosis
is<00:00:17.010> where<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.150> tear<00:00:18.510> duct

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
is where the tear duct

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.330 
is where the tear duct
typically<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> inner<00:00:19.560> corner<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> eye

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
typically the inner corner of the eye

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.450 
typically the inner corner of the eye
that<00:00:20.430> actually<00:00:21.119> drains<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> nose<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
that actually drains into the nose in a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.509 
that actually drains into the nose in a
newborn<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.269> very<00:00:24.960> often<00:00:25.320> blocked<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.010> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
newborn is very often blocked and so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.419 
newborn is very often blocked and so
once<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:27.510> start<00:00:27.810> making<00:00:27.960> tears<00:00:28.529> those<00:00:29.160> tears

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
once they start making tears those tears

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
once they start making tears those tears
are<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.060> through<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.390> nose<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.810> down

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
are not going through the nose and down

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.299 
are not going through the nose and down
the<00:00:31.109> back<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> throat<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.949> they<00:00:32.130> would

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the back of the throat like they would

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.030 
the back of the throat like they would
for<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.719> they're<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.110> weeping

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
for you and I but they're just weeping

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880 
for you and I but they're just weeping
tearing<00:00:35.760> eyes<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> process

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
tearing eyes and I think in the process

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.119 
tearing eyes and I think in the process
of<00:00:38.309> rubbing<00:00:38.899> eyes<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.590> sometimes<00:00:40.980> get

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
of rubbing eyes can sometimes get

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
of rubbing eyes can sometimes get
infected<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.570> even<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:42.870> they're<00:00:43.020> not

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
infected but even if they're not

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.930 
infected but even if they're not
infected<00:00:43.860> you'll<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.280> sort<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.700> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
infected you'll just sort of have this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.500 
infected you'll just sort of have this
Sheen<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.079> mucus<00:00:46.559> II<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> lot<00:00:48.149> it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
Sheen or this mucus II not a lot it's

child in sooner we can probe the tear

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
child in sooner we can probe the tear
duct<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> work<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.670> frankly<00:01:17.670> in

duct and make it work right frankly in
my<00:01:18.320> 20-some<00:01:19.320> years<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.770> Pediatrics<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.549> have

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
my 20-some years of Pediatrics I have

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
my 20-some years of Pediatrics I have
never<00:01:21.630> had<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.500> child<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.189> their

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
never had to have a child have their

never had to have a child have their

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
tear duct probed or putting in a little

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.140 
tear duct probed or putting in a little
stent<00:01:26.310> which<00:01:26.520> sometimes<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
stent which sometimes the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.600 
stent which sometimes the
ophthalmologist<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> simple

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
ophthalmologist will do for a simple

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
ophthalmologist will do for a simple
block<00:01:30.420> tear<00:01:30.720> duct<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.259> otherwise

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
block tear duct that's not otherwise

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.499 
block tear duct that's not otherwise
causing<00:01:32.130> any<00:01:32.250> problems<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.360> my

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
causing any problems so my

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
causing any problems so my
recommendation<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.350> don't<00:01:34.619> rush<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.100> get

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
recommendation is don't rush off and get

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.010 
recommendation is don't rush off and get
yourself<00:01:35.549> surgery<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> problem<00:01:36.810> that's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
yourself surgery for a problem that's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.399 
yourself surgery for a problem that's
resolving<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.710> its<00:01:37.890> own<00:01:38.040> anyway<00:01:38.479> for<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.509> 1%

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
resolving on its own anyway for that 1%

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.789 
resolving on its own anyway for that 1%
or<00:01:40.590> 1<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> 5%<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:42.000> infants<00:01:42.600> who<00:01:42.750> reach<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.470> year

this<00:02:20.520> sounds<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.850> little<00:02:20.880> odd<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.180> mom<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.720> can

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
this sounds a little odd but mom you can

and<00:02:30.600> forth<00:02:31.020> but<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.290> certainly<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.860> harmless<00:02:32.220> I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
and forth but it certainly is harmless I

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.970 
and forth but it certainly is harmless I
have<00:02:32.700> had<00:02:32.970> hundreds<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.690> moms<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
have had hundreds of moms do this and it

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.580 
have had hundreds of moms do this and it
seems<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.460> it<00:02:35.640> works<00:02:35.880> every<00:02:36.450> time<00:02:36.720> this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
seems like it works every time this
