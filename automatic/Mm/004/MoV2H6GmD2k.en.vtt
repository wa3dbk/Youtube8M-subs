ipod touch version of doom and the
reason<00:02:29.220> i<00:02:29.370> put<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.610> at<00:02:29.760> number<00:02:29.940> 4<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.180> because

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
reason i put this at number 4 is because

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.059 
reason i put this at number 4 is because
i'm<00:02:30.510> not<00:02:30.630> particularly<00:02:31.140> found<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> control

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
i'm not particularly found the control

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.399 
i'm not particularly found the control
system<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.540> do<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> choice<00:02:34.020> of

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
system on this you do have a choice of

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.050 
system on this you do have a choice of
interfaces<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.099> pick<00:02:35.370> from<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.819> one<00:02:35.970> i'm

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
interfaces to pick from and the one i'm

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.220 
interfaces to pick from and the one i'm
using<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.629> one<00:02:36.780> I'm<00:02:36.900> most<00:02:36.930> comfortable

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
using is the one I'm most comfortable

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
using is the one I'm most comfortable
with<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.099> can

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
with but as you can

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.930 
with but as you can
see<00:02:38.770> it's<00:02:39.770> well<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.370> don't<00:02:40.459> know<00:02:40.610> if<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.760> can

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
see it's well I don't know if you can

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.520 
see it's well I don't know if you can
see<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:41.209> it's<00:02:41.300> incredibly<00:02:41.900> difficult<00:02:42.110> to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
see but it's incredibly difficult to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.110 
see but it's incredibly difficult to
maneuver<00:02:42.920> around<00:02:42.950> corners<00:02:43.640> backwards

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
maneuver around corners backwards

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.660 
maneuver around corners backwards
forwards<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.680> difficult<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.190> master<00:02:46.519> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
forwards it's difficult to master the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.580 
forwards it's difficult to master the
strafe<00:02:47.060> maneuver<00:02:47.629> as<00:02:47.720> well<00:02:47.900> which<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.170> quite

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
strafe maneuver as well which is quite

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.440 
strafe maneuver as well which is quite
handy<00:02:48.650> when<00:02:49.190> you're<00:02:49.310> dodging<00:02:49.489> these<00:02:49.730> bastards

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
handy when you're dodging these bastards

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.910 
handy when you're dodging these bastards
in<00:02:50.599> front<00:02:50.870> when<00:02:50.989> they<00:02:51.080> fire<00:02:51.260> fire<00:02:51.560> balls<00:02:51.800> i'll

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
in front when they fire fire balls i'll

classic factor of pulmonary place it in

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.030 
classic factor of pulmonary place it in
number<00:03:04.970> one<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:06.049> unfortunately<00:03:06.799> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
number one but unfortunately the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.770 
number one but unfortunately the
interface<00:03:07.430> lets<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.790> game<00:03:07.970> down<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.599> let's

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
interface lets the game down so let's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.500 
interface lets the game down so let's
check<00:03:09.019> out<00:03:09.200> what<00:03:09.410> number<00:03:09.650> three<00:03:09.860> years

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
check out what number three years

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.690 
check out what number three years
righty-ho<00:03:11.510> number<00:03:12.140> three<00:03:12.410> I'm<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.799> massive<00:03:13.670> fan

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
righty-ho number three I'm a massive fan

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.490 
righty-ho number three I'm a massive fan

this is coming out on playstation 3 and
xbox<00:04:02.659> 360<00:04:03.409> as<00:04:03.590> well<00:04:04.480> which<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:05.510> going<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.810> be

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
xbox 360 as well which is going to be

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.530 
xbox 360 as well which is going to be
pretty<00:04:06.110> nice<00:04:06.819> so<00:04:07.819> as<00:04:07.879> you<00:04:08.000> can<00:04:08.120> see<00:04:08.390> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
pretty nice so as you can see the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.000 
pretty nice so as you can see the
graphics<00:04:08.989> aren't<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.349> great<00:04:09.530> because<00:04:09.739> we're

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
graphics aren't that great because we're

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.490 
graphics aren't that great because we're
not<00:04:10.129> in<00:04:10.250> high<00:04:10.280> definition<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:12.170> can<00:04:12.349> move

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
not in high definition you can move

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.529 
not in high definition you can move
around<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:15.079> zoom<00:04:15.379> out<00:04:15.620> thank<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.729> sam<00:04:17.329> wants

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
around you zoom out thank you sam wants

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.249 
around you zoom out thank you sam wants
to<00:04:17.630> go<00:04:17.690> from<00:04:18.019> we<00:04:18.850> that's<00:04:19.850> taking<00:04:20.269> away<00:04:20.299> use<00:04:21.019> the

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
to go from we that's taking away use the

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.370 
to go from we that's taking away use the
toilet<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:23.240> really<00:04:23.509> likely<00:04:23.690> in<00:04:23.990> this<00:04:24.110> game

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
toilet so really likely in this game

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.020 
toilet so really likely in this game
again<00:04:24.830> hopefully<00:04:25.100> we'll<00:04:25.520> see<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.850> high

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
again hopefully we'll see it in high

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.050 
again hopefully we'll see it in high
definition<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.830> let's<00:04:28.250> skip<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.789> by<00:04:29.000> to

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
definition and so let's skip on by to

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.860 
definition and so let's skip on by to
number<00:04:29.510> two<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:31.370> guys<00:04:31.580> here<00:04:31.940> we<00:04:32.060> have<00:04:32.330> number

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
number two so guys here we have number

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.800 
number two so guys here we have number
two<00:04:33.380> in<00:04:33.740> my<00:04:34.010> top<00:04:34.280> five<00:04:34.310> games<00:04:34.850> on<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.389> ipad<00:04:35.539> at
