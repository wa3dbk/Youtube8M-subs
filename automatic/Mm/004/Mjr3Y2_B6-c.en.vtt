00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.040
 too little virtual memory 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.870
 I hope the bank did not have to see 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.329
 such message from vindouz 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.299
 if you had to deal with such 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.299
 problem then this article is for you 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.289
 every computer has an operational and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.829
 physical memory 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:19.810
 RAM RAM 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.119
 random access memory 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.999
 use programs for their own purposes as 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.649
 temporary commands are kept by me 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.910
 addressee and stuff you need to correct 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.020
 work 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.990
 why would such memory be better for all 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.350
 computer ability work 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.200
 physical memory hard disk 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.890
 this is memory for data storage 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.520
 movies music program 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.240
 sometimes computers lack operational 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.590
 memory for proper operation and he 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.150
 accesses virtual memory 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.890
 virtual memory is hard memory 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.540
 disk dedicated operating system 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.120
 in other words using physical 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.900
 memory is complemented by operational 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.130
 what to do if there is a need for 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.820
 replenishment of virtual memory 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.450
 for this we go to my properties 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.440
 computer 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.730
 right-clicking on 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.760
 my computer icon 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.420
 and choose the appropriate 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.270
 paragraph 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.090
 open the tab further and 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.720
 we select parameters speed as 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.870
 shown in the picture 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.830
 In the new window, select the tab 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.310
 additionally find the item 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 virtual memory and click change 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.440
 we select a disk from which will be 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.580
 paging location selected 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.080
 disc name the disc itself does not have 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.190
 values ​​select item special size 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.460
 initial and maximum value 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.780
 memory size depends on 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.880
 the amount of your ram and 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.930
 write down in original size 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.640
 recommended values 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670
 now let's go keeper way 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.070
 maximum loss amount write all 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.060
 greater number eg 7 thousand 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 and press the set button 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.319
 vedenov messages 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.989
 remember the number 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.909
 after that click on Kiev 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 enter this number the maximum size 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.999
 then we accept all these changes 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.950
 pressing the parts button 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.839
 in every executive committee 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.969
 after rebooting the computer will be like 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:34.579
 new
