00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.769
 Hello everyone, I welcome you to 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.900
 the attic you look rubric just 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.119
 physics is where I answer 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.579
 interesting physical issues and today 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.710
 we'll talk about why sound 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.720
 electric guitar is different from sound 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.060
 acoustic really sound violin 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.759
 similar to the sound of a cello trumpet similar to 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.439
 trombone harpsichord is like a piano and in 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.660
 the sound of instruments of the same 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.120
 categories always have something in common 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.219
 but powerful evil squealing electric 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.199
 guitar is completely different from soft 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.420
 melodic acoustic so from where 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.160
 such a striking difference is taken 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.500
 this one guitar 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.149
 but honestly that sharp sound which 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.890
 we associate with electric guitars 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.079
 it's just an effect 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.480
 apply and to cello and piano and 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.850
 so further it is called distortion but 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.039
 historically it originated precisely on guitar and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.839
 true connoisseurs love exactly that 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.059
 who found the guitarists middle 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.829
 last century, let's talk about 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.140
 it and built our release in the form of 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.940
 small stories usual acoustic 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.910
 people listen to the guitar a long time ago 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.860
 over a thousand years and even before it were 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.230
 tools with a similar principle of action 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.190
 hundreds of years of people arranged the volume 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.230
 this tool 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.850
 but with the development of the music industry in 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.530
 the first half of the twentieth century all 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.420
 more and more people wanted to hear 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.460
 famous musicians and in order to 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.890
 the guitar could have heard it started getting 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.050
 collector amplifier and here it rushed 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.180
 the amplifier takes the signal namely 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 alternating current from the guitar and increase in 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.930
 amplitudes and by the way largely because of this 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.640
 in electric guitar abandoned big 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.470
 resonator and in fact if play 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.870
 not very loud that gain going on 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.940
 no distortion and the sound is very similar to 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.130
 acoustic beat but if you play very 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.780
 loud the amplifier can not cope because 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.550
 in any scheme there are restrictions on 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.350
 amplitude in reality he has 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.720
 limit beyond which he cannot 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.330
 increase it turns out that the signal 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.740
 it shoots from above and below and it turns out 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.780
 completely different rest 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.759
 sound is the main difference but this 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.590
 the effect can be considered even more 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.750
 look at the detail how complicated 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 It seems to signal string vibration but 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.009
 we can decompose it over 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.360
 simple harmonic oscillations but this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.790
 is due to the fact that in the country 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.950
 there is no hesitation about several 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.959
 it turns out that any signal we can 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.090
 match the frequency of 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.280
 which it consists it's called 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.780
 Fourier transform and now final 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.550
 proof if produced 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 fourier transform i with a signal 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.849
 acoustic guitar we get 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.380
 several frequencies 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.630
 but if you do the same 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.700
 overloaded electrical signal 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.620
 we will get a lot of guitars 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.769
 frequencies even those that are not in the spectrum 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.230
 acoustic guitar these frequencies decorate 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.510
 the sound of an electric guitar and even more 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.519
 removes it from the speaker that is in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.280
 harsh sound of an electric guitar more contribution 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.380
 makes the amplifier than the ghetto itself and more 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.780
 one interesting fact is electric guitars 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.489
 owes its sound to magnets 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.040
 possible if not for them we would not 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.780
 heard to endures 10 or metal because 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.430
 the very popularity of the pickup exactly 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.290
 thanks to the magnet happens 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.390
 converting string vibrations into 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.010
 there is an electric signal under each string 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.290
 permanent magnet and when the string 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.299
 fluctuates in this magnetic field in it 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.859
 an electric arises then this 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.380
 electric current creates around itself 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.019
 one more magnetic field just now 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.489
 change but in turn creates 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.950
 the coil is wound around a magnet 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.170
 alternating electric current which 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.269
 fluctuates in time with the string but such 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.640
 long chain but thanks to her 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.010
 contactless way you can turn 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.959
 oscillations of the string into electric current so 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.120
 what for an electric guitar buy only 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.799
 metal strings on others she doesn't 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.690
 working on it all put huskies

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.319
 go to the attic and thanks for watching 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.130
 stop listen 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.590
 your heart beats like 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.710
 how mohammed vi is born 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.100
 small is it and the bow how fast spins 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:05.040
 always because if there is a miracle in the world toa 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.040
 Nuva around you the whole world around you
