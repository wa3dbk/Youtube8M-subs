yolk and my sugar and there is a reason
that<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.740> don't<00:02:01.010> want<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.430> overwork<00:02:02.150> your

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
that you don't want to overwork your

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.680 
that you don't want to overwork your
butter<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.170> your<00:02:03.620> flour<00:02:04.180> when<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.390> what

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
butter and your flour when you what

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.540 
butter and your flour when you what
we're<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.590> goal<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:06.860> we're<00:02:07.190> trying<00:02:07.220> to

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
we're the goal that we're trying to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.090 
we're the goal that we're trying to
achieve<00:02:07.700> with<00:02:07.970> this<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.750> kind<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.380> crumbly

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
achieve with this is kind of a crumbly

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.000 
achieve with this is kind of a crumbly
texture<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.810> we<00:02:11.990> want<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.290> keep<00:02:12.500> some<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.830> this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
texture so we want to keep some of this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.580 
texture so we want to keep some of this
fat<00:02:13.400> whole<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.420> don't<00:02:14.630> want<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.870> break<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.410> down

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
fat whole we don't want to break it down

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.110 
fat whole we don't want to break it down
we<00:02:15.920> want<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.190> keep<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.550> where<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:16.850> nice

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
we want to keep it where it's nice

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.140 
we want to keep it where it's nice
little<00:02:18.110> bitty<00:02:18.260> balls<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.760> reason<00:02:20.120> that

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
little bitty balls and the reason that

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.930 
little bitty balls and the reason that
you<00:02:20.330> do<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.920> going<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.310> expand

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
you do that is that it's going to expand

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.790 
you do that is that it's going to expand
that<00:02:23.209> steam<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.540> going<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.959> release<00:02:24.350> when<00:02:24.620> it's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
that steam is going to release when it's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.449 
that steam is going to release when it's
in<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.070> oven

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
in the oven

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.660 
in the oven
and<00:02:25.820> when<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.810> steam<00:02:27.110> releases<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.340> going

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
and when that steam releases it's going

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.320 
and when that steam releases it's going
to<00:02:28.760> make<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.480> crust<00:02:29.840> kind<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.910> puff<00:02:31.910> up<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
to make the crust kind of puff up a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.729 
to make the crust kind of puff up a
little<00:02:32.570> bit<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.230> you're<00:02:33.350> gonna<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.680> that

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
little bit so you're gonna get that

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.479 
little bit so you're gonna get that
combination<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.959> nice<00:02:36.200> dense<00:02:36.739> quality<00:02:37.310> of

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
combination of the nice dense quality of

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.940 
combination of the nice dense quality of
a<00:02:37.580> good<00:02:37.790> shortening<00:02:38.239> bread<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.590> fluffy

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
a good shortening bread with a fluffy

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.240 
a good shortening bread with a fluffy
crust<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.020> wonderful<00:02:42.590> pie<00:02:42.830> crust

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
crust like a like a wonderful pie crust

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.460 
crust like a like a wonderful pie crust
you<00:02:43.430> kind<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.730> get<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.970> idea<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.989> it's<00:02:45.200> through

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
you kind of get the idea so it's through

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.070 
you kind of get the idea so it's through
leaving<00:02:45.800> those<00:02:46.670> little<00:02:47.000> crumblies<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
leaving those little crumblies in the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.260 
leaving those little crumblies in the
butter<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.410> letting<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:48.950> steam<00:02:49.459> expand

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
butter and letting that steam expand

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.479 
butter and letting that steam expand
that<00:02:50.540> you're<00:02:50.750> gonna<00:02:50.870> achieve

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
that you're gonna achieve

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.949 
that you're gonna achieve
the<00:02:52.489> crumbly<00:02:52.970> mess<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.420> we're<00:02:53.570> looking<00:02:53.720> for

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
the crumbly mess that we're looking for

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.199 
the crumbly mess that we're looking for
so<00:02:54.620> let<00:02:54.770> me<00:02:54.890> get<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.190> mixed<00:02:55.580> together<00:02:55.910> give

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
so let me get this mixed together give

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.300 
so let me get this mixed together give
me<00:02:56.330> just<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.840> second<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.560> can<00:02:57.590> bring<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.190> up

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
me just a second so we can bring it up

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.470 
me just a second so we can bring it up
to<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:59.660> consistency<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.500> we're<00:03:00.860> wanting

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
to the consistency that we're wanting

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.789
