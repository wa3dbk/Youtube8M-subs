00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
in between now this is going to require

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.830 
in between now this is going to require
you<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.680> pretty<00:00:20.250> quick<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.850> combat

you to be a pretty quick and combat
efficient<00:00:22.320> there's<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> small<00:00:23.180> margin<00:00:24.180> of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
efficient there's a small margin of

error<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:25.080> for<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:26.130> don't<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
error here for you but don't go out of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
error here for you but don't go out of
your<00:00:26.760> way<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.240> try<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> get<00:00:27.720> any<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.990> these

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
your way and try to get any of these

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.189 
your way and try to get any of these
time<00:00:28.890> bonuses<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> there's<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.630> couple<00:00:30.869> here

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
time bonuses and there's a couple here

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
time bonuses and there's a couple here
at<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> beginning<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.949> kind<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.730> go<00:00:32.880> off<00:00:33.090> here

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
at the beginning I kind of go off here

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.630 
at the beginning I kind of go off here
because<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.840> figure<00:00:34.110> six<00:00:34.500> seconds<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.219> I

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
because I figure six seconds and I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
because I figure six seconds and I
probably<00:00:35.910> spent<00:00:36.510> about<00:00:36.750> three<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.410> get

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
probably spent about three to go get

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.770 
probably spent about three to go get
them<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.940> worth<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
them so that was kind of worth it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.510 
them so that was kind of worth it
there's<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> few<00:00:40.860> more<00:00:41.070> towards

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
there's going to be a few more towards

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.119 
there's going to be a few more towards
the<00:00:41.640> end<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> tunnel<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.350> what

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the end in a tunnel which we will what

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.979 
the end in a tunnel which we will what
you<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.730> well<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.840> see

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you will get as well and you can see

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.310 
you will get as well and you can see
that<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:46.770> were<00:00:47.070> needed<00:00:47.579> when<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.320> figure

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that those were needed when you figure

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
that those were needed when you figure
out<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.620> when<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:49.950> at<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.129> final<00:00:50.820> time

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
out and when you look at my final time

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
out and when you look at my final time
which<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:53.039> would<00:00:53.160> barely<00:00:53.610> ten<00:00:53.940> seconds

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
which was what would barely ten seconds

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.689 
which was what would barely ten seconds
left<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> clock<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.680> we're<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:55.980> racing

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
left on the clock so we're just racing

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
left on the clock so we're just racing
through<00:00:56.730> these<00:00:57.090> checkpoints<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
through these checkpoints the this is a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.209 
through these checkpoints the this is a
very<00:00:58.859> windy<00:01:00.410> course<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.710> you're<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
very windy course here you're going to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.189 
very windy course here you're going to
have<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> turns<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.899> highly

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
with the square button between them

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
with the square button between them
there's<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.310> jumps<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.090> well<00:01:09.390> and

as you can see it's very windy you're

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.780 
as you can see it's very windy you're
going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.710> hitting<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> lot<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.369> different

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
things use your power slide again to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.609 
things use your power slide again to
navigate<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.880> your<00:01:42.060> thrusters<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.380> boost

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
batmobile weapons this is pretty easy

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.070 
batmobile weapons this is pretty easy
and<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.460> once<00:02:14.000> we're<00:02:14.210> done<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.810> we're

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and then once we're done with this we're

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.950 
and then once we're done with this we're
gonna<00:02:15.170> go<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.680> get<00:02:15.800> back<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.280> road<00:02:16.580> again

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.050 

they'll<00:02:24.590> get<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.950> same<00:02:25.160> thing<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.880> down

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
they'll get the same thing going down

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.990 
they'll get the same thing going down
these<00:02:26.240> alleys<00:02:26.890> we've<00:02:27.890> got<00:02:28.010> another<00:02:28.310> jump<00:02:28.730> here

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
these alleys we've got another jump here

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.090 
these alleys we've got another jump here
if<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:29.960> line<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.200> up<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.710> makes<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.040> a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
if you can line that up it makes it a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.540 
if you can line that up it makes it a
lot<00:02:31.280> easier<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.920> we're<00:02:34.070> gonna<00:02:34.190> twist

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
lot easier and then we're gonna twist

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.610 
lot easier and then we're gonna twist
around<00:02:34.820> here<00:02:37.360> now<00:02:38.360> again<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.660> saved<00:02:39.110> up<00:02:39.290> all<00:02:39.410> my

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
secondary weapon energy so it's level

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.290 
secondary weapon energy so it's level
four<00:02:42.260> which<00:02:43.100> means<00:02:43.340> I'm<00:02:43.490> gonna<00:02:43.640> use<00:02:43.820> missiles

these time bonuses right here there's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.400 
these time bonuses right here there's
one<00:03:02.090> up<00:03:02.270> here<00:03:02.450> on<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.660> ceiling<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.230> then<00:03:03.350> a
