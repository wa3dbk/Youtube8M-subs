00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.640
 I 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.640
 yes 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.550
 this time and so we can play code if 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 has come methods to inaugurate a little 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.540
 also this game the new generation 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.610
 of consoles but we started it with the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.450
 principle I have personally played two 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.849
 games 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.080
 I have arrived nothing 40 minutes ago and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.000
 I have had the luck of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.950
 find heading very fast because there 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 little people at the moment online 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.210
 connected only now about 300 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.980
 people when I was angel before 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.570
 recording a video of a video 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 comparative has not been able to connect in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.290
 a public game because there was 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 only 70 is obvious because the console 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.920
 just left and there are a few people who 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 you can buy the first day the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.219
 console but now it's increasing 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.440
 I have been lucky to find a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.570
 leaving very early and I have left him 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.370
 left the new command to the method so that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.840
 for me to play avei I'm better 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.250
 talk and play 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.050
 but good what we wanted you 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.310
 comment so I've played can 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.430
 see and methods also agrees 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.930
 with me in that graphically the game is 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.000
 slightly better the change is also not 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.430
 brutal as some said and how 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.020
 I expected but yes there is an improvement 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.210
 above all and a problem that had in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.770
 xbox 360 is that the enemies are 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.050
 often confused with the environment 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.300
 it was hard to distinguish them in xbox one no 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.460
 happens so much the enemies look better the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.260
 game is cleaner within what 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.690
 it fits but good in general the game is 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.820
 pretty clean in this new console 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.320
 the new generation and the truth is that 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.899
 much appreciated because it was a problem 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.970
 that there was in xbox 360 and that we did not 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.920
 I just liked too good or nothing 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.570
 in xbox go the enemies are distinguished 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.729
 better both fat and long 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.590
 distances the textures are a little bit 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.090
 brighter the game is brighter 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.560
 in general we have tried to lower the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.960
 brightness to see if it was problem of the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.630
 configuration but not the game the mushroom 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.759
 default of the game is that it is a bit 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.130
 brighter the brighter the map 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.990
 some maps about everything else not in 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.690
 others do not notice so much else of the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.429
 game you hear better we're talking 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.600
 of first impressions already has been the 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.549
 what do we look like weapons 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.890
 they sound more the steps sound better in 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.780
 xbox 360 I remember that yes they sounded 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.819
 the steps but I did not know if they came 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.319
 front behind the sides some 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.870
 times and brave others that confused you 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.970
 quite this does not happen anymore in xbox one and 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.560
 has been the sound is also expected to 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.620
 improve in a new generation of 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.950
 consoles 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.290
 more or less the fluidity is the same 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.549
 slightly improved and small details 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.110
 that we have seen yet for example 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.510
 when you get into the water, then the water 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.220
 it looks a little better and when you shoot a 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.940
 enemy or short distances it comes out 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.370
 like here and if you look good but good 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.140
 if you are watching the video in 3 160 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.480
 pixels is not that you're going to 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.829
 see but good if you can see it in high 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.420
 definition, what are you going to be able to do well? 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.769
 it comes out as a little blood as 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.200
 when it fires it is an enemy nothing 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.819
 important but good but small 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.930
 details that we have discussing 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.730
 simply what we have seen during 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.290
 the first games we have gotten 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.849
 in a team match because it's the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.940
 only game mode that can be played 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.090
 for now there is no one playing in their 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.950
 other game modes and that's where we 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.590
 we have been able to get total we are doing well 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.150
 to teach you and to fulfill what 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.040
 what we wanted with this video that was 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.930
 explain what the first 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.540
 impressions simply of course 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.190
 we will release more videos with more analysis 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 background but for now what we want 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.420
 that you know during the first day of 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.709
 launch of xbox one is our 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.640
 impressions what we thought was the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.440
 game 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.390
 so you see it basically sometimes 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.430
 first impressions deceive but in 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.150
 Most things are going very well 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.650
 know the 66 to 62 as more 25 13 not 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.050
 They are not bad the game to the rest 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.569
 little and 10 goes 10 casualties to reach 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.580
 the scoring limit but well I do not know 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.170
 if you want to comment I have more these 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.660
 when with the new command where the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.250
 joysticks are smaller and where the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.520
 Trip of the triggers is also 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.520
 less 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:06.510
 it is much more comfortable since it is 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.400
 sweating enough the command will go well for the 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.989
 dinner and the bad guys like me small and 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.880
 have the very big hands the best 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.370
 it would be even in the fingers a little bit can 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.320
 but good but not the mango in general 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.940
 that's how it's not very good and I think 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.130
 which is the best things at least 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.280
 for me who has is this new 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.720
 generation of consoles in microsoft 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.450
 I think you're going to lose methods after 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.370
 everything 74-74 I do not know what it is that is what 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.080
 will happen at the end but we have 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.580
 could already tell us what appears 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.880
 a whole in the end you have won victory 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.210
 for 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.770
 for method 28 16 good people see 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.480
 that is not yet quite used to 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.670
 because one this 13 14 good is equal what 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.720
 that's the most important thing 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.430
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.770
 guys that you liked our 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.090
 first impressions by the way when 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.470
 we were when you are when there is a 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.510
 which has been ments account and 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.280
 I want to show you when you're playing 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.600
 so calm game now we have him 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 you have connected but you can 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.470
 do it with the command you give the button 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.570
 xbox showing me the whole camera so that 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.420
 so you can see it if you hit the 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.900
 button up here and you're playing 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.240
 then you can go to the main interface 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.710
 of the console and you can see what 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.840
 if I want to know the best is 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.790
 listening to a song and instead of 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.370
 listen to the next one of the playlist 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.170
 you want to listen to the one that goes at the last minute 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.300
 you better have to take a call in 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.370
 sky because it's saying something on skype to 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.750
 someone want me that I know what it is 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.640
 you want to watch television for a moment 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.320
 you want to stop playing because you can 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.520
 do this by hitting the xbox button 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.710
 they are very good you leave the game 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.660
 automatically very quickly and 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.580
 you can change and you can go there where 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.480
 you want if you have someone connected not 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.460
 is the case 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.530
 You can tell by voice and console 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.180
 case and now we will also try but not 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.650
 guys this has been all be attentive 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.390
 to the youtube channel of the lvbp because 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.120
 soon we will take more analysis 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.130
 background of all things especially in 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.270
 this call of duty channel goes where 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.930
 we will be doing the whole division 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.910
 pain of kot of this new season and 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.980
 is what interests us not basically 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.390
 see you guys soon in new 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.390
 videos do not miss it goodbye
