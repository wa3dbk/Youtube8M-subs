choose<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> different<00:01:56.340> soul<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.540> because

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
choose a different soul just because

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
choose a different soul just because
it's<00:01:57.990> kind<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> crazy<00:01:59.040> hodgepodge<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
patterns with the upper here and then

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
patterns with the upper here and then
the<00:02:01.740> crazy<00:02:01.979> marble<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:03.030> definitely
