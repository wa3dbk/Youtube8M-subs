running on bail methane which is really

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.649 
running on bail methane which is really
new<00:03:20.260> technology<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.879> will<00:03:22.000> tell<00:03:22.269> me<00:03:22.299> that

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
new technology that will tell me that

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.440 
new technology that will tell me that
the<00:03:22.780> gas<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.579> vehicles<00:03:24.970> running<00:03:25.150> our

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the gas that this vehicles running our

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.949 
the gas that this vehicles running our
is<00:03:25.900> actually<00:03:26.409> produced<00:03:27.099> in<00:03:27.629> landfill<00:03:28.629> sites

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
is actually produced in landfill sites

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.289 
is actually produced in landfill sites
and<00:03:29.200> under<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.859> around<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.400> them<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:31.180> it

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
and under and around on them so it

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.229 
and under and around on them so it
really<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.659> recycling<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:34.030> gold

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239

the<00:04:05.980> engine<00:04:06.159> it's<00:04:06.909> a<00:04:07.000> three<00:04:07.239> liter<00:04:07.389> engine<00:04:08.010> and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
the engine it's a three liter engine and

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.030 
the engine it's a three liter engine and
it<00:04:09.729> just<00:04:10.030> raves<00:04:10.379> exactly<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.560> same<00:04:11.829> as<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
it just raves exactly the same as the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.640 
it just raves exactly the same as the
diesel<00:04:12.549> version<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.479> very<00:04:13.930> much<00:04:14.109> this<00:04:14.349> is<00:04:14.409> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
diesel version so very much this is the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.250 
diesel version so very much this is the
future<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.090> faculty<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.139> the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
future and the faculty that this is the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.009 
future and the faculty that this is the
way<00:04:17.409> forward<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.459> alternative<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
way forward this is the alternative the

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.120 
way forward this is the alternative the
viable<00:04:20.470> alternative<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.250> diesel<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:23.130> what

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
viable alternative the diesel and what

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.670 
viable alternative the diesel and what
the<00:04:24.460> iveco<00:04:24.909> will<00:04:25.389> do<00:04:25.599> is<00:04:25.960> they<00:04:26.169> will<00:04:26.199> put<00:04:26.530> you

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the iveco will do is they will put you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.760 
the iveco will do is they will put you
in<00:04:26.740> touch<00:04:27.010> with<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:28.330> gas<00:04:28.930> company<00:04:29.440> who<00:04:29.620> will

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770
