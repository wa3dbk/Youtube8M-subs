I<00:02:08.580> understand<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.360> point<00:02:09.570> is<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.050> show

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I understand the point is to show

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.530 
I understand the point is to show
there's<00:02:10.710> still<00:02:11.010> some<00:02:11.340> good<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.610> two<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.270> these

a<00:02:17.310> bit<00:02:17.340> awkward<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> fight<00:02:18.990> come

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350

maybe if the line was crossed in a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.880 
maybe if the line was crossed in a
cooler<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.630> more<00:02:24.690> vicious<00:02:25.230> way<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
cooler and more vicious way the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.920 
cooler and more vicious way the
responses<00:02:26.490> would<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:27.210> felt<00:02:27.600> more<00:02:27.900> natural
