 good green banana we start the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.880
 Cebiche preparation we need a 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.040
 as I'm more or less and we're going to 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.200
 mix the ingredients 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.470
 here we have started with an onion 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 white 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.220
 the green pepper 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.479
 let's add the red paprika 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.850
 the celery that is here 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.269
 we go back to these vegetables a little 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.140
 and that we are going to add a bit of 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.140
 Pepper 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.870
 Salt 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.870
 a little pepper salt we stir 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.500
 As I told you, it's very fast, very, very 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.230
 quick here we have more or less a 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.040
 three tablespoons of creamy serum 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.940
 It is very typical of our region 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.610
 creamy subero 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.910
 and we are going to add cream 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.910
 milk 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.240
 already having all these ingredients 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.510
 mixed then finally we add 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.230
 palm hearts cut 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.560
 and we just give you a little walk because the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.870
 palmito as you see is very delicate is very 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.349
 simple is very sensitive crumbles 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.230
 very easy and very softly we give it as 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.080
 a vueltica 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.170
 to integrate it with everyone else 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.900
 ingredients very gently so that it does not 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.080
 disarm us do not give us sant in the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.080
 palm hearts 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.150
 I give them a trick with the palmito 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.310
 palmetto once they have a little bag 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.770
 we remove the bag and cut it 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.560
 good to have a little water with 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.020
 concentrated lemon so that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.209
 he takes but obviously a touch of 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.970
 lemon and that too suddenly we 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.190
 We know and we remove that excess 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.440
 iodine taste to iodine that come sometimes 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.930
 the fruits of the sea then it is a trick 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.419
 What is done to the heart is cut 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.609
 go through lemon water and leave some 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.770
 seconds simply and runs off 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.630
 again and ready it runs off well 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.030
 because he absorbs a lot of water then 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.090
 two functions is not lemon flavored 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.340
 and we also take it off is a little 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.380
 taste of iodine that is ready then 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.320
 as I was saying we already have the ceviche 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.600
 ready let's make the plate assembly 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.820
 and this is something that you can accompany 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.930
 with whatever you want at this moment what 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.060
 let's go with the chips 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.610
 bananas as we had said but what 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.710
 you can make with or with soda crackers 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.780
 in short with what you have in your house 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.430
 and we will do the assembly but 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.979
 then let's place 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.470
 present this palm heart ceviche 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:03.009
 very tasty crab easy to make 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.480
 they just prepared 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.310
 let's ride it this way 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.810
 so that you prepare it in your house 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.760
 to receive a visit as an entry 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.110
 sometimes we do not know what to prepare 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.130
 entrance sometimes they tell us there is a 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.940
 well rich entrance 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.730
 and then cut us this heart of hearts 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.560
 is a good option to have for 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.560

 with a little parsley 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.210
 just to center the color and we're going to 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:53.400
 add as I said 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.400
