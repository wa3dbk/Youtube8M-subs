 read guennec valley new era games games 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:22.109
 for playstation 3 playstation 4 and xbox 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:24.900
 one in digital media beauty galley must 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.449
 in the new area bringing another video 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.380
 commented on you guys in this video 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.620
 no more a video today my serious guy 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'm silly to see that news that we 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.079
 We have today none of the news of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.690
 today because it goes in good kind long games 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.300
 generally very interesting and I 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.030
 particularly the short game and I 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.840
 I think the longest game I've played 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.550
 in this 8th direction if I'm not mistaken it's the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.710
 bodyboard I'm there with 40 hours 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.379
 and I will not be so connected anymore. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.570
 because I was exploring the map I was 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.390
 I've been there for a year looking for detail by 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.299
 detail I'm born with 40 hours of play 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 on the right hand or 40 hours is a good 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.140
 playing time is rare a current game is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.140
 seal art could hold for more 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 40 hours but if you turn on 40 hours it is not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 absolutely nothing close to 200 hours 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.380
 what will we have here? 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.320
 dewitt 3 was spoken by twitter 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 since the game of the 23rd will have control by the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 at least 200 hours you're connected, which are 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.840
 200 hours of play I do not have this 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 practically no koff of which is a 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.270
 multiplayer game that I always played 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.700
 father codex I have neither 200 hours and mw3 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.619
 for example in black ops two that are 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.229
 I played games like hell but it's obvious 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.630
 which is not an entire campaign 200 hours 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.970
 No, what 's the story? 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.950
 if it were a 200-hour campaign 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 for good it would be a bizarre business 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 bizarre, right? 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.610
 but the old one was told that if you want 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.710
 to do at least a good part of the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 what's in the game you're going to have to spend 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.700
 at least 200 hours 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.090
 the witcher game itself is already a game 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.840
 very long nÃ© the witcher 2 the limit 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.599
 original or end 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.090
 they are already very long games that demand there 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.000
 a good time to play since you have 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 your character is also the law of the map 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.410
 giant we already see in a rhythm 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.349
 even more in 83 and type 1200 hours all 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.510
 well it's not nonsense when it comes 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.459
 of an open world game even more in the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.040
 fall style or hitcher in style 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.010
 souza embroidery breaking these styles 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.830
 so open world games but nothing of 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.140
 Thank you, people, we would not have 200 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.140
 hours of play at least sense the game 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.200
 be giant in terms of space in HD 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.660
 How many gigas or 23 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.849
 you need to install nine down there 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.200
 your playstation 4 xbox the year for example 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.470
 be connected 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.400
 nothing less than 50 gigs 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.110
 50 gigs guys, it's coming, I'm going to have to 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.180
 choose a half dozen games there to 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.390
 install when you fire 3 and the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.849
 batman arkham night which will also be at 50 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.370
 gigas details about that just a rumor 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.989
 is not really confirmed that the game 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.670
 50 gigas but according to 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.130
 some rumors according to some 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.049
 50 gigabytes is the minimum required 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.329
 to install dismiss 3 and I 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.660
 Sincerely, I do not doubt anything, you 're going to 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.700
 can be even more so with the updates and 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.489
 such that having a better idea to say goodbye 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.950
 uribe has more than 50 gigs with its 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.410
 updates and such then issue 3 eu 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.389
 I think it's up to a bit more 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.560
 50 the game is scheduled to be released 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:54.450
 on May 19th for xbox one 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.269
 ps4 ipc already next month since today 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.340
 It's April 1st , and no people who are not 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.370
 joke here is not to build 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.620
 It's not a catch, and soon it will really be alright. 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.040
 long as it was to imagine more 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.500
 who knows, being there confirmed the greatest 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.169
 game of this generation who knows at least 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.310
 until now or who knows the biggest game of the 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.859
 year so far 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.329
