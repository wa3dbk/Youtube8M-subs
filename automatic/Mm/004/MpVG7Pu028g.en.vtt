00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.809
 for him to reporters on Wednesday to 0 outside the house I stopped thinking about the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.919
 other years according to the delegate 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.909
 this methodology is not good 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.259
 We're not going to work here and work for the manager. 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.890
 presence in the event already in wood 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 the first step is to hit the newspaper 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 became cheaper 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.640
 last year like this 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.030
 but what to do 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.190
 stay tuned 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.429
 and stay like this 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.429
 when it should have been abandoned at the base of the claw 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.629
 in gravataÃ­ 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.920
 It should stay like this. 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.260
 said Tarsus 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.640
 until 8 pm 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.390
 for decades the same acronym in English 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 before the champions league round this season in his accounts 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.960
 it's a wonder he spoke 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.760
 then case to be treated 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.500
 Monday's agenda refers to one of them, it will again be 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.350
 Independent of maria da feira 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.870
 to that house 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.360
 the round has come to an end 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.979
 finally another teacher ends up using the bottle 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 carefully 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
 not to mention the call 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.969
 so I have to put myself now 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.999
 alcohol and even my focus but does not necessarily need to rotate with 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.239
 alcohol a lot of people think ugly massera guarantees that it will catch fire to people 

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.660
 what do you mean by what? 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.560
 internally the service to the police station 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 and meets little 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.900
 to this recipe of education 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.380
 twenty years now that you already take into account both loved no one was injured 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.250
 the debates 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.579
