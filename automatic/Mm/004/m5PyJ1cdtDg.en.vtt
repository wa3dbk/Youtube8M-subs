00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.010
 I want to tell you how easy it is 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.440
 make wellness cocktails i think 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.540
 that you already know a little about them but 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
 probably it will not be superfluous to say that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.920
 they are very tasty which is not very healthy 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.439
 and very nutritious and they saturate 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.710
 the body is all he needs all the right 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.380
 microelements of course we are talking about 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.920
 the lungs were like proteins that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.470
 contained in these cocktails and we have three 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 kinds of cocktails this is strawberry 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.430
 vanilla and my love and chocolate time 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.590
 I've already talked about proteins 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.230
 i will say that here are three types of proteins 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.719
 green peas milk and eggs 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 all products are highly natural 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.110
 so this we asked stiga wall 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 cocktail maker what is higher 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.760
 degree natural eggs for example he 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.829
 He said that this crust is not fed 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 not such antibiotic chemicals 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.670
 only grain and that's from such fingers 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.359
 taken eggs cooking this 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 cocktail but today as I said I 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.900
 show you how to make a cocktail 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.530
 chocolate 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 why chocolate love it but 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 first he gives energy 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 he gives the same energy even more than 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.480
 a cup of coffee but a cup of coffee is not quite 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.880
 healthy product chocolate on here with us 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.290
 cocoa 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.030
 chocolate cocoa powder it allows 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.880
 save this here energy up which is us 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.190
 need but removed the oil and 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.790
 what makes any chocolate really 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.310
 high-calorie and in every serving cocktails 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.080
 only 65 kilocalories that is, they 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.330
 let us not get better 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 also chocolate makes the body 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.290
 produce serotonin that is 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.060
 substance as if to cause hormone of happiness 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.490
 why many women and not only 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.700
 a woman loves chocolate because we are ourselves 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 good feel but be any cocktail 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.140
 then strawberry or vanilla 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.950
 he makes us feel good 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.860
 low glycemic index that is it 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.959
 energy which comes in and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.420
 long they persist so we ate a 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.209
 then want to sleep then we have a vigorous 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.150
 day so we know what cocktails 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.330
 be sure to order the container 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.910
 both for shakers and in every shaker there is 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.420
 Here is such a spoon and dimensional very convenient 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.320
 and now I got a full spoon 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.100
 chocolate mixes are like children 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.640

 some little water just we're in now 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.690
