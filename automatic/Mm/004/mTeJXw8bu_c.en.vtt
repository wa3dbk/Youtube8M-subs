00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 your fingers god bless russian 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.589
 pranker hiding under the nickname vavan 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.210
 called the presidential administration 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.990
 Belarus and introduced himself as the son of Victor 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 Yanukovych 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.269
 deposed leader of Ukraine he succeeded 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 personally talk with alexander lukashenko 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.980
 during the conversation pranker made it clear 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.680
 that his father may have to come 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.769
 to belarus because there is a danger 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.080
 that it will be given to Kiev vavan pretended 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.320
 that is afraid of how the Kiev authorities 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.340
 can do with the former president 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.290
 Belarusian leader who even on 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 public never for a word in a pocket 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.980
 climbs was even more outspoken during 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 as he considered private conversations 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.719
 no kairi right length to things 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.210
 be they can not let him thank you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.100
 I will say that he was not under the head war 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 then Lukashenko showed hospitality 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.829
 inviting Viktor Yanukovych to his family 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 move to belarus it is he who wants 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.409
 come Belarus please at any 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.140
 time just me for the day tell we were going 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.170
 mts and meet in any composition 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 happen family runs let alone 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.270
 as he decides, I will find this at any time 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.740
 time to slim 6 to talk 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.259
 fundamentally discuss issues and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.270
 present and future as 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.390
 thanks pranker offered 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.430
 President, we give you a gift 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:36.110
 golden loaf we have here 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:39.270
 repulsive in the collection seen at the top 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.290
 how did they rob our residences here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.210
 some things still remain again 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.189
 it 's about the golden button which was 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.780
 found in a residence detached from 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.970
 Ukrainian authorities 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.250
 many other valuables were found there 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.770
 things seem like the president of belarus 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.750
 bought into this rally and now he is angry 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.700
 Alexander Lukashenko gave the service 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.979
 security week on the calculation 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 Russian pranker, he said that in 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.890
 otherwise, send chapter 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.479
 departments I quote on the preparation of feed 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.739
 however, not only vavan 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.530
 Belarusian president and his 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.150
 jokes believed the administration and the one who 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.370
 apparently listened to this 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.680
 telephone conversation and published it 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.780
 before the pranker himself told 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.920
 the truth is vavan suspects this 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.870
 Ukrainian intelligence 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 it's no secret that the special services 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.760
 follow the world leaders we are great 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.890
 remember who listened to the phone angels 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.000
 Merkel in their collection probably already 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.130
 a few 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.709
 interesting passages from private 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.090
 talk of world leaders but this they 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.090
 probably not yet heard
