00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
multiplayer mode we created that we

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.370 
multiplayer mode we created that we
called<00:01:42.770> hunter<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:44.630> interest<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.110> time

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
called hunter in the interest of time

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.020 
called hunter in the interest of time
we'll<00:01:45.710> only<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:45.950> nine<00:01:46.280> players<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.789> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
we'll only have nine players on the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.550 
we'll only have nine players on the
stage<00:01:47.240> playing<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:47.780> instead<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.380> full

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
stage playing it instead of the full

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.830 
stage playing it instead of the full
roster<00:01:49.009> of<00:01:49.130> 16<00:01:49.580> that<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:49.880> most<00:01:50.149> remote

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
roster of 16 that is most remote

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.380 
roster of 16 that is most remote
features<00:01:51.289> but<00:01:52.039> let's<00:01:52.729> give<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:52.910> up<00:01:53.000> for<00:01:53.060> our

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
features but let's give it up for our

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.470 
features but let's give it up for our
nine<00:01:53.780> players

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.590 

so<00:02:02.200> hunter<00:02:03.100> mode<00:02:03.400> is<00:02:03.640> essentially<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> true

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
so hunter mode is essentially a true
