00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
things because that's what apparently

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.960

and the PlayStation 3 controller

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.279 
and the PlayStation 3 controller
obviously<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.140> slimmer<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:24.779> can't

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
obviously it's a lot slimmer you can't

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.689 
obviously it's a lot slimmer you can't
tell<00:00:25.470> from<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.189> very<00:00:26.490> lightweight

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
tell from but it's very very lightweight

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.109 
tell from but it's very very lightweight
very<00:00:27.180> lightweight<00:00:27.480> indeed<00:00:28.820> in<00:00:29.820> terms<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
very lightweight indeed in terms of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.930 
very lightweight indeed in terms of
screen<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.289> iphone<00:00:31.560> 3gs<00:00:32.279> sorry

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
screen I've got here an iphone 3gs sorry

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.650 
screen I've got here an iphone 3gs sorry
get<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> 3g<00:00:33.719> rather<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:36.090> birds<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> top

get a 3g rather and we birds on the top
there<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:38.030> think<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> gives<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.390> good<00:00:39.510> indication

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
there I think it gives a good indication

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.470 
there I think it gives a good indication
of<00:00:40.200> how<00:00:40.379> how<00:00:40.800> crystal<00:00:41.670> clear<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> screen<00:00:42.239> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of how how crystal clear the screen is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.760 
of how how crystal clear the screen is
on<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.899> Vita<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.750> move<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.739> a

on the on the Vita so we move up to a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.920 
on the on the Vita so we move up to a
iphone<00:00:47.430> 4<00:00:48.260> again<00:00:49.260> lovely<00:00:49.950> lovely<00:00:50.070> screen

became<00:00:51.930> angry<00:00:52.260> birds<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:53.809> think<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.020> still

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
became angry birds I think you can still

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.099 
became angry birds I think you can still
see<00:00:55.879> it's<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> bigger<00:00:57.149> screen<00:00:57.390> obviously<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
see it's a bigger screen obviously but

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
see it's a bigger screen obviously but
it's<00:00:58.230> also<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.640> gorgeous<00:00:59.640> screen<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> think

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it's also a gorgeous screen but I think

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
it's also a gorgeous screen but I think
it's<00:01:01.410> probably<00:01:01.530> safe<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> say<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.280> when<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's probably safe to say that when it

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.780 
it's probably safe to say that when it
comes<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> veto<00:01:03.539> that's<00:01:03.870> competition<00:01:04.170> is
