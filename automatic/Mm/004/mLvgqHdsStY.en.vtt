with my ring finger on to the fourth
fret<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.440> looks<00:01:45.620> like

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.260 

back<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.510> second<00:01:52.049> fret<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.240> D<00:01:54.240> string

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:04.850 
back to the second fret of the D string
and<00:01:54.840> then<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> hit<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.850> twice<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and then and you hit that twice and I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.310 
and then and you hit that twice and I
mute<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.450> just<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.200> whole

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
mute it just like that so the whole

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.580 
mute it just like that so the whole
thing<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:13.020> probably<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.530> be

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
thing is and you're probably going to be

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170 
thing is and you're probably going to be
putting<00:02:13.739> your<00:02:13.830> own<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.220> stops<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.970> mutes

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
putting your own little stops and mutes

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.090 
putting your own little stops and mutes
in<00:02:15.390> there<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.750> then<00:02:15.930> jazzing<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.440> up<00:02:16.560> quite<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
in there and then jazzing it up quite a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.009 
in there and then jazzing it up quite a
bit<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.840> way<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.230> play<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.870> I

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
bit so the way that I play it is and I

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.270
