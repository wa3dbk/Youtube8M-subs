 something is one thing I can not 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.110

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.239

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.570

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.369
 is today one of the best games ever 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.689
 It's a pretty fun fun game. 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.010
 immense judge 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.900
 while seeing unfair fame in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.340
 campaign that team mode history with 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.250
 You will see the first game because you have 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.960
 a survival mode that by rounds and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.210
 is searching the internet against the staff 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.259
 must make sure that staff have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.720
 same game 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.780
 there is a game that you already serve and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.270
 what team berets and this is working 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.360
 perfectly working full 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.900
 Prefect so the man play doh 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.689
 of the game is the one you are a pretty game 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.610
 simple platform team can but in a 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.250
 point any way you come to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 ready base platform is the survivor 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.329
 of multiplayer but in terms of the campaign 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.880
 One day I have not tried it before. 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.090
 had already experienced multiplayer mode 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.759
 Dad was great it was great I threw the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.780
 survivor worth single-player ready mode 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.159
 campaign will release comex weapons into the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 As you go by, you go picking up 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.509
 I see both in the bag but also enemies 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.229
 the stronger the game quite difficult you 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.870
 can see that the one at which point 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.910
 I was constantly sorry and now 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.000
 will have salvio screen 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.630
 It was kind of an accident, and you ask. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.490
 if all the cases are what it takes to 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.620
 we participated once it was this 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.960
 You comment anything here. 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.430
 in this video below as I have any 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.050
 anything you want it to be and it was 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.520
 funny you say why you 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.540
 they want the game so how do you have why? 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.370
 You want the game, and I will not guide you. 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.100
 comment is what I'm going to do I'll use one 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.840
 site that motor realm and comment 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.210
 that you leave there the documentary number 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.100
 documentary winner is I had I 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.560
 I would think it way easier now than 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.110
 will send foot by foot 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.680
 so I'll send it here and then 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.300
 you can see what I do or not 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.950
 so you stay up to date cash 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.730
 and I will do it after an outbreak 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.130
 then you see it and you stay tuned 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.710
 only six were the defenders 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.540
 understands our box on the total block 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.470
 and fully attended 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.110
 It's just that you are not the winners. 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.820
 is the pope of a video to see if you guys 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.320
 It really was a winner, not you. 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.640
 see the draw to see what it is 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.040
 true and honest 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.890
 therefore of the orthodontic streets commented 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.959
 why do you want ooo game is 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.790
 that I have to say is that I'm not going 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.370
 evaluate the comment will be 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.350
 completely random is but it would be like 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.500
 you see why I play it is always 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.570
 nice to see our reasons for 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.790
 that you do not want and when you want 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.920
 therefore I am very light to divulge the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.680
 video how many more people participate 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.430
 It is better to say a certain team until 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.690
 next 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.690
 shaw and I went
