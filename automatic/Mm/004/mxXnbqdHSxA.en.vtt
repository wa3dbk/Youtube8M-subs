00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
which i use alt my modifier alt 1

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
which i use alt my modifier alt 1
through<00:01:53.579> 12<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.360> 24<00:01:54.899> bonds<00:01:55.200> i<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.439> use

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
through 12 so that's 24 bonds i can use

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.469 
through 12 so that's 24 bonds i can use
it<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.979> my<00:01:56.100> razer<00:01:56.310> naga<00:01:56.520> not<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it with just my razer naga not to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.450 
it with just my razer naga not to
mention<00:01:57.659> i<00:01:57.899> use<00:01:58.079> scroll<00:01:58.710> forward<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.280> my

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
mention i use scroll forward as my

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
mention i use scroll forward as my
targeting<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.299> i<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.659> scroll<00:02:01.079> back<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.680> my

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
targeting and i use scroll back as my

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.020 
targeting and i use scroll back as my
auto<00:02:02.040> attack

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
auto attack

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.560 
auto attack
so<00:02:03.720> essentially<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.290> 26<00:02:04.740> binds<00:02:05.070> 28<00:02:06.030> bonds<00:02:06.450> if

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
so essentially it's 26 binds 28 bonds if

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.859 
so essentially it's 26 binds 28 bonds if
I<00:02:06.690> all<00:02:06.869> modify<00:02:07.440> those<00:02:07.710> two<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:09.209> after

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
I all modify those two and then after

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.300 
I all modify those two and then after
that<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.709> my<00:02:11.160> number<00:02:12.110> my<00:02:13.110> number<00:02:13.440> row<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.250> i

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
that I have my number my number row so i

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.449 
that I have my number my number row so i
use<00:02:14.760> typically<00:02:15.420> than<00:02:15.959> one<00:02:16.170> next<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:16.800> then

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
use typically than one next to one then

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.360 
use typically than one next to one then
i<00:02:17.550> use<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:17.970> through<00:02:18.209> six<00:02:18.450> these<00:02:19.290> tab<00:02:19.650> i<00:02:20.010> use<00:02:20.670> RT

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
i use one through six these tab i use RT

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
i use one through six these tab i use RT
FG<00:02:23.370> z<00:02:24.239> x<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.530> after<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.550> i<00:02:26.610> use<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.150> course

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
FG z x and so after that i use of course

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.510 
FG z x and so after that i use of course
i<00:02:27.480> use<00:02:27.630> my<00:02:27.840> alt<00:02:28.020> modifier<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.340> all

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
i use my alt modifier so that's all

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.410 
i use my alt modifier so that's all
sigma<00:02:30.120> 1<00:02:30.870> through<00:02:31.370> 6<00:02:32.690> alt<00:02:33.690> are<00:02:34.319> all<00:02:34.770> tea<00:02:35.250> all<00:02:35.420> FG

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
sigma 1 through 6 alt are all tea all FG

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.550 
sigma 1 through 6 alt are all tea all FG
alt<00:02:37.110> Z<00:02:37.500> X<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.400> that's<00:02:39.000> about<00:02:39.180> close<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.230> 50

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
alt Z X so that's about close to 50

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.400 
alt Z X so that's about close to 50
binds<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.100> i<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.370> get<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:42.019> just<00:02:43.019> making
