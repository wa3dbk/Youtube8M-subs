about six out of the champagne that's
not<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.390> good<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.020> mean<00:02:09.649> when<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.100> comes<00:02:10.460> to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
not that good I mean when I comes to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.140 
not that good I mean when I comes to
perfumes<00:02:11.240> I<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:12.080> handle<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:13.070> six-hour<00:02:13.580> window

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150

and then reapply more but with makeup

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.270 
and then reapply more but with makeup
you<00:02:17.660> want<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.080> last<00:02:18.290> at<00:02:18.590> least<00:02:18.620> eight<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280

ten hours and five and six doesn't cut

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.390 
ten hours and five and six doesn't cut
it<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.270> me<00:02:23.450> that's<00:02:23.750> weaksauce<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.890> because

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
it for me that's weaksauce and because

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.920 
it for me that's weaksauce and because
it's<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:25.790> sheer<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.240> doesn't<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:26.660> make

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
it's so sheer it doesn't really make

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.630 
it's so sheer it doesn't really make
your<00:02:27.140> colors<00:02:27.530> brighter<00:02:28.010> when<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.400> apply

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
your colors brighter when you apply

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.670 
your colors brighter when you apply
shadow<00:02:28.970> over<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.930> was<00:02:30.080> also<00:02:30.380> kind<00:02:30.620> of

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
shadow over it so that was also kind of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.680 
shadow over it so that was also kind of
disappointing<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.640> was<00:02:32.270> really<00:02:32.480> excited

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
disappointing I was really excited

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.090 
disappointing I was really excited
