00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.820 
you can I mean I asked the sheriff how
rare<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.569> is<00:02:39.630> obviously<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.230> doesn't<00:02:40.410> happen

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
rare this is obviously it doesn't happen

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.350 
rare this is obviously it doesn't happen
very<00:02:40.980> often<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.489> don't<00:02:41.550> hear<00:02:41.819> about<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.150> type

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
very often we don't hear about this type

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.350 
very often we don't hear about this type
of<00:02:42.390> thing<00:02:42.660> very<00:02:42.690> often<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.819> prompt

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
of thing very often but what can prompt

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.190 
of thing very often but what can prompt
a<00:02:45.510> great<00:02:45.810> white<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:47.130> attack<00:02:48.200> well

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
a great white like this to attack well

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.680 
a great white like this to attack well
certainly<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.700> white<00:02:50.850> shark<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.420> largest

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
certainly the white shark is the largest

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.229 
certainly the white shark is the largest
of<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.049> predatory<00:02:52.500> sharks<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.160> almost<00:02:53.790> 20

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
of the predatory sharks it's almost 20

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.630 
of the predatory sharks it's almost 20
feet<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.569> length<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:56.069> goes<00:02:56.280> after

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
feet in length and so it goes after

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.150 
feet in length and so it goes after
large<00:02:56.850> prey<00:02:57.209> items<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.830> unfortunately<00:02:58.830> once

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
large prey items and unfortunately once

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.120 
large prey items and unfortunately once
in<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.400> while<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> human<00:03:00.060> being<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:01.410> appropriate

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
in a while a human being is appropriate

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.250 
in a while a human being is appropriate
to<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.400> mmm<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.180> perhaps<00:03:03.540> appropriate

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
to that mmm and perhaps appropriate

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.460 
to that mmm and perhaps appropriate
behavior<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.130> draw<00:03:05.730> its<00:03:05.910> interest<00:03:06.470> shark

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
behavior to draw its interest shark

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.949 
behavior to draw its interest shark
attack<00:03:07.799> resulting<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.610> fatalities<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.630> very

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
attack resulting in fatalities is a very

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.530 
attack resulting in fatalities is a very

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.280 
risk that we have to accept as we engage
in<00:03:52.140> this<00:03:52.440> wilderness<00:03:52.680> experience<00:03:54.140> for<00:03:55.140> us

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
in this wilderness experience for us

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.199 
in this wilderness experience for us
there's<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:56.069> not<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.340> great<00:03:56.579> risk<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.120> we

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
there's it's not a great risk and we

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.120 
there's it's not a great risk and we
don't<00:03:57.390> have<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.720> happen<00:03:58.079> too<00:03:58.230> often<00:03:58.440> but

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
don't have this happen too often but

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.400 
don't have this happen too often but
certainly<00:03:59.700> we<00:03:59.790> want<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.090> avoid<00:04:00.329> areas<00:04:00.810> where<00:04:01.380> a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
certainly we want to avoid areas where a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.289 
certainly we want to avoid areas where a
big<00:04:01.620> predators<00:04:02.069> such<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.760> great<00:04:03.030> whites

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
big predators such as the great whites

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.390 
big predators such as the great whites
are<00:04:03.569> common<00:04:03.900> would<00:04:04.680> certainly<00:04:04.890> want<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.160> avoid

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
are common would certainly want to avoid

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.340 
are common would certainly want to avoid
areas<00:04:05.670> where<00:04:05.970> seals<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.540> sea<00:04:06.690> lions<00:04:07.109> are

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
areas where seals and sea lions are

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.559 
areas where seals and sea lions are
hauling<00:04:08.340> out<00:04:08.519> those<00:04:09.000> areas<00:04:09.180> in<00:04:09.420> particular

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
hauling out those areas in particular

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.590 
hauling out those areas in particular
are<00:04:10.560> very<00:04:10.620> good<00:04:11.130> white<00:04:11.370> shark<00:04:11.670> areas<00:04:12.060> yeah<00:04:12.389> how

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
are very good white shark areas yeah how

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.900 
are very good white shark areas yeah how
close<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.350> shore<00:04:13.650> will<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.250> great<00:04:14.519> white

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
close to the shore will a great white

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.050 
close to the shore will a great white
typically<00:04:15.660> swim<00:04:16.440> around<00:04:16.739> or<00:04:17.039> be<00:04:17.190> around<00:04:17.519> then

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
typically swim around or be around then

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.110 
typically swim around or be around then
oh<00:04:18.139> well<00:04:19.139> they<00:04:19.260> certainly<00:04:19.859> into<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.910> Surrey

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
oh well they certainly into the Surrey

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.440 
oh well they certainly into the Surrey
stone<00:04:21.620> with<00:04:22.620> some<00:04:22.830> frequency<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.970> they

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
stone with some frequency and and they

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.390 
stone with some frequency and and they
keep<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.810> mind<00:04:25.020> if<00:04:25.440> you're<00:04:25.800> going<00:04:25.889> to<00:04:25.980> go<00:04:26.100> chase
