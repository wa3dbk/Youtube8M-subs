00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.910 
of it is I was finally able to access my
Power<00:00:20.340> Commander<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> needed<00:00:22.529> was

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
Power Commander and what I needed was

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.390 
Power Commander and what I needed was
the<00:00:23.340> software<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.949> which<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.220> turn

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the software to do it which you can turn

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.769 
the software to do it which you can turn
which<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.910> download<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.539> power

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
which you can download from power

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.380 
which you can download from power
commander's<00:00:28.320> website<00:00:28.910> but<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> needed<00:00:30.179> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
commander's website but I needed this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.680 
commander's website but I needed this
cable<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.920> power<00:00:32.160> commander<00:00:32.759> that's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
cable because the power commander that's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.520 
cable because the power commander that's
in<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.260> PC<00:00:34.620> 3<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> PC<00:00:36.300> 3<00:00:36.510> USB<00:00:36.930> it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
in it's a PC 3 it's not a PC 3 USB it's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.770 
in it's a PC 3 it's not a PC 3 USB it's
just<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.219> PC<00:00:39.059> 3<00:00:39.410> which<00:00:40.410> connects<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.820> serial

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
just a PC 3 which connects with a serial

just a PC 3 which connects with a serial
cable<00:00:43.520> well<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.550> dare<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> find<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.840> computer

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
cable well I dare you to find a computer

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
cable well I dare you to find a computer
that<00:00:46.530> comes<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.980> serial<00:00:47.340> connections<00:00:47.820> man

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that comes with serial connections man

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.260 
that comes with serial connections man
they<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.420> don't<00:00:48.629> happen<00:00:49.280> well<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.149> they

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
they just don't happen well and if they

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.920 
they just don't happen well and if they
do<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> monitor<00:00:52.140> port<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.629> had<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> go

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
do it's a monitor port so I had to go

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.170 
do it's a monitor port so I had to go
buy<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.820> cable<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.960> convert<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.210> serial<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.449> USB

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
buy a cable to convert the serial to USB

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
buy a cable to convert the serial to USB
which<00:01:03.180> isn't<00:01:03.390> hard<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> find<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.949> not

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
which isn't hard to find and it's not

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740 
which isn't hard to find and it's not
they're<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.460> expensive<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> cost<00:01:06.630> me

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
they're not expensive I think it cost me

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.039 
they're not expensive I think it cost me
like<00:01:06.780> 8<00:01:07.260> bucks<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.659> matter<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like 8 bucks but it's just a matter of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.679 
like 8 bucks but it's just a matter of
having<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.100> time<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> find<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.479> get

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
having the time to find one and go get

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
having the time to find one and go get
it<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> then<00:01:13.170> having<00:01:13.380> access<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.130> bike

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it and then having access to the bike

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390 
it and then having access to the bike
and<00:01:14.640> yadda<00:01:14.790> yadda<00:01:14.909> yadda<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.189> day<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
went and I got one and the problem with

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.999 
went and I got one and the problem with
this<00:01:20.310> thing<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> way<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.320> when<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.650> bought

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
this thing the way it was when I bought

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.359 
this thing the way it was when I bought
it<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.600> guy<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:25.229> remapped<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
it is the guy had remapped it and I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.399 
it is the guy had remapped it and I
don't<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.060> used<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.420> dyno<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.960> remap

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
don't know if they used a dyno to remap

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.760 
don't know if they used a dyno to remap
it<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:30.000> honestly<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it or not I honestly don't think so the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
it or not I honestly don't think so the
guy<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.850> Speed<00:01:33.509> Racer

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
guy was a little bit of a Speed Racer

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.130 
guy was a little bit of a Speed Racer
type<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:35.759> think<00:01:36.119> he<00:01:36.509> went<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.840> found<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
type and I think he went and found a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
type and I think he went and found a
really<00:01:37.439> hot<00:01:37.650> map<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.549> make<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:38.909> really

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
really hot map to make it go really

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.840 
really hot map to make it go really
really<00:01:39.299> fast<00:01:39.920> but<00:01:40.920> didn't<00:01:41.189> actually<00:01:41.310> put<00:01:41.670> any

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
really fast but didn't actually put any

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.130 
really fast but didn't actually put any
effort<00:01:41.970> into<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:44.329> this<00:01:45.329> bike<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
effort into it and this bike with the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.100 
effort into it and this bike with the
factory<00:01:46.860> settings<00:01:47.399> stutters<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.540> stumbles

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
factory settings stutters and stumbles

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
factory settings stutters and stumbles
on<00:01:49.259> itself<00:01:49.649> at<00:01:49.979> low<00:01:50.250> speeds<00:01:50.640> especially<00:01:51.240> with

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
on itself at low speeds especially with

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.410 
on itself at low speeds especially with
low<00:01:51.659> rpm<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.850> were<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> just

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
low rpm like right now if I were to just

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
low rpm like right now if I were to just
barely<00:01:54.840> crack<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> throttle<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.640> just

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
barely crack the throttle and just just

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.999 
barely crack the throttle and just just
to<00:01:56.939> go<00:01:57.119> from<00:01:57.270> 39<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.930> 12<00:01:58.530> from<00:01:58.619> 36<00:01:59.490> up<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.360> 38<00:02:01.009> it

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
to go from 39 to 12 from 36 up to 38 it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.580 
to go from 39 to 12 from 36 up to 38 it
would<00:02:02.280> stutter<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.820> itself<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> fall

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
would stutter on itself and kind of fall

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.399

that<00:03:55.260> gets<00:03:55.859> rid<00:03:56.099> of<00:03:56.129> this<00:03:56.340> low<00:03:56.579> speed<00:03:56.879> stumble

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
that gets rid of this low speed stumble

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.159 
that gets rid of this low speed stumble
and<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.900> also<00:03:58.879> makes<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.060> VTEC<00:04:00.510> transition

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
and it also makes the VTEC transition

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.970 
and it also makes the VTEC transition
almost<00:04:01.769> unnoticeable

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
almost unnoticeable

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.809 
almost unnoticeable
and<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:05.569> was<00:04:05.690> like<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.959> God<00:04:06.260> said<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:07.220> power

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
and it was like the God said to power

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.680 
and it was like the God said to power
commander<00:04:08.390> bikes<00:04:09.459> because<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:10.700> doesn't<00:04:11.090> it

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
commander bikes because it doesn't it

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.830 
commander bikes because it doesn't it
might<00:04:12.049> make<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.349> few<00:04:12.530> extra<00:04:12.950> horsepower<00:04:13.840> but

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
might make a few extra horsepower but

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.590 
might make a few extra horsepower but
it's<00:04:14.900> not<00:04:15.170> meant<00:04:15.349> for<00:04:15.470> performance<00:04:16.310> in<00:04:16.600> that

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
it's not meant for performance in that

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.840 
it's not meant for performance in that
respect<00:04:18.260> it's<00:04:18.680> meant<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:18.979> make<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.430> nicer

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
respect it's meant to make it a nicer

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.560 
respect it's meant to make it a nicer
bike<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:22.040> wanted<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:22.669> map<00:04:22.880> on<00:04:23.120> this<00:04:23.300> thing

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
bike and I wanted this map on this thing

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.719 
bike and I wanted this map on this thing
but<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.470> couldn't<00:04:24.770> do<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:24.949> well<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.250> finally<00:04:25.580> got

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
but I couldn't do it well I finally got

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.840 
but I couldn't do it well I finally got
that<00:04:25.970> cable<00:04:26.389> why<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:26.900> got<00:04:27.260> dark<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:28.100> finally<00:04:28.729> got

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
that cable why I got dark I finally got

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.920 
that cable why I got dark I finally got
that<00:04:29.000> cable<00:04:29.419> and<00:04:30.199> I<00:04:30.560> went<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.600> hooked<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.810> up

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
that cable and I went and hooked it up

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.330 
that cable and I went and hooked it up
to<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.199> bike<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.410> couldn't<00:04:33.919> figure<00:04:34.040> out<00:04:34.130> how<00:04:34.310> to

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
to the bike I couldn't figure out how to

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.840 
to the bike I couldn't figure out how to
work<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.760> software<00:04:36.070> because<00:04:37.070> it's<00:04:37.250> not<00:04:37.460> very

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
work the software because it's not very

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.740 
work the software because it's not very
intuitive<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:40.490> kind<00:04:41.389> of<00:04:41.449> said<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.660> know

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
intuitive and I kind of said you know

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.820 
intuitive and I kind of said you know
what<00:04:41.960> I'm<00:04:42.139> just<00:04:42.289> gonna<00:04:42.380> call<00:04:42.590> tech<00:04:42.800> support

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
what I'm just gonna call tech support

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.029 
what I'm just gonna call tech support
later<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:44.630> searched<00:04:45.050> around<00:04:45.260> on<00:04:45.620> their<00:04:45.770> site

works and what the numbers mean which

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.820 
works and what the numbers mean which
was<00:05:54.750> another<00:05:55.080> question<00:05:55.500> that<00:05:55.530> I<00:05:55.680> had<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:58.110> he

detection port lasted like two minutes
and<00:06:04.140> I<00:06:04.170> was<00:06:04.230> like<00:06:04.380> okay<00:06:04.740> cool<00:06:05.010> so<00:06:05.730> I'll<00:06:05.790> go<00:06:05.940> out

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
and hook the computer back up and I load

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.950 
and hook the computer back up and I load
up<00:06:07.770> the<00:06:08.040> math<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.520> do<00:06:09.240> everything<00:06:09.510> he<00:06:09.690> told<00:06:09.900> me

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
up the math and do everything he told me

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.340 
up the math and do everything he told me
to<00:06:10.050> do<00:06:10.170> it

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.570 
poof I've got all the information for
the<00:06:15.840> map<00:06:16.050> that's<00:06:16.260> already<00:06:16.530> on<00:06:16.800> it<00:06:16.980> in<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.430> map

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
the map that's already on it in the map

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.190 
the map that's already on it in the map
that<00:06:17.610> I<00:06:17.820> want<00:06:18.000> to<00:06:18.090> load<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.630> can<00:06:18.780> compare

that I want to load and you can compare

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.520 
that I want to load and you can compare
them<00:06:19.350> and<00:06:19.530> it's<00:06:19.890> got<00:06:20.010> all<00:06:20.040> this<00:06:20.280> nifty<00:06:20.490> shit

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
and it worked so I'll put on the new map

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.970 
and it worked so I'll put on the new map
and<00:06:26.970> I<00:06:27.000> took<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.330> out<00:06:27.390> for<00:06:27.600> a<00:06:27.630> spin<00:06:27.870> and<00:06:28.770> you

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
and I took it out for a spin and you

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.820 
and I took it out for a spin and you
know<00:06:29.100> it's<00:06:29.250> like<00:06:29.540> fucking<00:06:30.620> 2530<00:06:31.620> degrees

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
know it's like fucking 2530 degrees

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.590 
know it's like fucking 2530 degrees
outside<00:06:32.220> such<00:06:32.670> went<00:06:32.910> around<00:06:33.030> the<00:06:33.150> block<00:06:33.270> real

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
outside such went around the block real

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.490 
outside such went around the block real
quick<00:06:33.810> and<00:06:34.160> the<00:06:35.160> low-speed<00:06:35.910> handling<00:06:36.500> issues

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
quick and the low-speed handling issues

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.160 
quick and the low-speed handling issues
were<00:06:37.800> completely<00:06:38.280> solved<00:06:38.880> it's<00:06:39.510> totally<00:06:40.020> gone

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
were completely solved it's totally gone

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.150 
were completely solved it's totally gone
now<00:06:40.940> and<00:06:41.940> in<00:06:42.450> the<00:06:43.200> running<00:06:43.440> around<00:06:43.650> I've<00:06:43.980> done

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
now and in the running around I've done

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.040 
now and in the running around I've done
today<00:06:44.340> which<00:06:44.910> admittedly<00:06:45.510> hasn't<00:06:45.930> been<00:06:46.020> a

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
today which admittedly hasn't been a

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
today which admittedly hasn't been a
whole<00:06:46.230> lot<00:06:49.070> there<00:06:50.070> the<00:06:50.970> VTEC<00:06:51.390> transition<00:06:52.070> has

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
whole lot there the VTEC transition has

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.760 
whole lot there the VTEC transition has
been<00:06:53.340> completely<00:06:53.880> unnoticeable

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
been completely unnoticeable

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.710 
been completely unnoticeable
and<00:06:55.860> it's<00:06:56.580> all<00:06:56.789> because<00:06:57.000> of<00:06:57.180> the<00:06:57.330> way<00:06:57.509> they

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
and it's all because of the way they

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.779 
and it's all because of the way they
changed<00:06:58.139> the<00:06:58.259> fuel<00:06:58.560> map<00:06:58.770> on<00:06:58.949> the<00:06:59.069> signature<00:06:59.550> oh

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
changed the fuel map on the signature oh

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.320 
changed the fuel map on the signature oh
it's<00:07:00.150> it's<00:07:00.360> beautiful<00:07:00.690> I<00:07:01.110> mean<00:07:01.289> it<00:07:01.500> really<00:07:01.710> is

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
I'm gonna get slightly better gas

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.930 
I'm gonna get slightly better gas
mileage<00:07:06.030> because<00:07:06.979> the<00:07:07.979> old<00:07:08.159> map<00:07:08.430> that<00:07:08.669> was<00:07:08.759> on

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
mileage because the old map that was on

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.760 
mileage because the old map that was on
it<00:07:09.090> had<00:07:09.270> some<00:07:09.479> really<00:07:09.659> atrociously<00:07:10.440> high

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
it had some really atrociously high

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.890 
it had some really atrociously high
numbers<00:07:11.250> it's<00:07:12.120> just<00:07:12.300> like<00:07:12.449> Jesus<00:07:13.050> Christ<00:07:13.470> man

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
numbers it's just like Jesus Christ man

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.879

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
yeah this is not a fucking this isn't a

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:21.529 
yeah this is not a fucking this isn't a
track<00:07:19.889> bike<00:07:20.159> you<00:07:20.490> know<00:07:20.639> you<00:07:20.729> can<00:07:21.000> turn<00:07:21.270> it<00:07:21.389> into

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
track bike you know you can turn it into

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.600 
track bike you know you can turn it into
one<00:07:21.780> if<00:07:21.900> you<00:07:21.990> want<00:07:22.289> but<00:07:22.680> you're<00:07:23.280> gonna<00:07:23.370> need<00:07:23.550> to

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
one if you want but you're gonna need to

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.730 
one if you want but you're gonna need to
do<00:07:23.909> a<00:07:23.940> lot<00:07:24.150> more<00:07:24.210> than<00:07:24.599> just<00:07:24.870> put<00:07:25.139> new<00:07:25.319> mufflers

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
do a lot more than just put new mufflers

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.089 
do a lot more than just put new mufflers
on<00:07:25.949> it<00:07:26.129> and<00:07:26.220> change<00:07:26.400> the<00:07:26.639> map<00:07:27.770> but<00:07:28.770> it<00:07:28.889> was

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 
on it and change the map but it was

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:32.839 
on it and change the map but it was
getting<00:07:29.520> like<00:07:30.440> 30<00:07:31.440> miles<00:07:31.830> to<00:07:32.159> the<00:07:32.250> gallon<00:07:32.460> yes

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:32.849 
getting like 30 miles to the gallon yes

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:36.409 
getting like 30 miles to the gallon yes
is<00:07:33.030> eat<00:07:33.389> gas<00:07:33.840> alive<00:07:34.319> and<00:07:35.190> it's<00:07:36.000> not<00:07:36.150> doing<00:07:36.389> that

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 
is eat gas alive and it's not doing that

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:37.490 
is eat gas alive and it's not doing that
anymore

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
anymore

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.710 
anymore
I<00:07:37.530> don't<00:07:37.919> think<00:07:37.979> it's<00:07:38.550> certainly<00:07:39.090> the<00:07:39.210> from

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 
I don't think it's certainly the from

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.180 
I don't think it's certainly the from
watching<00:07:40.020> the<00:07:40.080> gas<00:07:40.289> gauge<00:07:40.560> over<00:07:40.889> the<00:07:41.009> last

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.190 
watching the gas gauge over the last

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:47.029 
watching the gas gauge over the last
hour<00:07:41.460> it<00:07:42.300> seems<00:07:42.569> a<00:07:42.659> lot<00:07:42.840> better<00:07:44.569> so<00:07:45.710> so<00:07:46.710> far<00:07:46.889> I'm

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 
hour it seems a lot better so so far I'm

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:51.320 
hour it seems a lot better so so far I'm
pretty<00:07:47.219> happy<00:07:47.430> with<00:07:47.669> it<00:07:47.729> and<00:07:50.270> it's<00:07:51.270> just

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.330 
pretty happy with it and it's just

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.320 
pretty happy with it and it's just
things<00:07:51.599> are<00:07:51.690> just<00:07:51.870> going<00:07:51.990> fairly<00:07:52.229> well<00:07:52.380> I

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330 
things are just going fairly well I

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.300 
things are just going fairly well I
