00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.480
 and then staff and solid youtube 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.830
 received here as samsung galaxy tab 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.120
 I've already been there and inverted pro 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.270
 321 not 2014 night 10 thousand and 14 for you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.430
 such a p-61 come on let's do the test of the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.320
 marking year alright I've ever had 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.689
 previously rotated with another 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.760
 performance device made thesis 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.039
 This one I did not steal I'm still going to roll 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.859
 now the performance test the first 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.280
 Let's turn the two together here to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.090
 know how much is the performance of a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.969
 on the other side there are two together we will see 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 I'm not online 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.000
 neither for one nor for another is that name 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.620
 I do not think the two are in the same 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.530
 version hopefully nÃ© 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 then the test would be fairer. 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.050
 problem of good that not all that good 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.989
 Mark the staff speaks that it is samsung a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.300
 exceed the ipad date to do with a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.330
 other I can usually do a lot 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.830
 It is okay that you check independently of the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.740
 device 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.900
 okay let's see here as the skirt 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.450
 performance of each one I saw 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.420
 performance already said here on the internet 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.509
 They already see videos in English. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.729
 I found very high performance let's see 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.150
 if it is going to have the same performance is 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.030
 there in the note 2014 is also very high 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.520
 personal performance I have here my 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.329
 not s4 also runs the year well that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.640
 mark 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.119
 I always leave everything whenever I have a 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 new version of the spinning act i do one 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:49.100
 test again my s4 gave 29 1234 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.140
 Let's see how others do. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:58.320
 honey is a quad core 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:02.280
 I do not remember how many 4 I do not see 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.829
 settings ds4 and ds5 there has seems 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.119
 that he leaves 35 thousand something like that does not 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.580
 not so good martin 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.649
 Let's start getting into the graphics part 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.310
 now from 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.590
 the test lets go to 70% 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.489
 it looks like the tab for him is in front 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.159
 a little bit in front of the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.310
 android robozinho 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:31.140
 the two seem to be very fast in the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.290
 part here is part 2 of much 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.239
 soft oo chart here also looks like 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:48.090
 a little faster in the notw 2014 goes 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:51.000
 pro 3d test now ps3 of very soft 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.420
 Hurry up, you 're giving it to me too. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.569
 how much 43 44 46 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.109
 the good fight 5050 honey is practically 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.159
 are running the same fps the same 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.159
 two videos here 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:13.760
 running very smooth a performance 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:20.690
 very good of the two personal devices 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:32.629
 11 now in the end finishing here 35 thousand 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:36.840
 685 and here 33 1926 small 35 thousand 685 33 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.470
 926 my incredible highest first place 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.639
 It's a good year, mark that spent the night 3 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:49.019
 35 000 685 congratulations there is gone even if 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:55.229
 this score is to be congratulated and the tab 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 o note 2014 33 926 I have here the 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.750
 other tests I did I have here 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.010
 a historic agreement he made 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.099
 previously 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:12.209
 previously he did 33 598 33 611 7133 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:15.569
 380 that is a very does not escape around it 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:19.500
 there and this one won in two thousand more 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.380
 points on the benchmark axis v 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.520
 Details 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:29.169
 let me see that in the tale 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.729
 even we will see here cpu is that in 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.960
 2014 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:40.710
 it is a cpu of a quad core of 1.9 and 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.710
 here the cpu is a quad core of 2,265,274 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.400
 330 and here the mali 628 honey gives a 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.430
 very good performance 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.030
 the resolution is the same for both 1,600 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.720
 for 2,560 they have had almost the same 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.990
 the same score and this is very good 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.940
 people very fast this tablet here 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.590
 one of the reasons I chose this 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.349
 tablet is because of his processor 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.000
 which is very fast and I was among him 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.460
 and the lg pad 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.330
 The LG had the performance was not as 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.220
 good like this 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.310
 but the graphical interface is very cool 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.440
 lg is using on 8.3 tablet 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.080
 inches but I ended up opting for it 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.879
 by the processor to be faster and by 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.979
 graphical interface will also have a 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.729
 difference and try to change the 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:33.460
 graphical interface that Samsung made 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.740
 Very good, let's see what 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.940
 He talks here to your wrong click. 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.990
 here the messina is wonderful, that's it 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.729
 good guys 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.800
 if you liked and the test of 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.289
 performance of the two of the two 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.000
 devices, let me come, please 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.620
 Okay, do not forget to also enjoy the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.710
 facebook and twitter 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.630
 in g further google plans to leave 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.889
 Streets and videos are good people then 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.199
 This is if you liked your young 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.550
 left a message thank you and see you later 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.550
 staff spoke
