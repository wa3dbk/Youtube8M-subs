they leave the skull in this tutorial
you<00:00:14.309> will<00:00:14.340> consider<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> nerves

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you will consider the nerves

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.620 
you will consider the nerves
individually<00:00:15.929> or<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> small<00:00:16.740> groups

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.090 

to<00:00:20.630> assess<00:00:20.870> the<00:00:20.990> olfactory<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.620> ask<00:00:21.860> the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
to assess the olfactory and ask the

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.740 
to assess the olfactory and ask the
patient<00:00:22.250> have<00:00:23.000> you<00:00:23.060> had<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.180> change<00:00:23.450> in<00:00:23.600> your

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
patient have you had a change in your

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.490 
patient have you had a change in your
sense<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:24.110> smell<00:00:24.320> taste<00:00:24.740> recently<00:00:25.510> very<00:00:26.510> good

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.950 

the<00:00:30.370> optic<00:00:30.640> nerve<00:00:30.850> we're<00:00:31.480> going<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:31.720> assess

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
the optic nerve we're going to assess

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.140 
the optic nerve we're going to assess
visual<00:00:32.260> acuity<00:00:32.470> visual<00:00:32.890> fields<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:33.850> then

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
visual acuity visual fields and then

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.300 
visual acuity visual fields and then
you'd<00:00:34.300> perform<00:00:34.480> a<00:00:34.810> philosophy<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:36.160> if<00:00:36.220> a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
you'd perform a philosophy so if a

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.370 
you'd perform a philosophy so if a
visual<00:00:36.610> acuity<00:00:36.850> but<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.720> asked<00:00:37.900> you<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.200> cover

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
visual acuity but I asked you to cover

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.590 
visual acuity but I asked you to cover
your<00:00:38.560> right<00:00:38.680> eye<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.100> can<00:00:39.940> you<00:00:40.030> read<00:00:40.180> as<00:00:40.360> far

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
your right eye and can you read as far

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.100 
your right eye and can you read as far
down<00:00:40.630> on<00:00:40.930> that<00:00:41.020> child's<00:00:41.350> possible<00:00:41.740> in<00:00:43.110> Casey

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
down on that child's possible in Casey

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.990 
down on that child's possible in Casey
and<00:00:44.410> are<00:00:44.590> very<00:00:45.310> good<00:00:45.460> if<00:00:45.610> you<00:00:45.700> could<00:00:45.820> do<00:00:45.910> the

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
and are very good if you could do the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.680 
and are very good if you could do the
same<00:00:46.120> with<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.330> other<00:00:46.420> one

now very good now very good and you
would<00:01:40.930> do<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.170> same<00:01:41.350> with<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.620> other<00:01:41.770> eye<00:01:41.800> and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
would do the same with the other eye and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.150 
would do the same with the other eye and
then<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.060> perform<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.480> philosophy

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.620 

now<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.220> cranial<00:01:48.670> nerves<00:01:48.910> three<00:01:49.330> four<00:01:49.510> and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
now the cranial nerves three four and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.480 
now the cranial nerves three four and
six<00:01:49.870> we're<00:01:50.170> going<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.530> test<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:51.100> pupillary

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
six we're going to test the pupillary

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.520 
six we're going to test the pupillary
light<00:01:51.640> reflex<00:01:51.820> errs<00:01:52.420> both<00:01:52.960> direct<00:01:53.410> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
light reflex errs both direct and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530 
light reflex errs both direct and
contralateral<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.880> accommodation<00:01:55.390> reflex

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
contralateral the accommodation reflex

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.450 
contralateral the accommodation reflex
and<00:01:56.020> then<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.530> function<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.040> extraocular

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
and then the function of the extraocular

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.820 
and then the function of the extraocular
muscles<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.930> for<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> direct

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
muscles so for the direct

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.010 
muscles so for the direct
pupillary<00:02:00.520> light<00:02:00.790> reflex<00:02:00.940> collages<00:02:01.690> ask<00:02:01.900> you

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
pupillary light reflex collages ask you

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.220 
pupillary light reflex collages ask you
to<00:02:02.140> look<00:02:02.260> into<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.590> distance<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.990> just

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
to look into the distance and I'm just

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.639 
to look into the distance and I'm just
going<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.470> shine<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.890> torch<00:02:05.920> like<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:07.060> and

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
going to shine the torch like so and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.660 
going to shine the torch like so and
there<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.770> can<00:02:08.890> see<00:02:09.040> a<00:02:09.070> slight<00:02:09.399> constriction

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
there you can see a slight constriction

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.090 
there you can see a slight constriction
of<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.450> pupil<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.110> was<00:02:11.230> abnormal<00:02:11.500> direct

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
of the pupil that was abnormal direct

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.300 
of the pupil that was abnormal direct
light<00:02:12.250> reflex<00:02:12.610> next<00:02:13.300> for<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.570> contralateral

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
light reflex next for the contralateral

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.990 
light reflex next for the contralateral
reflex<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.350> eye<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:18.460> just<00:02:18.670> assessing

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
reflex on this eye and it just assessing

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.640 
reflex on this eye and it just assessing
the<00:02:19.450> same<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.690> present<00:02:23.170> they<00:02:23.350> are<00:02:23.380> very

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
the same and it is present they are very

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.810 
the same and it is present they are very
good<00:02:23.830> just<00:02:24.070> relaxing
