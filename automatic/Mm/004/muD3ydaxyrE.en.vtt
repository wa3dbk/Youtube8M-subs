that<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> map<00:02:19.010> was<00:02:19.220> my<00:02:19.370> best<00:02:19.520> because<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.910> is

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
that the map was my best because it is

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.240 
that the map was my best because it is
one<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.330> my<00:02:20.390> best<00:02:20.690> instead<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.680> me<00:02:21.830> missing<00:02:22.100> the

can't<00:02:48.680> see<00:02:48.890> anything<00:02:49.130> move<00:02:49.790> out<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.060> way<00:02:50.090> I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
can't see anything move out of the way I

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.910 
can't see anything move out of the way I
don't<00:02:50.840> want<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.020> leave<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.380> don't<00:02:51.440> want<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:51.830> use

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
don't want to leave I don't want to use

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.110 
don't want to leave I don't want to use
my<00:02:52.100> leap<00:02:52.370> thing<00:02:52.580> because<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.820> don't<00:02:52.880> know<00:02:53.000> how

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
my leap thing because I don't know how

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.610 
my leap thing because I don't know how
to<00:02:53.180> freakin<00:02:53.480> use<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.780> okay<00:02:54.290> well<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.560> looks

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
to freakin use it okay well it looks

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.690 
to freakin use it okay well it looks
like<00:02:54.740> we're<00:02:54.890> gonna<00:02:54.980> have<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.160> use<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.310> okay<00:02:55.670> I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
like we're gonna have to use it okay I

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.040 
like we're gonna have to use it okay I
can't<00:02:55.970> use<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.300> another<00:02:56.450> seven<00:02:56.780> seconds

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
can't use it for another seven seconds

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.210 
can't use it for another seven seconds
so<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.200> doesn't<00:02:57.410> really<00:02:57.500> make<00:02:57.650> sense<00:02:57.710> but<00:02:58.010> okay

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
so it doesn't really make sense but okay

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.900 
so it doesn't really make sense but okay
go<00:02:59.150> go<00:02:59.720> go<00:03:00.380> can<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.950> use<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.100> now<00:03:01.280> gonna<00:03:01.610> use<00:03:01.790> it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
go go go can I use it now gonna use it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.230 
go go go can I use it now gonna use it
now

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
now

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.150 
now
no<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.930> point<00:03:03.140> five<00:03:03.380> seconds<00:03:03.800> no<00:03:04.010> it's

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
no it's a point five seconds no it's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.710 
no it's a point five seconds no it's
another<00:03:04.370> seven<00:03:04.700> seconds<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.390> doesn't<00:03:05.660> make

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
another seven seconds that doesn't make

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.370 
another seven seconds that doesn't make
sense

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
sense

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.690

there's<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.830> many<00:05:10.010> people<00:05:10.700> but<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.150> did<00:05:11.390> figure

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
there's so many people but I did figure

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.240
