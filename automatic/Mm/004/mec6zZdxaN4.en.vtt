00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.960
 hello friends with you dmitry file and 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.440
 Today we are in Astrakhan 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.500
 areas 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.629
 the next will be ours actually today 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 I would like to tell you what you need with you 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.050
 take a long journey 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.050
 to feel confident 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.070
 I like many of you very much 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.200
 travel and in my car I 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.150
 driving more than one thousand kilometers 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.640
 throughout Russia very often 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.890
 I travel abroad where 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.440
 come across different situations on 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.229
 the road is the first thing that is necessary 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.330
 Of course, bring a first aid kit and she 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.800
 there must be a complete first aid kit with 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.440
 by which I simply pass 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.780
 checkup and otmazyvatsya from the cops 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.820
 but surely as in any arsenal 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.550
 a good driver should be big 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.770
 first aid kit and in my first aid kit there is all the most 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.220
 required that you may need in 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.080
 the roads need to know which 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.450
 drugs needed for this need 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.770
 consult a good doctor 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.810
 traveling in different regions of Russia 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.330
 often stopped involuntary 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.390
 witness different road situations 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.880
 it often happened that the driver ran out 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.979
 his car lit up fire extinguishers nearby 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.350
 It was not therefore all car owners I 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.640
 I recommend to take on the road 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.539
 large and reliable proven 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.000
 fire extinguishers in my car 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.490
 fire extinguisher rather average volume 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.119
 but repeatedly he saved me in such 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.110
 situations I helped other people always 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.660
 I have with me 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.940
 warning triangle he helps 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.430
 label yourself on the road in case 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.319
 car breakdowns on the track in various 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.630
 corners of Russia is unknown when you 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.130
 will meet the next refueling therefore 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.319
 you must always have with you 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.000
 emergency fuel supply and in my 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.190
 trunk are expeditionary 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.230
 cans it is very convenient since 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.990
 takes up little space and you can 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.610
 put any bag or suitcase in 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.110
 set of any car owner 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.720
 you must have with you 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.630
 necessary fluid that is poured 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.040
 in the car namely antifreeze oil in 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.810
 engine power steering fluid 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.349
 steering automatic transmission and 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.209
 brake fluid 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.220
 because different situations can 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.170
 happen on the road this fluid is not 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.940
 you will definitely need it 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.890
 need someone else on the road 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.290
 but in the same way when it can help 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.750
 do not forget you before any trip 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.510
 check stock availability as well as her 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.580
 condition 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.459
 be sure to put the jack and balloon 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.709
 key in the trunk of your car 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.090
 I recommend to take a mobile 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.879
 repair kits that will eliminate 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.370
 puncture right on the road in my hands 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.440
 there are patches and so -called 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.200
 flagella any car owner can 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.000
 fix the puncture for 5 minutes 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.400
 fix the puncture is not all you need 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.060
 pump up the wheel and for that in my 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.730
 the trunk 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.560
 there is a compressor it is enough 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.959
 powerful allows you to do this quickly 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.000
 when you buy a compressor on the road 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.069
 do not be stingy buy only 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.139
 proven brand compressor should 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.730
 produce at least seventy two liters 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.450
 per minute 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.970
 especially for SUV owners 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.819
 This is important as the wheels on our 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.560
 The car is very large volume 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.359
 guys if you are driving away necessarily 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.480
 take the drive belts on the road 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:00.799
 and do not forget to check their status 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.060
 off road dirt 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.980
 impassable swamps many love 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.440
 travel and love extreme pour not 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.459
 often we get stuck and sometimes just 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.650
 the car stalled 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.079
 you may need help sometimes 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.780
 you can help someone and always in my 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.590
 There are various car for this case 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.709
 devices 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.419
 there is just an ordinary cable which 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.430
 allows 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.860
 tow a car as well 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.270
 dynamic sling in this case it 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.479
 professional dynamic sling 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.030
 which jerk allows you to pull out 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.340
 the car is even twice as large 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.199
 a lot of my car on many 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.830
 prepared off-road vehicles installed 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.680
 winch 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.800
 but we take care of nature and in my 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.650
 special protective trunk soon 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.900
 sling she allows you to save the bark 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.120
 wood safe and sound 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.370
 And now I want to tell you. 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.590
 the most important about the tool 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.050
 I love him very much and in my trunk 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.849
 very much almost whole 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.849
 car repair shop is in this 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.070
 box but there are things that need 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.080
 have every car owner going 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.539
 long journey do not forget your 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.390
 tool box to put the wires for 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.960
 lighting up 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.410
 they should be long and enough 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.720
 good quality do not save on it 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.430
 because they may be needed 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.560
 it often happens that the battery 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.560
 we land at zero or music 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.780
 did they listen to the light in general they 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.870
 need happens and we and our friends and 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.060
 just someone on the road do not save on 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.070
 this thing is sure to buy a set 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.680
 keys 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.200
 screwdriver head pliers pliers and 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.080
 hammer is minimal things which 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.850
 you will always need as you know 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.980
 modern cars are stuffed 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.020
 electronics all circuits are protected 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.270
 fuses they definitely need 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.100
 put on the road but not every 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.980
 knows where the minute is from 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.800
 blown fuse so for 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.020
 all of our customers we have a telephone 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.730
 hotline support and if available 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.040
 the minimum set of tools about 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.320
 which I mentioned you can on the road 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.550

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.890
 and help to do it 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.220
 I visit such corners 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.330
 where there is no simple electricity in order 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.020
 just to bring water to the camp 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.949
 turn on the light bulb 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:34.699
 finally make warm in a tent in my 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:36.470
 An inverter is installed in the trunk 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.930
 produces three and a half kilowatt 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.090
 electric having a simple extension cord 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.130
 straight from the trunk can be stretched 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.380
 electricity anywhere you go 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.710
 only need in order to 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.930
 the system is installed in my trunk 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.960
 car worked smoothly i 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.789
 installed 2 gel batteries as well 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.580
 set an additional alarm 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:00.979
 which voltage reduction gets 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.139
 automatic car and allows 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.970
 recharge both our batteries 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.240
 The campground is located near 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.880
 small river and the presence of the outlet helps 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.940
 connect and fridge and light bulb 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.620
 also allows 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.199
 extract water directly from the river we 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:22.070
 we connect the pump and we do not have it 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:24.260
 wearing a bucket it really helps me to everyone 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.840
 I recommend to put my cars 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.639
