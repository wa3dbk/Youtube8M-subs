the<00:02:40.670> difference<00:02:41.060> between<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.840> lot<00:02:42.019> of

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
the difference between I know a lot of

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.509 
the difference between I know a lot of
people<00:02:42.790> used<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.880> take<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.269> BSN<00:02:44.989> syntha-6

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519

what's<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.640> difference<00:02:46.970> between<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.390> V

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
what's the difference between the V

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.710 
what's the difference between the V
Corps<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.080> like<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.349> syntha-6<00:02:48.680> for<00:02:49.130> example

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
Corps and like the syntha-6 for example

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.080 
Corps and like the syntha-6 for example
right<00:02:50.720> here<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:55.250> gonna<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.700> whey

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
right here it's gonna have a whey

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.759 
right here it's gonna have a whey

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
isolate blend instead of a weight

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.259 
isolate blend instead of a weight
concentrate<00:02:58.459> blend<00:02:58.760> now<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.030> still<00:02:59.120> gonna

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
concentrate blend now it's still gonna

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.130
