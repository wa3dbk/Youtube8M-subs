corresponds to the description on the
left<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> but<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.120> animate<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.379> need

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
left and but to animate these you need

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.740 
left and but to animate these you need
to<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> auto<00:01:02.340> keyframe<00:01:02.910> button<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.359> as

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you see was turned orange so then you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
you see was turned orange so then you
can<00:01:07.080> move<00:01:07.229> forward<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.939> move

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
can move forward so that's not move

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
can move forward so that's not move
forward<00:01:09.720> set<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> 100<00:01:10.799> move<00:01:11.400> back<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> set

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
forward set it to 100 move back and set

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
forward set it to 100 move back and set
it<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.299> naught<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.260> we've

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it to naught so then there we go we've

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
it to naught so then there we go we've
got<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.650> nice<00:01:13.890> blink<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.540> see<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
got a nice blink and as you can see the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.030 
got a nice blink and as you can see the
slider<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.710> animating<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> right<00:01:19.040> there

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
slider it's animating on the right there

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.800 
slider it's animating on the right there
we<00:01:20.130> go<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.060> checked<00:01:21.240> off<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
we go and then you just checked off and
then<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.140> still<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.159> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.639 
around and if you don't know what they
do<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:52.259> move<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.390> shoulder<00:01:54.390> wrist<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
do is they move the shoulder wrist and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.609 
do is they move the shoulder wrist and
elbow<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> same<00:01:56.880> time<00:01:57.320> which<00:01:58.320> just

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
elbow all at the same time which just

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.649 
elbow all at the same time which just
helps<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.009> create<00:01:59.130> smoother<00:01:59.790> more<00:01:59.969> realistic

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
helps to create smoother more realistic

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.880 
helps to create smoother more realistic
animations<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:04.380> saved<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.649> lot<00:02:04.770> of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
animations and I just saved a lot of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.280 
animations and I just saved a lot of
time<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.630> animating<00:02:06.630> each<00:02:06.869> bone

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
time just animating each bone

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.219 
time just animating each bone
individually<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.220> done<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> don't<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.209> um

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
and so now we've got the arcade chain

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.800 
and so now we've got the arcade chain
sorta<00:02:45.290> took<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.620> three<00:02:46.800> characters<00:02:47.310> rigged

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
sorta took on three characters rigged

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.630 
sorta took on three characters rigged
they<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> lighting<00:02:49.489> on<00:02:50.489> each

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
around with news if I just render it in

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.500 
around with news if I just render it in
you'll<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:00.360> they're<00:03:01.110> nice<00:03:01.230> high<00:03:01.470> poly<00:03:01.709> models

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
you'll see they're nice high poly models

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.160 
you'll see they're nice high poly models
as<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.930> see<00:03:04.110> here<00:03:04.350> as<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:06.810> renders

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
as you can see here as it renders

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.350 
as you can see here as it renders
through<00:03:07.489> obviously<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.880> light<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.239> is

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
through obviously the light and is

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.630 
through obviously the light and is
taking<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.019> time<00:03:10.200> out<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.560> yeah<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:11.459> well

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
taking the time out but yeah but as well

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.820 
taking the time out but yeah but as well
as<00:03:11.910> um<00:03:12.319> everything<00:03:13.319> I've<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:13.620> mentioned

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
as um everything I've just mentioned

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.400 
as um everything I've just mentioned
each<00:03:14.670> character<00:03:15.180> has<00:03:15.209> different<00:03:15.330> textures<00:03:16.050> so

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
each character has different textures so

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.720 
each character has different textures so
I<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.739> there<00:03:16.860> may<00:03:16.950> be<00:03:16.980> different<00:03:17.459> clothes

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
I think there may be different clothes

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.350 
I think there may be different clothes
different<00:03:17.989> hairstyles<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:20.489> feel<00:03:21.120> free<00:03:21.150> to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
check those out in the texture folder

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.539 
check those out in the texture folder
sup<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:24.230> provided<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.260> each<00:03:25.530> character<00:03:25.829> so
