00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.310
 driving in caravan 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.230
 traveling in a caravan is something that 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.390
 it is possible to escape in the current traffic 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.690
 and will try to roll in the march more 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.369
 As long as possible, the 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.250
 be constantly accelerating to 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.020
 come back to stop next if you 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.630
 circulate fluidly without realizing 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.400
 continuous accelerations and braking are 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.610
 they will avoid unnecessary wear and tear 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.310
 car and fuel will be saved 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.590
 the deceleration process just like 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.510
 we have indicated previously returns here 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.340
 to play a role of importance to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.160
 represent a way to brake safely 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 with use of inertia and with 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 zero fuel consumption 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.810
 additions and exits of the tracks 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.940
 the incorporations 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.340
 for incorporation properly 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.440
 to roads and highways it is necessary that 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.150
 in the incorporation section it is reached 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.250
 roughly the speed that the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.490
 traffic you have or should have on the way to 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.829
 the one that is made the incorporation 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.689
 the incorporation can in some cases 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.149
 performed at a relatively fast speed 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.210
 high if this increases the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.250
 Safety in the operation to achieve 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.409
 good acceleration in the lane 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
 incorporation may be necessary 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.890
 change gears to a number 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.590
 relatively high revolutions 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.440
 within the interval assigned to the change 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.960
 of marches 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.540
 however when the driver circulates 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.730
 with anticipation anticipation and a 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.620
 convenient safety distance 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.200
 accelerations can be done in the 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.840
 most of the cases without exceeding 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.640
 2500 revolutions the outputs the output 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.410
 of the ways must be done is Nestor for 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.480
 vehicles are circulating 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.460
 behind which means that it should be 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.830
 leave the main road without 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.310
 slow down and not reduce it 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.619
 until you are already in the deviation section 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.590
 They will follow the same steps as the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.260
 approaching a curve doing so and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.150
 deceleration with greater security and 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.150
 taking advantage of the inertia of the vehicle
