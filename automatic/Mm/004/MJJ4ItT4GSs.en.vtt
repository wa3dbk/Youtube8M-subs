00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 andrés lópez lópez president of mayani who wrote four years ago 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.660
 his first book in a jail of the United States the poster of the toads 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.660
 successfully adapted for film and television has just finished his third 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.160
 book the informants of which he himself is producing a documentary and 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.400
 he has available a few visual rights 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.409
 of fiction I have been practically dedicated to this subject of the book for ten months 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.519
 I finish them twenty days or so or the story is delivered 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.749
 editorial enchanted with the content as such are very happy very 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:35.710
 satisfied 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.400
 and I think that in a month or so a long month or so we're going to have it already 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.580
 finally posted a very good honest story of super interesting 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.410
 it's a story of a real-life character who lived everything in all that 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.020
 drug trafficking world and I tell you from his point of view 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.280
 finally as it happens in others to quantity stories and all the facts 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.370
 percent I have it as a backbone or thread in an act in 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.559
 the documentary and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.630
 and there somehow yes the tip is this whole story the real one as 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.409
 they happened and documented as such and in their history or fiction a story 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.970
 very real the history of the informants 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.410
 how that world works for informants and why there are so many 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.490
 informants and where the informants come from and why they do it 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.040
 and why the Colombian of the checkpoints and lion 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.900
 look I'm doing a series for our Colombian channels a 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.880
 history this is a story where drug trafficking 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.300
 I walked away a little writing this roll about all that world of 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.420
 drug trafficking and imposes two other bullfighting quarters that people asked 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.770
 It's a narco-trafficking story and we roughly tell you how mature and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.090
 This world of drug trafficking evolved from in our country as finally 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.439
 took mexico to convert this into what became 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 and how it finally transcended to such an extent that it reached this cup in 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.750
 U.S 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 and you can see around here it's no secret that there was that still is like half or 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.690
 means secret but but it is one of these important channels in Colombia 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.500
 the match request can not be informed of what it is and if 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 have 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.920
 is that it is ready if there is a debate that a series the seals a series this 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.809
 series is completely written 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.819
 the west with fox television studios of los angeles 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.149
 the with emiliano cali and cabezudos 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.109
 and the person with whom we really have more integration this plan 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.459
 creative was Diego Suarez I think they are not super annotated with 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.389
 with the subject of their negotiation and not 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.949
 today I'm not surprised if maybe in a couple of months we can finally see it 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:32.749
 discover 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.719
 this is a story that has nothing to do with the world of drug trafficking 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.290
 this is a history of black humor is a very good story and a story 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.019
 that makes you feel you can 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.639
 see passively of dying of the emiratí press this point to the amount of 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.540
 situations 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.260
 to give the two main characters fourth episode of cristian 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.730
 drenthe we wrote three episodes but but we are in that process of 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.029
 e those for in turagua more than in three others 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.229
 and that transformed 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.299
 how to commit adopted industry as you have integrated her look 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.329
 I tell you an infinite fortune I think lobster as such affected me very 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.579
 well I think 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.139
 that I have had the fortune that people have entrusted a little in temple that 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.140
 André can agree to tell us in all these stories that the company had the 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.039
 opportunity to tell people 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:23.709
 I think that it has not been easy opposite what people think by the way 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.679
 chart said that in many times the door closed the doors in the 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:27.419
 face 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.089
 but I just keep going and I'm trying to do things right I 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.639
 simply what I intend is to try to earn my living in a decent way 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.649
 but but he did not hesitate for a second that maybe if I have the opportunity to 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.209
 talk to several people or maybe some have trusted me 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.029
 but undoubtedly there are others that somehow end the opposite 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.329
 other doors will be made 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.160
 but today I'm still just committed to what I'm doing 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.269
 And I think that 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.380
 that somehow then all that content and tone 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.849
 those things that are being generated 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.650
 from andrés lópez 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.090
 because in the end yes they have served for something I think it is people liked it 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.319
 All this 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.660
 I think people have also thought a lot about taking all this out 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.750
 I think that finally they are stories that generated many other 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.570
 people dared to tell them to write them and today we see that from 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.910
 somehow this has already become practically a theme is almost 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.460
 daily of many channels that choose to also want to have 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.729
 this kind of stories three I think that 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.839
 As long as all this is going on, we're going to keep seeing all that and I'll 

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.800
 I thank all those who will soon have André López and those who will 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.490
 not the same also I thank you infinitely
