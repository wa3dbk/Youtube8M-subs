00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.240
 the recovery of the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.620
 derailed train to andora in January with 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.280
 the skills came into play for 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.890
 this operation considers 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.349
 the place where the accident occurred e 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.170
 then a railway track 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.020
 unique in a coastal area rather 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.960
 impervious and therefore with the only one 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.240
 real possibility of access by sea 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.030
 engineering skills that are 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.450
 have been requested have been have been 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.010
 characterized by an enlarged spectrum 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.530
 certainly mechanical engineering for 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.140
 what regards the handling and the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 verification of the integrity of the media of 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.219
 locomotive in particular but also 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.829
 civil engineering with regards to 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.660
 the evaluation of the integrity of the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.260
 railway ballast the vessels 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.249
 used for lifting and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.980
 repositioning of the locomotive on the 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.499
 railway station and what were the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.710
 major difficulties encountered 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:08.050
 major difficulties consisted 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.630
 in identifying the window 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.479
 temporal within which to be able 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.750
 to move the naval vessels that they were 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.090
 the only or only chance for real 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.100
 to reach the goal is therefore in 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.259
 calli in calm conditions from the point 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.259
 view of sea weather to be able to 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.479
 move safely and also with 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.000
 then the locomotive precision 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.439
 reposition it correctly on the seat 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.390
 train 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.719
 to this must be added the fact that the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.270
 locomotive in the derailment phase 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.610
 it was rather rigidly bound 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.100
 with the first towed carriage and then 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.640
 a further element of difficulty was 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.650
 probably the separation of the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.800
 of the convoy in its two units 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.290
 locomotive and first carriage which thing 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.270
 normally it is done on the squares of the 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.220
 railway stations but in one 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.110
 altered geometry condition god 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.280
 credible for the precarious was certainly 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.280
 much more difficult
