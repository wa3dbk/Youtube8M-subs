00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 40 Elban pilots on almost 100 starters 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.280
 a record of holdings and per 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.170
 the 2012 edition of the Elba rally 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.559
 which returns with a value formula 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.929
 absolute 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.639
 six special stages and start and finish in 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.410
 light blue port leading back to 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.420
 event most awaited by sportsmen 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 of the island to the levels that belong to it 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 well surely a real return 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 national for the face of the bo is a lot 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.189
 important because it could be a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 first springboard for 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 return to a maximum series as 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 even the highest series now not 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 they had to do cars more than most 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.059
 special kilometers than here at Elba 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.370
 it will be very easy to find them and therefore a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.710
 good rally organized well and a volume 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.899
 participants in all the assumptions 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.930
 then slowly saline up to the level 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.940
 national starting with the number one a 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 pilot among the best in the ranking 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 national andrea perego drivers very much 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 young but those very clear ideas about 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.719
 charm of the streets of Elba are there 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.550
 was the third race in 2000 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 fourth race of my life I have beautiful 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.229
 remember I don't remember so much that the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.869
 it almost cholera at night and then there was 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.390
 he was also in 86 to see him for seven 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.760
 years with my father and so I always have 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 had fond memories of this island 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 as well as making holidays for the rally 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.040
 it is a very prestigious rally so it has 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.450
 since there was precisely 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.729
 the opportunity to come and run it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.850
 caught on the fly because it is still a 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.900
 rally from 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.940
 an incredible roll of honor with pilots 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.100
 very strong internationals so me 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.320
 I hope to finish the roll of honor too 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.420
 we hope well 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 beside perego on the car number 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.650
 an elban one even if adopted 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 alessandro floris expert 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.970
 navigator a real point of 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.280
 reference for all fans 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.010
 island floris perego needless to say 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.800
 depart with the favors of the prediction but 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.160
 I think so b that together we andrea 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.370
 took a test and two weeks ago there 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.280
 we found it good since the car 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.220
 di giovanni was not ready for this 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.350
 race here and then andrea we chose 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.300
 to come and have a race here in 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.760
 provision also for other tenders 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.880
 surely it will please everyone 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.310
 the other delegations see that the grass is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.520
 highly regarded is much appreciated by 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.520
