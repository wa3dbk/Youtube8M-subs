numbers<00:00:12.549> now<00:00:13.299> let's<00:00:13.809> start<00:00:14.110> with<00:00:14.289> addition

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:15.119 
numbers now let's start with addition

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.300 
numbers now let's start with addition
let's<00:00:16.119> say<00:00:16.330> we<00:00:16.600> are<00:00:16.630> given<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.289> number<00:00:17.740> one<00:00:18.160> by

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
let's say we are given a number one by

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.370 
let's say we are given a number one by
two<00:00:18.369> which<00:00:18.760> is<00:00:18.789> a<00:00:18.910> rational<00:00:19.150> number<00:00:19.570> and<00:00:19.780> we

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
two which is a rational number and we

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.830 
two which is a rational number and we
have<00:00:20.590> to<00:00:20.770> add<00:00:20.980> it<00:00:21.340> to<00:00:21.550> another<00:00:21.970> rational

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
have to add it to another rational

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.290 
have to add it to another rational
number<00:00:23.080> two<00:00:23.259> by<00:00:23.410> three<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:24.699> is<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:24.880> rational

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
number two by three this is a rational

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.759 
number two by three this is a rational
number<00:00:25.330> this<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:25.839> also<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.109> rational<00:00:26.320> number

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
number this is also a rational number

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.730 
number this is also a rational number
but<00:00:27.310> here<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.640> denominators<00:00:28.330> are<00:00:28.480> different

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
but here the denominators are different

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.320 
but here the denominators are different
when<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.890> denominators<00:00:30.580> are<00:00:30.699> different<00:00:31.119> we

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
when the denominators are different we

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.540 
when the denominators are different we
simply<00:00:31.869> cannot<00:00:32.230> add<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.680> numerator<00:00:33.130> and<00:00:33.370> get

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
simply cannot add the numerator and get

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.030 
simply cannot add the numerator and get
the<00:00:33.670> answer<00:00:34.030> we<00:00:34.240> will<00:00:34.570> have<00:00:34.720> to<00:00:34.840> take<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.500> LCM

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
the answer we will have to take the LCM

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.150 
the answer we will have to take the LCM
of<00:00:36.160> two<00:00:36.340> and<00:00:36.520> three<00:00:36.700> so<00:00:37.480> here<00:00:37.990> I<00:00:38.290> am<00:00:38.320> going<00:00:39.010> to

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
of two and three so here I am going to

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.040 
of two and three so here I am going to
show<00:00:39.370> you<00:00:39.430> how<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.790> take<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.240> LCM<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.690> two<00:00:40.870> and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
show you how to take the LCM of two and

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.190 
show you how to take the LCM of two and
three<00:00:41.170> so<00:00:41.890> we<00:00:42.220> are<00:00:42.340> going<00:00:42.490> to<00:00:42.780> find<00:00:43.780> these

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
three so we are going to find these

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.860 
three so we are going to find these
factors<00:00:44.770> we<00:00:45.160> take<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.790> lowest<00:00:46.150> prime<00:00:46.570> number

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
factors we take the lowest prime number

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.830 
factors we take the lowest prime number
that's<00:00:47.080> two<00:00:47.350> two<00:00:48.130> was<00:00:48.370> once<00:00:48.700> and<00:00:49.030> three

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
that's two two was once and three

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.500 
that's two two was once and three
remains<00:00:50.170> as<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.500> is<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:51.100> again<00:00:51.490> three<00:00:51.790> this

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
remains as it is then again three this

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.060 
remains as it is then again three this
is<00:00:52.570> one<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.140> one<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.620> process<00:00:53.950> is

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
is one and one so the process is

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.120 
is one and one so the process is
repeated<00:00:54.310> till<00:00:54.790> we<00:00:54.970> get<00:00:55.150> one<00:00:55.360> yet<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:55.840> we<00:00:56.830> find

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
repeated till we get one yet so we find

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.130 
repeated till we get one yet so we find
the<00:00:57.580> factors<00:00:58.090> are<00:00:58.270> two<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.630> three<00:00:58.810> we

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
the factors are two and three we

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.800 
the factors are two and three we
multiply<00:00:59.620> two<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.980> three<00:01:00.160> we<00:01:00.400> get<00:01:00.580> 6<00:01:00.970> so<00:01:01.300> LCM

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
multiply two and three we get 6 so LCM

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.850 
multiply two and three we get 6 so LCM
is<00:01:02.020> 6<00:01:02.640> now<00:01:03.640> we<00:01:03.940> see<00:01:04.570> how<00:01:04.839> many<00:01:05.019> times<00:01:05.290> 2<00:01:05.500> goes<00:01:05.710> in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
is 6 now we see how many times 2 goes in

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.760 
is 6 now we see how many times 2 goes in
6<00:01:06.070> 2<00:01:06.549> goes<00:01:06.759> three<00:01:07.090> times<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:08.350> number<00:01:08.740> has

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
6 2 goes three times and that number has

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.430 
6 2 goes three times and that number has
to<00:01:09.070> be<00:01:09.100> multiplied<00:01:09.640> by<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.880> numerator<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:10.900> 3

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
to be multiplied by the numerator so 3

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.150 
to be multiplied by the numerator so 3
into<00:01:11.620> 1<00:01:11.830> we<00:01:12.130> are<00:01:12.160> going<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.430> get<00:01:12.550> 3<00:01:12.820> plus<00:01:14.160> the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
into 1 we are going to get 3 plus the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.920 
into 1 we are going to get 3 plus the
number<00:01:15.490> here<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:15.820> 3<00:01:16.090> we<00:01:16.480> will<00:01:16.600> see<00:01:16.720> how<00:01:16.870> many

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
number here is 3 we will see how many

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.350 
number here is 3 we will see how many
times<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:17.470> going<00:01:17.620> in<00:01:17.830> 6<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:18.670> 3<00:01:18.850> goes<00:01:18.940> 2<00:01:19.330> times

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
times it is going in 6 so 3 goes 2 times

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.020 
times it is going in 6 so 3 goes 2 times
so<00:01:20.170> 2<00:01:20.230> multiplied<00:01:20.890> by<00:01:20.920> 2<00:01:21.130> we<00:01:21.640> are<00:01:21.700> going<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.940> get

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
so 2 multiplied by 2 we are going to get

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.200 
so 2 multiplied by 2 we are going to get
4<00:01:22.360> so<00:01:23.110> 3<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.620> 4<00:01:23.800> can<00:01:24.040> now<00:01:24.250> be<00:01:24.490> added<00:01:24.640> we<00:01:25.120> are

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
4 so 3 and 4 can now be added we are

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.050 
4 so 3 and 4 can now be added we are
going<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.450> get<00:01:25.570> 7<00:01:26.200> upon<00:01:26.500> 6<00:01:26.980> so<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:27.730> is<00:01:27.790> the

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
going to get 7 upon 6 so this is the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.110 
going to get 7 upon 6 so this is the
method<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.630> addition<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.409> rational<00:01:29.800> numbers

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
method of addition of rational numbers

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.770 
method of addition of rational numbers
the<00:01:31.120> same<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:31.690> can<00:01:31.720> try<00:01:32.140> out<00:01:32.290> for<00:01:32.530> subtraction

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the same we can try out for subtraction

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.630 
the same we can try out for subtraction
let's<00:01:34.780> say<00:01:34.960> we<00:01:35.200> are<00:01:35.229> having<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.680> number<00:01:35.979> 3<00:01:36.220> by<00:01:36.370> 4

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
let's say we are having a number 3 by 4

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.100 
let's say we are having a number 3 by 4
and<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:37.510> are<00:01:37.630> subtracting<00:01:38.229> let's<00:01:38.680> say<00:01:38.860> 1<00:01:39.310> by<00:01:39.490> 5

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and we are subtracting let's say 1 by 5

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.810 
and we are subtracting let's say 1 by 5
again<00:01:41.110> we<00:01:41.290> find<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.010> denominators<00:01:42.670> are

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
again we find that the denominators are

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.000 
again we find that the denominators are
different<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.930> are<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.440> find<00:01:44.680> out<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
different we are going to find out the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.090 
different we are going to find out the
LCM<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:46.060> denominators<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.830> LCM

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.100 
twos are four five remains as it is then
two<00:01:56.950> one<00:01:57.190> zero<00:01:57.220> five<00:01:58.060> remains<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:58.780> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
two one zero five remains as it is and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.920 
two one zero five remains as it is and
then<00:01:59.380> finally<00:01:59.830> five<00:02:00.460> goes<00:02:00.760> wonder<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.690> the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
then finally five goes wonder so the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.530 
then finally five goes wonder so the
process<00:02:02.290> is<00:02:02.580> finished<00:02:03.580> here<00:02:03.760> because<00:02:04.119> we<00:02:04.420> are

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
process is finished here because we are

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.780 
process is finished here because we are
left<00:02:04.720> with<00:02:04.930> one<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.320> one<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.710> find<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
left with one and one you find the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.139 
left with one and one you find the
factors<00:02:07.150> are<00:02:07.360> 202<00:02:08.049> into<00:02:08.289> 5<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.459> 2<00:02:09.670> into<00:02:09.819> 2<00:02:10.030> into

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
factors are 202 into 5 so 2 into 2 into

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.470 
factors are 202 into 5 so 2 into 2 into
5<00:02:10.450> becomes<00:02:10.869> 4<00:02:11.200> into<00:02:11.440> 5<00:02:11.620> thats<00:02:11.980> 20<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.180> we<00:02:13.209> are

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
5 becomes 4 into 5 thats 20 so we are

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.410 
5 becomes 4 into 5 thats 20 so we are
getting<00:02:13.779> the<00:02:13.900> LCM<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.409> 20<00:02:14.980> now<00:02:15.909> we<00:02:15.969> check<00:02:16.359> for

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
getting the LCM as 20 now we check for

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.230 
getting the LCM as 20 now we check for
goals<00:02:16.959> how<00:02:17.109> many<00:02:17.290> times<00:02:17.529> in<00:02:17.709> 20

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
goals how many times in 20

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.170 
goals how many times in 20
four<00:02:18.630> goes<00:02:18.840> five<00:02:19.110> times<00:02:19.440> five<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.520> multiplied

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
four goes five times five is multiplied

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.350 
four goes five times five is multiplied
by<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.420> numerator<00:02:22.020> here<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.770> 5<00:02:23.100> into<00:02:23.520> 3<00:02:23.550> we<00:02:24.270> are

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
by the numerator here so 5 into 3 we are

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.220 
by the numerator here so 5 into 3 we are
going<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.600> get<00:02:24.720> 15<00:02:25.520> minus<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:27.180> take<00:02:27.420> 5<00:02:27.870> goes<00:02:28.110> how

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
going to get 15 minus we take 5 goes how

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.010 
going to get 15 minus we take 5 goes how
many<00:02:28.410> times<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.770> 20<00:02:29.070> here<00:02:29.220> 5<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.610> 4<00:02:29.880> times<00:02:30.150> 4<00:02:30.990> is

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
many times in 20 here 5 was 4 times 4 is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.870 
many times in 20 here 5 was 4 times 4 is
multiplied<00:02:31.650> by<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.890> numerator<00:02:32.340> here<00:02:32.670> that's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
multiplied by the numerator here that's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.790 
multiplied by the numerator here that's
1<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.840> we<00:02:34.410> get<00:02:34.620> 4<00:02:34.890> here<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.370> 15<00:02:36.360> minus<00:02:37.080> 4<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:37.710> are

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
1 so we get 4 here so 15 minus 4 we are

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.230 
1 so we get 4 here so 15 minus 4 we are
going<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.070> get<00:02:38.220> 11<00:02:39.090> upon<00:02:39.540> 20<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.800> these<00:02:41.520> are<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
going to get 11 upon 20 so these are the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.840 
going to get 11 upon 20 so these are the
methods<00:02:42.540> by<00:02:43.110> which<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.830> add<00:02:44.130> or<00:02:44.430> subtract

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
methods by which we can add or subtract

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.810 
methods by which we can add or subtract
rational<00:02:44.880> numbers<00:02:45.570> by<00:02:45.720> taking<00:02:46.590> LCM<00:02:46.820> however

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
rational numbers by taking LCM however

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.000 
rational numbers by taking LCM however
if<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.510> denominators<00:02:49.140> are<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.380> same<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.980> can

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
if the denominators are the same you can

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.630 
if the denominators are the same you can
simply<00:02:50.610> add<00:02:50.880> or<00:02:51.090> subtract
