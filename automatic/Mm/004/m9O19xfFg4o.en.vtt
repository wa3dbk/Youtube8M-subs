 Hi there, this is a channel how to do it and 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.770
 today we will make a mug or cup 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.359
 from a plastic bottle 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.220
 such a mug you may need where 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:24.890
 anywhere in the garage or in the kitchen 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:32.270
 so what do we need plastic 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:35.500
 bottle knife marker scissors to start 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.420
 we need to mark our future mug 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:53.149
 for this we take a marker and put 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:55.579
 following markup after we 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.030
 put markup we need to take a knife and 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.139
 neatly cut everything to get 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.629
 straight cuts 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:04.629
 no chipping better use scissors 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 So 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.430
 but 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.640
 our stocking is ready now we need 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.320
 unscrew the top and thread it 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.320

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.649
 well yes 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.340
