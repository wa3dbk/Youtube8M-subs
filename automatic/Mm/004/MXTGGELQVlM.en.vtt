00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.700
 on the principle of having breakfast 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.460
 found with a booster of the series x 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.570
 and rec 2 is a salt that I opened Ia 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.700
 the day before yesterday I believe that two days ago 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.950
 indeed we saw precisely the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.090
 pokemon with the effigy of booster 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.770
 I thought I'll go 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.180
 put this one there maybe he will us 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.180
 attract another good card 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.460
 this is nemey llose the famous 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.350
 lion king the booster is very very beautiful 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.850
 I let you see for yourself with 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.750
 the flames that surround it it's worth 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.759
 really worth the detour 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.860
 the back of a booster if you wish 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.689
 read the description and as for me I 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.820
 go to his discovery I hope we go 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.200
 to be hasty again in any case is 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.880
 a salt is a nice series I do not 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.399
 will stop saying it and I hope we will 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.320
 to be spoiled the online code is for you 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.340
 I did the technique of 1 2 3 1 2 for 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.530
 put the best cards 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.420
 in the end I will quickly show you 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.159
 breakfast background this is a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420
 small family meadow where all the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.030
 world comes to taste in any case I 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.280
 find very nice and very nice very 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.319
 nice and very friendly and for me 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.090
 I'm going to open up finally rather to the 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.670
 discovery of the cards of these boosters 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.259
 so we start with a pokemon made 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.499
 I do not like the fact pokemon 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.990
 and it will be a flat db behind us 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:49.280
 will have a movement is followed by roselia 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.929
 operates mind that's how the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.039
 pronounced my dear explains amy so at 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.509
 early I said to the permit but 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.159
 now as soon as she learned it in 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.069
 oppermann as I always say there 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.240
 behind small apple that the pokemon that 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.469
 explodes all the time but that is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.039
 always very friendly 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.999
 a re serves the register of friends fogler a 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.740
 unusual 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.819
 she's not bad at all she's pretty 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.560
 simple but I find that spring 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.500
 perfectly with the map and even the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.910
 illustration background very beautiful pokemon 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.220
 behind another one will be our 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.040
 trainer not easy to say it will be the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.590
 head of the team flare the famous reading 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.780
 then afterwards a very good pick 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 rare winter is a reversal 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.530
 it is about martin art it is announced 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.659
 very promising in any case it's a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.760
 very good booster let's see the last one 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.709
 card it's gone to a second few 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.510
 we had two rats in a booster 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.459
 personally I'm not very fan of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.560
 pope illusion is a studio stration 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.629
 nice but I prefer much more 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.340
 fruits there look at me that look at me 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.989
 this little pokemon malice that in all 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.389
 case I love it I find very very 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.730
 Well design is very original game 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.200
 adore the lookout for the female 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.269
 wraps around the little ones for 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.629
 cradle he cornered enemies thanks to his 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.220
 speed 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.900
 yes as they have me very fast 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.099
 among other things in any case here I am 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.329
 content we wanted rather a 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.129
 nice opening 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.689
 I do not put the two best quarters of 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.519
 this opening here and there 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.489
 the booster name helios wandering around 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.019
 by that he will come back here and here we have 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.760

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.090
 nice we had two rare so we got 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.040
 avoided the disaster we could have 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.329
 a rare between nerd breeders this airlock and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.489
 the boosters I like least 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.750
 at least we are spoiled for choice 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.700
 prefer pope illusion who prefers 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.109

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.190

 what am I going to do I have my little idea 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.970
 in any case maybe it will not be 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.300
 an opening booster we'll see 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.200
