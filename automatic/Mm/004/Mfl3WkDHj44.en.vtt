I'm very happy with this thing right

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.770 
I'm very happy with this thing right
here<00:01:58.490> 12<00:01:59.490> volt<00:01:59.729> AC<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:01.110> thing<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.500> awesome<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
here 12 volt AC this thing is awesome a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
here 12 volt AC this thing is awesome a
little<00:02:03.780> cumbersome<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> invested<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.909> one

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
little cumbersome so I invested in one

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.650 
little cumbersome so I invested in one
of<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:07.069> so<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.429> will<00:02:08.580> run<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.000> ice<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
of these so this one will run on ice and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.370 
of these so this one will run on ice and
it'll<00:02:10.200> also<00:02:10.590> run<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:11.009> water

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
it'll also run on water

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.160 
it'll also run on water
but<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:14.100> know<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.340> cumbersome<00:02:14.910> because<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
but you know it's cumbersome because it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.320 
but you know it's cumbersome because it
doesn't<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.560> an<00:02:16.680> internal<00:02:16.980> internal<00:02:17.820> water
