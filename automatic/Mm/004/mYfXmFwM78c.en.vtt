and<00:00:43.010> now<00:00:44.010> let's<00:00:44.460> learn<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.850> step<00:00:45.059> together

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and now let's learn this step together

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.139 
and now let's learn this step together
because<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.590> very<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.039> similar<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> we

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
because it's very very similar and we

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.990 
because it's very very similar and we
can<00:00:48.329> practice<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.950> way<00:00:50.160> successfully<00:00:50.850> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
can practice it that way successfully so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.229 
can practice it that way successfully so
you're<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.600> let's<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.239> back

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
technical points on this step when we

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.340 
technical points on this step when we
dance<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.770> either<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.130> manner<00:02:51.430> as<00:02:51.700> lady<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
say we're doing a a forward locking step

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.950 
say we're doing a a forward locking step
after<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.990> back<00:02:56.140> basic<00:02:56.620> two<00:02:56.980> three<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:58.540> take

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
after the back basic two three we take

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.870 
after the back basic two three we take
the<00:02:59.170> knee<00:02:59.320> through<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.070> hip<00:03:00.280> goes<00:03:00.550> with

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
the knee through and the hip goes with

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.550 
the knee through and the hip goes with
it<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.270> we're<00:03:01.420> leading<00:03:01.660> with<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.020> right<00:03:02.050> side

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
it so we're leading with the right side

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.150 
it so we're leading with the right side
now<00:03:03.460> mostly<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.780> right<00:03:04.960> hip<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.320> forward<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
now mostly the right hip is forward the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.580 
now mostly the right hip is forward the
left<00:03:06.370> tip<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:06.760> back<00:03:07.000> our<00:03:07.480> top<00:03:07.900> has<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.200> slight

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
left tip is back our top has a slight

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.320 
left tip is back our top has a slight
angle<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.580> not<00:03:09.730> turn<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.060> the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
angle to it but it's not turn to the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.350 
angle to it but it's not turn to the
extent<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:10.810> our<00:03:10.960> hips<00:03:11.170> are<00:03:11.350> cross<00:03:12.070> behind<00:03:12.370> step

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
extent as our hips are cross behind step

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.600 
extent as our hips are cross behind step
forward<00:03:13.840> now<00:03:14.320> we've<00:03:14.560> got<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.770> change<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.400> hip

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
forward now we've got to change this hip

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.180 
forward now we've got to change this hip
position<00:03:16.260> rotate<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.890> left<00:03:18.100> side

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
position rotate it so that the left side

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.570 
position rotate it so that the left side
leads<00:03:18.930> cross<00:03:19.930> behind<00:03:20.350> now<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.920> right<00:03:21.280> side

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
leads cross behind now the right side

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.350 
leads cross behind now the right side
must<00:03:21.820> turn<00:03:22.090> through<00:03:22.860> like<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.180> have<00:03:25.330> a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
must turn through like so so you have a

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.030 
must turn through like so so you have a
little<00:03:25.630> rotation<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:26.290> takes<00:03:26.500> place<00:03:26.770> there

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
little rotation that takes place there

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.280 
little rotation that takes place there
and<00:03:27.400> let's<00:03:28.330> do<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.510> one<00:03:28.660> more<00:03:28.810> time<00:03:28.960> from<00:03:29.140> a

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
and let's do it one more time from a

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.480 
and let's do it one more time from a
back<00:03:29.440> basic<00:03:29.890> two<00:03:31.140> three<00:03:32.140> right<00:03:32.800> side<00:03:33.130> leading

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
back basic two three right side leading

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.270 
back basic two three right side leading
four<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.000> one<00:03:34.360> left<00:03:34.990> side<00:03:35.260> leading<00:03:35.620> two<00:03:35.980> and

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
four and one left side leading two and

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.180 
four and one left side leading two and
three<00:03:36.940> right<00:03:37.180> side<00:03:37.480> leading<00:03:37.690> four<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.680> one

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
three right side leading four and one

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.070 
three right side leading four and one
okay<00:03:39.730> let's<00:03:39.910> work<00:03:40.060> on<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.420> back<00:03:40.600> lock<00:03:40.900> now

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
remember the technique when we close our

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.290 
remember the technique when we close our
feet<00:04:22.410> remember<00:04:22.740> when<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:22.919> practice<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.400> we

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
feet remember when we practice that we

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.439 
feet remember when we practice that we
turn<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.840> hip<00:04:25.080> back<00:04:26.150> when<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.270> leg

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
turn the hip back when the leg

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.010 
turn the hip back when the leg
straightened<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.979> knee<00:04:29.160> came<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.690> need<00:04:30.870> is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
straightened the knee came the need is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.719 
straightened the knee came the need is
coming<00:04:31.380> forward<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:31.949> hip<00:04:32.160> follows<00:04:32.550> it

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
coming forward that hip follows it

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.270 
coming forward that hip follows it
that's<00:04:32.940> above<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.830> same<00:04:35.070> thing

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
that's above it so the same thing

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.689 
that's above it so the same thing
applies<00:04:35.610> here<00:04:36.830> take<00:04:37.830> your<00:04:38.009> partner<00:04:38.370> double

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
applies here take your partner double

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.090 
applies here take your partner double
handhold<00:04:38.970> we'll<00:04:39.300> try<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.830> two<00:04:41.000> three<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:43.100> she's

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
handhold we'll try it two three if she's

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.339 
handhold we'll try it two three if she's
locking<00:04:44.340> forward<00:04:44.940> her<00:04:45.150> right<00:04:45.449> side<00:04:45.479> leads<00:04:46.050> and

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
locking forward her right side leads and
