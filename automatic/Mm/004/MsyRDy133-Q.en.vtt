kind of cool and let's go ahead and use

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.680 
kind of cool and let's go ahead and use
our<00:02:07.420> key<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.830> can<00:02:08.860> open<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.280> door<00:02:09.489> so<00:02:10.030> this

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
our key and we can open the door so this

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.449 
our key and we can open the door so this
only<00:02:10.899> works<00:02:11.230> with<00:02:11.440> your<00:02:11.560> specific<00:02:11.769> keys<00:02:12.280> to

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
only works with your specific keys to

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
say another player had two keys I don't

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.660 
say another player had two keys I don't
