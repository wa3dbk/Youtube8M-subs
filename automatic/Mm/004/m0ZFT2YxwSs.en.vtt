holes that allows this tower to be

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
holes that allows this tower to be
connected<00:00:46.079> together<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.190> irrigation

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
connected together so the irrigation

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
connected together so the irrigation
brings<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> nutrient<00:00:49.079> solution<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.649> at

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the top into the top pot and then it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.799 
the top into the top pot and then it
goes<00:00:52.500> through<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> whole<00:00:53.850> stock<00:00:54.449> and

goes through the whole stock and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
goes through the whole stock and
eventually<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> bottom<00:00:56.460> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
eventually down at the bottom is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
eventually down at the bottom is

these vertical tower systems is the fact

these vertical tower systems is the fact
that<00:02:47.099> if<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.459> try<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:47.730> put<00:02:48.000> too<00:02:48.150> many<00:02:48.269> towers

that if you try to put too many towers

that if you try to put too many towers
