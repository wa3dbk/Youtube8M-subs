you're<00:02:33.720> you're<00:02:34.260> landing<00:02:34.470> what<00:02:34.890> your<00:02:35.239> farmland

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
you're you're landing what your farmland

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.390 
you're you're landing what your farmland
anymore<00:02:36.720> excuse<00:02:37.200> me<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:38.099> do<00:02:38.160> not

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
anymore excuse me and they do not

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.550 
anymore excuse me and they do not
trigger<00:02:38.760> pressure<00:02:39.150> plates<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.840> believe<00:02:40.290> it's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
trigger pressure plates I believe it's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.229 
trigger pressure plates I believe it's
both<00:02:40.799> pressure<00:02:41.069> plates<00:02:41.370> from<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:41.970> i<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.090> see

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
both pressure plates from what i can see

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.140 
both pressure plates from what i can see
that<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.170> case<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.489> also<00:02:44.819> they<00:02:45.000> would

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
that is the case and also they would

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.820 
that is the case and also they would
trigger<00:02:45.330> tripwire<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.049> they<00:02:46.170> do<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.440> anymore

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
trigger tripwire but they do not anymore

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.250 
trigger tripwire but they do not anymore
which<00:02:47.099> is<00:02:47.280> pretty<00:02:47.459> good<00:02:47.700> because<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.140> know

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
which is pretty good because you know

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.740 
which is pretty good because you know
bats<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.549> pretty<00:02:50.819> much<00:02:50.910> spawn<00:02:51.269> anywhere

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
bats can pretty much spawn anywhere

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.940 
bats can pretty much spawn anywhere
basically<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:54.049> yeah<00:02:55.049> thats<00:02:55.380> that'd<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.769> kind

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
basically and yeah thats that'd be kind

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.100 
basically and yeah thats that'd be kind
of<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.099> pain<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.480> batch<00:02:57.630> trigger<00:02:58.019> a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
of a pain to have the batch trigger a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.809 
of a pain to have the batch trigger a
tripwire<00:02:58.410> when<00:02:58.950> you've<00:02:59.069> got<00:02:59.220> some<00:02:59.489> kind<00:02:59.670> of

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
tripwire when you've got some kind of

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.870 
tripwire when you've got some kind of
trap<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.360> anything<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:01.579> also<00:03:02.579> each

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
trap or anything like that so also each

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.050 
trap or anything like that so also each
individual<00:03:03.810> server<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.769> now<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.730> hidden

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
individual server can now be hidden

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.360 
individual server can now be hidden
individually<00:03:06.840> which<00:03:07.620> i<00:03:07.920> don't<00:03:08.040> know<00:03:08.220> what

me<00:03:39.269> get<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.480> repairable<00:03:39.750> real<00:03:40.019> quick<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:41.010> we

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.120 
me get it repairable real quick there we
go<00:03:41.579> welcome<00:03:42.030> back<00:03:42.090> over<00:03:42.359> here<00:03:42.780> mess<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:43.950> that

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
go welcome back over here mess with that

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.610 
go welcome back over here mess with that
a<00:03:44.160> little<00:03:44.340> bit<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.819> there<00:03:45.630> we<00:03:45.720> go<00:03:45.750> it'll<00:03:46.530> be

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
a little bit and there we go it'll be

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.430 
a little bit and there we go it'll be
red<00:03:46.889> if<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.489> too<00:03:47.700> expensive<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.510> we'll<00:03:49.319> go

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
red if it's too expensive and we'll go

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.690 
red if it's too expensive and we'll go
in<00:03:49.530> creative<00:03:49.920> mode<00:03:49.950> because<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.609> an

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
in creative mode because you have an

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.940 
in creative mode because you have an
infinite<00:03:51.000> levels<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:52.700> game<00:03:53.700> mode<00:03:53.880> 1<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.950> it'll

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
infinite levels in game mode 1 and it'll

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.550 
infinite levels in game mode 1 and it'll
be<00:03:56.010> green<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.510> that's<00:03:57.780> really<00:03:58.019> nice<00:03:58.260> i<00:03:58.470> like

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
be green so that's really nice i like

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.170 
be green so that's really nice i like
that<00:03:58.769> is<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.579> fine<00:04:00.060> touch<00:04:00.329> indeed<00:04:01.489> now<00:04:02.489> for<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
that is a fine touch indeed now for the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.629 
that is a fine touch indeed now for the
main<00:04:03.299> attraction<00:04:03.920> right<00:04:04.920> here<00:04:05.190> as<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.489> guys

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
main attraction right here as you guys

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.670 
main attraction right here as you guys
can<00:04:05.819> see<00:04:05.880> we've<00:04:06.299> got<00:04:06.510> three<00:04:06.900> or<00:04:06.989> peters<00:04:07.290> these

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
can see we've got three or peters these

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.259 
can see we've got three or peters these
two<00:04:07.889> repeaters<00:04:08.160> are<00:04:08.340> facing<00:04:08.700> into<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.090> one

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
two repeaters are facing into this one

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.849 
two repeaters are facing into this one
right<00:04:09.359> here<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:10.200> you'll<00:04:10.530> see<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> little

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
right here and you'll see a little

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.190 
right here and you'll see a little
graphical<00:04:11.459> change<00:04:11.760> with<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.870> repeaters

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
graphical change with the repeaters

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.659 
graphical change with the repeaters
right<00:04:13.349> here<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.709> can<00:04:13.859> actually<00:04:14.010> input<00:04:14.579> them

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
right here you can actually input them

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.060 
right here you can actually input them
to<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:14.910> sides<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.450> once<00:04:16.169> we<00:04:16.289> do<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.919> can

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
to the sides and once we do that you can

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.310 
to the sides and once we do that you can
see<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.310> little<00:04:17.430> bedrock<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.539> is<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> locked

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
see the little bedrock that is a locked

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.670 
see the little bedrock that is a locked
repeater<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.250> cannot<00:04:20.729> be<00:04:20.789> triggered<00:04:21.409> it<00:04:22.409> will

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
repeater it cannot be triggered it will

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.350 
repeater it cannot be triggered it will
remember<00:04:22.979> it's<00:04:23.340> kind<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.580> like<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:23.760> memory<00:04:24.090> cell

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
remember it's kind of like a memory cell

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.520 
remember it's kind of like a memory cell
it'll<00:04:24.630> remember

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
it'll remember

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.520 
it'll remember
ever<00:04:26.360> its<00:04:27.360> original<00:04:27.570> state<00:04:27.900> was<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.410> we

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
ever its original state was and we

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.980 
ever its original state was and we
cannot<00:04:28.800> toggle<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.340> by<00:04:29.460> any<00:04:29.639> means<00:04:29.750> if<00:04:30.750> we<00:04:30.870> do

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
cannot toggle it by any means if we do

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.070 
cannot toggle it by any means if we do
the<00:04:31.110> same<00:04:31.230> thing<00:04:31.410> over<00:04:31.500> here<00:04:31.910> no<00:04:32.910> good<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:34.020> I

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
the same thing over here no good so I

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.780 
the same thing over here no good so I
think<00:04:34.169> it's<00:04:34.440> like<00:04:34.590> an<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.919> gate<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.190> believe<00:04:35.520> in

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
think it's like an and gate I believe in

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.520 
think it's like an and gate I believe in
a<00:04:35.970> nd<00:04:36.270> i'm<00:04:36.540> not<00:04:36.720> sure<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:36.930> i<00:04:37.169> don't<00:04:37.500> think

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
a nd i'm not sure that i don't think

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.680 
a nd i'm not sure that i don't think
that's<00:04:37.710> right<00:04:37.980> actually<00:04:38.360> but<00:04:39.360> once<00:04:39.540> they're

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
that's right actually but once they're

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.830 
that's right actually but once they're
both<00:04:39.840> off<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.550> input<00:04:41.550> could<00:04:41.639> be<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.880> but<00:04:42.750> it

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
both off the input could be on but it

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.230 
both off the input could be on but it
also<00:04:42.990> works<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.440> opposite<00:04:43.889> way<00:04:44.100> as<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.090> guys

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
also works the opposite way as you guys

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.560 
also works the opposite way as you guys
can<00:04:45.389> see<00:04:45.450> if<00:04:46.200> we<00:04:46.290> turn<00:04:46.470> just<00:04:46.770> one<00:04:46.919> of<00:04:47.010> them<00:04:47.160> on

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
can see if we turn just one of them on

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
can see if we turn just one of them on
there<00:04:48.570> might<00:04:48.690> be<00:04:48.720> an<00:04:48.870> or<00:04:49.020> gate<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.350> don't<00:04:49.530> know

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
there might be an or gate I don't know

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.840 
there might be an or gate I don't know
what<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.919> but<00:04:49.950> you<00:04:50.130> guys<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.460> tell<00:04:50.580> me<00:04:50.669> in

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
what it is but you guys can tell me in

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.450 
what it is but you guys can tell me in
the<00:04:51.570> comments<00:04:51.840> below<00:04:51.930> not<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.889> very<00:04:53.100> Pro<00:04:53.340> with

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
the comments below not a very Pro with

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.760 
the comments below not a very Pro with
that<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:53.850> yet<00:04:53.970> remembers<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.870> state<00:04:55.350> that<00:04:55.650> it

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
that but yet remembers the state that it

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.220 
that but yet remembers the state that it
was<00:04:55.860> at<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:57.030> this<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.330> basically<00:04:57.510> just<00:04:57.810> it

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
was at and this is basically just it

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.400 
was at and this is basically just it
locks<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:59.450> repeater<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.960> current<00:05:01.200> state

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
locks the repeater and the current state

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.750 
locks the repeater and the current state
so<00:05:01.590> that's<00:05:01.770> gonna<00:05:01.890> be<00:05:01.980> really<00:05:02.130> useful<00:05:02.340> summer

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
so that's gonna be really useful summer

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.130 
so that's gonna be really useful summer
for<00:05:03.000> somebody<00:05:03.240> you<00:05:03.300> read<00:05:03.450> stoners<00:05:03.810> out<00:05:03.960> there

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
for somebody you read stoners out there

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.710 
for somebody you read stoners out there
and<00:05:04.410> yeah<00:05:05.400> try<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:05.850> find<00:05:06.060> some<00:05:06.210> uses<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:06.630> let

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
and yeah try to find some uses and let

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.820
