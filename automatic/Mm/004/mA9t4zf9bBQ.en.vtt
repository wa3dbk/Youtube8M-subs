00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
because I don't really enjoy the game
and<00:01:49.110> I'm<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> time<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.149> play

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and I'm not gonna have the time to play

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
and I'm not gonna have the time to play
it<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> figured<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.470> might<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.680> well<00:01:52.799> sell<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it so I figured I might as well sell it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
it so I figured I might as well sell it
now<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> money<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:55.259> some<00:01:55.560> of

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
now and get the money that are some of

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.560 
now and get the money that are some of
the<00:01:55.710> money<00:01:55.890> back<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.670> paid<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> game

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the money back that I paid for the game

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.959 
the money back that I paid for the game
