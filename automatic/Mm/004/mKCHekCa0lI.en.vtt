00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
opinion in the comments below personally

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.340 
opinion in the comments below personally
I<00:03:47.000> think<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.790> jacks<00:03:50.150> figure<00:03:50.660> does<00:03:50.989> have

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
I think that the jacks figure does have

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.920 
I think that the jacks figure does have
a<00:03:51.380> better<00:03:51.830> likeness<00:03:52.550> in<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:53.150> face<00:03:53.480> for

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
a better likeness in the face for

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.190 
a better likeness in the face for
Natalya<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:54.670> what<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.700> like<00:03:56.000> better<00:03:56.540> about<00:03:56.959> the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
Natalya but what I like better about the

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.090 
Natalya but what I like better about the
Mattel<00:03:57.650> figure<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.870> figure<00:04:00.350> better

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
Mattel figure is that the figure better

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.500 
Mattel figure is that the figure better
captures<00:04:02.050> Natalia's<00:04:03.050> stocky<00:04:03.560> body<00:04:04.040> type

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
captures Natalia's stocky body type

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.750 
captures Natalia's stocky body type
because<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.810> female<00:04:06.320> body<00:04:06.560> type<00:04:06.980> Jax<00:04:07.400> used

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
because the female body type Jax used

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.110 
because the female body type Jax used
for<00:04:08.060> all<00:04:08.300> its<00:04:08.600> Divas<00:04:09.260> figures<00:04:09.830> aired<00:04:10.340> on<00:04:10.940> the

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
for all its Divas figures aired on the

of stockier bulkier divas like Natalia
and<00:04:17.209> Beth<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:18.019> think<00:04:18.650> this<00:04:18.859> skinny<00:04:19.310> body<00:04:19.669> type

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
and Beth I think this skinny body type

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.510 
and Beth I think this skinny body type
never<00:04:20.450> suited<00:04:21.020> them<00:04:21.289> beyond<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.100> likeness
