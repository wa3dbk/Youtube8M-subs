that dudes just killed four of us with

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.589 
that dudes just killed four of us with
that<00:02:17.219> javelin<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.939> at<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.150> point<00:02:18.359> I<00:02:18.450> was

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
that javelin and at that point I was

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.250 
that javelin and at that point I was
like<00:02:18.659> I<00:02:18.900> must<00:02:19.260> learn<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.049> was<00:02:22.230> just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
like I must learn you like I was just

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.599 
like I must learn you like I was just
like<00:02:22.439> I<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.890> learn<00:02:23.010> how<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:23.430> thing

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
like I have to learn how this thing

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.830 
like I have to learn how this thing
works<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.390> at<00:02:24.719> that<00:02:24.840> point<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.349> decided<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:26.840> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
works so at that point I decided to to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.319 
works so at that point I decided to to
just<00:02:27.870> go<00:02:28.319> for<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.829> try<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> figure<00:02:30.060> out<00:02:30.239> how

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
just go for it and try to figure out how

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.399 
just go for it and try to figure out how
to<00:02:30.389> use<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:30.689> because<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.900> didn't<00:02:31.109> understand

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
to use it because I didn't understand

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.629 
to use it because I didn't understand
how<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.560> locked<00:02:31.799> on<00:02:31.980> or<00:02:32.040> anything<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.489> that

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
how it locked on or anything like that

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.809 
how it locked on or anything like that
once<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.540> figured<00:02:33.780> out<00:02:33.840> how<00:02:33.959> locked<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
once I figured out how locked on and

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.699 
once I figured out how locked on and
everything<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.569> just<00:02:36.719> awesome<00:02:36.989> dude<00:02:37.500> and

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
everything it was just awesome dude and

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.979 
everything it was just awesome dude and
after<00:02:38.250> my<00:02:38.400> first<00:02:38.639> like<00:02:38.849> double<00:02:39.329> or<00:02:39.450> triple<00:02:39.659> and

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
after my first like double or triple and

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.660 
after my first like double or triple and
then<00:02:40.109> my<00:02:40.409> first<00:02:40.620> quad<00:02:40.920> kill<00:02:41.219> I<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.489> just

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
then my first quad kill I was just

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.479 
then my first quad kill I was just
hooked<00:02:41.819> ever<00:02:42.299> since<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.709> then<00:02:44.219> I<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.459> like

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
hooked ever since and then I was like

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.309 
hooked ever since and then I was like
man<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.090> didn't<00:02:45.389> even<00:02:45.450> realize<00:02:45.629> like<00:02:46.019> how<00:02:46.049> much

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
man I didn't even realize like how much

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.170 
man I didn't even realize like how much
it<00:02:46.439> could<00:02:46.500> help<00:02:46.650> towards<00:02:47.489> getting<00:02:47.700> tactical

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it could help towards getting tactical

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.390 
it could help towards getting tactical
nukes<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.540> mean<00:02:48.689> I've<00:02:48.810> some<00:02:49.290> sometimes<00:02:50.250> I'll

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
nukes I mean I've some sometimes I'll

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.979 
nukes I mean I've some sometimes I'll
get<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.549> quad<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.060> then<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.599> two<00:02:51.810> more

I choppers kind of a pain you can see
the<00:03:54.720> distance<00:03:55.109> on<00:03:55.319> this<00:03:55.439> map<00:03:55.680> especially<00:03:56.250> it's

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the distance on this map especially it's

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.729 
the distance on this map especially it's
like<00:03:56.970> you're<00:03:57.120> you're<00:03:57.509> coming<00:03:58.199> in<00:03:58.439> from

to start being able to kill people from
the<00:04:02.970> chopper<00:04:03.180> gunner<00:04:03.859> but<00:04:04.859> this<00:04:05.430> thing<00:04:05.639> does

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
the chopper gunner but this thing does

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.059 
the chopper gunner but this thing does
like<00:04:06.180> some<00:04:06.989> work<00:04:07.199> man<00:04:07.439> if<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.709> have<00:04:07.859> a<00:04:07.919> good

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
like some work man if you have a good

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.979 
like some work man if you have a good
connection<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:09.090> chopper<00:04:09.419> gunner<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.780> just

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
connection the chopper gunner is just

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.770 
connection the chopper gunner is just
crazy<00:04:10.379> and<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:11.040> my<00:04:11.189> opinion<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.120> lot<00:04:12.689> of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
crazy and in my opinion like a lot of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.330 
crazy and in my opinion like a lot of
times<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.079> I<00:04:13.169> get<00:04:13.319> into<00:04:13.470> three<00:04:13.739> bar<00:04:13.889> lobbies

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
times if I get into three bar lobbies

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.860 
times if I get into three bar lobbies
and<00:04:14.370> stuff<00:04:14.699> chopper<00:04:15.359> gunner<00:04:15.509> is<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.720> way<00:04:15.810> to

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
and stuff chopper gunner is the way to

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.990 
and stuff chopper gunner is the way to
go<00:04:16.049> versus<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.590> c-130<00:04:17.070> by<00:04:17.220> time<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.430> threw<00:04:17.909> it

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
go versus a c-130 by time you threw it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.270 
go versus a c-130 by time you threw it
on<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.090> burst<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.539> ac-130<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.979> usually

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
on the burst of the ac-130 it usually

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.430 
on the burst of the ac-130 it usually
lags<00:04:20.579> and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
lags and

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.900 
lags and
I<00:04:21.500> won't<00:04:21.890> be<00:04:22.010> able<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.220> get<00:04:22.310> actually<00:04:22.670> kills

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
I won't be able to get actually kills

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.000 
I won't be able to get actually kills
with<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.720> that's<00:04:23.930> something<00:04:24.260> I've<00:04:24.500> found

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
with it so that's something I've found

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.470 
with it so that's something I've found
so<00:04:25.250> maybe<00:04:25.400> that's<00:04:25.550> why<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:25.760> was<00:04:25.940> switching<00:04:26.240> up

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
so maybe that's why I was switching up

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.110 
so maybe that's why I was switching up
to<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.660> chopper<00:04:27.020> who<00:04:27.440> really<00:04:27.590> knows<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:28.220> chop

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120
