all<00:00:56.910> different<00:00:57.090> size<00:00:57.420> frames<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> mounts

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
all different size frames so it mounts

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.709 
all different size frames so it mounts
nicely<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.760> spring-loaded<00:01:00.030> inside

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
nicely and it's spring-loaded inside

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
nicely and it's spring-loaded inside
inside<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> frame<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.309> stays<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.879> there

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
inside the frame so it stays in there

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
inside the frame so it stays in there
nice<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.629> snug<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.650> bigger

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
nice and snug but if you up for bigger

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.149 
nice and snug but if you up for bigger
frames<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:05.970> expand<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:07.159> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
frames it can actually expand out and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.640 
frames it can actually expand out and
get<00:01:08.369> smaller<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.909> smaller<00:01:09.150> frames<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.049> one

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
get smaller for smaller frames so one

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.260 
get smaller for smaller frames so one
size<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> different<00:01:11.520> size<00:01:12.030> frame
