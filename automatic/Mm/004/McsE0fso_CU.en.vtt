00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.149 

I've<00:00:00.390> always<00:00:00.630> dreamed<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.319> giant<00:00:01.620> trusting

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
I've always dreamed of a giant trusting

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.919 
I've always dreamed of a giant trusting
system<00:00:02.580> that<00:00:02.850> pretty<00:00:03.210> much<00:00:03.419> covered<00:00:03.810> an

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
system that pretty much covered an

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.349 
system that pretty much covered an
entire<00:00:04.290> dance<00:00:04.680> floor<00:00:04.980> each<00:00:05.730> corner<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.270> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
entire dance floor each corner of the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.450 
entire dance floor each corner of the
dance<00:00:06.540> floor<00:00:06.779> had<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> totem<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:07.950> everything

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
dance floor had a totem and everything

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.690 
dance floor had a totem and everything
was<00:00:08.610> connected<00:00:09.059> by<00:00:09.240> overhead<00:00:09.929> truss<00:00:10.700> now

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
was connected by overhead truss now

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.549 
was connected by overhead truss now
unfortunately<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> only<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:13.080> enough<00:00:13.290> trust

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
unfortunately I only have enough trust

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.680 
unfortunately I only have enough trust
to<00:00:13.679> build<00:00:13.830> something<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.610> big<00:00:14.880> which

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to build something about this big which

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.779 
to build something about this big which
isn't<00:00:15.809> very<00:00:15.960> big<00:00:16.260> at<00:00:16.379> all<00:00:16.529> but<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.310> principles

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
isn't very big at all but the principles

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.510 
isn't very big at all but the principles
are<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.940> same<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.930> let's<00:00:19.109> go<00:00:19.260> ahead<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.680> look

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
are the same so let's go ahead and look

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.890 
are the same so let's go ahead and look
at<00:00:20.730> how<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:20.939> would<00:00:21.240> build<00:00:21.480> something<00:00:21.779> like

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
at how we would build something like

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.820 
at how we would build something like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
set up these blocks we're going to need

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.299 
set up these blocks we're going to need
12<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:57.120> couplers<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.829> they

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
12 of these couplers to do that and they

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.790 
12 of these couplers to do that and they
come<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.789> screws<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.230> screws<00:01:01.500> take<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
come with screws and the screws take a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.399 
come with screws and the screws take a
ten<00:01:02.100> millimeter<00:01:02.340> allen<00:01:02.930> which<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.229> right

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
ten millimeter allen which I have right

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.580 
ten millimeter allen which I have right
here<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> big<00:01:04.949> ten<00:01:05.220> mil<00:01:06.049> what<00:01:07.049> we're<00:01:07.200> gonna<00:01:07.290> do

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
here the big ten mil what we're gonna do

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.820 
here the big ten mil what we're gonna do
is<00:01:08.010> shoot<00:01:08.670> couplers<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.439> light<00:01:10.680> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
is shoot couplers off of this light you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.899 
is shoot couplers off of this light you
can<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.010> they're<00:01:11.189> already<00:01:11.310> attached<00:01:11.670> but

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
can see they're already attached but

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
can see they're already attached but
we'll<00:01:12.000> also<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:13.010> maybe<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> top

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
we'll also need them maybe here on top

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.270 
we'll also need them maybe here on top
and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.479> coming<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> side<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:17.159> make

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and then coming off to the side to make

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
and then coming off to the side to make
a<00:01:17.430> three-way<00:01:17.880> connection<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> way<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
a three-way connection now the way the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.320 
a three-way connection now the way the
couplers<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.090> pretty

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
couplers go on is actually pretty

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.730 
couplers go on is actually pretty
idiot-proof<00:01:21.750> you'll<00:01:22.200> notice<00:01:22.500> there's<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
idiot-proof you'll notice there's a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
idiot-proof you'll notice there's a
little<00:01:22.799> hole<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.810> look

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
little hole right here and if you look

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.560 
little hole right here and if you look
really<00:01:25.170> closely<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.400> coupler<00:01:26.759> you'll<00:01:27.299> see

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
really closely at the coupler you'll see

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.920 
really closely at the coupler you'll see
that<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:29.299> knob<00:01:30.299> sticking<00:01:30.810> out

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that there's a little knob sticking out

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
that there's a little knob sticking out
of<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.799> knobs<00:01:32.100> fits<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:33.060> into<00:01:33.360> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
of there that knobs fits right into that

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
of there that knobs fits right into that
hole<00:01:34.579> screw<00:01:35.579> fits<00:01:35.790> inside<00:01:37.189> take<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.400> allen

hole screw fits inside take your allen
and<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> tighten<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.630> down<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.650> can't<00:01:40.950> screw

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and you tighten it down you can't screw

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.940 
and you tighten it down you can't screw
up<00:01:41.280> positioning<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:41.939> way<00:01:42.680> now<00:01:43.680> when<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
up positioning this way now when you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.289 
up positioning this way now when you
have<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.579> simple<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> should<00:01:45.149> look

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
have it all as simple to should look

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.639 
have it all as simple to should look
something<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.960> you're<00:01:46.229> gonna<00:01:46.320> come

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
something like this you're gonna come

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.600 
something like this you're gonna come
off<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.610> side<00:01:47.880> off<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:49.140> side<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.619> either<00:01:49.890> up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
off this side off that side in either up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.700 
off this side off that side in either up
or<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.840> doesn't<00:01:52.140> matter<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> mean<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.590> I

or down it doesn't matter I mean if I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
or down it doesn't matter I mean if I
flip<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.070> upside<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.450> better

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
flip this upside down you can a better

today<00:02:14.780> we're<00:02:15.709> just<00:02:15.920> gonna<00:02:16.099> use<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.840> three

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
today we're just gonna use the three

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.710 
today we're just gonna use the three
sites<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.610> first<00:02:19.879> step<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:20.390> should<00:02:20.660> be

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
sites the first step to this should be

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.650 
sites the first step to this should be
to<00:02:21.140> take<00:02:21.349> all<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.709> your<00:02:22.310> vertical<00:02:23.239> pieces<00:02:23.450> of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
to take all of your vertical pieces of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.360 
to take all of your vertical pieces of
trust<00:02:24.040> detention<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.099> base<00:02:25.310> plates<00:02:27.040> now<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.069> big

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
trust detention to base plates now a big

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190 
trust detention to base plates now a big
trade<00:02:28.730> shows<00:02:29.000> I've<00:02:29.239> seen<00:02:29.540> people<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.050> like

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
trade shows I've seen people do it like

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.910 
trade shows I've seen people do it like
this<00:02:30.530> before<00:02:30.769> where<00:02:31.610> they've<00:02:31.940> taken<00:02:32.920> their

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
this before where they've taken their

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.420 
this before where they've taken their
two<00:02:34.099> blocks<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.739> then<00:02:36.860> they've<00:02:36.980> taken<00:02:37.190> their

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
two blocks and then they've taken their

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.460 
two blocks and then they've taken their
lengths<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.819> truss<00:02:40.959> attach<00:02:41.959> them<00:02:42.170> all<00:02:42.319> on<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
lengths of truss attach them all on the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.500 
lengths of truss attach them all on the
ground<00:02:45.730> no<00:02:46.730> matter<00:02:46.849> how<00:02:47.120> long<00:02:47.299> they<00:02:47.480> are

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
ground no matter how long they are

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.589 
ground no matter how long they are
because<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.230> something<00:02:48.440> like<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:52.599> they

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
because of something like this and they

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.960 
because of something like this and they
pin<00:02:53.840> everything<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:55.280> end<00:02:55.430> up<00:02:55.579> with<00:02:55.730> something

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
pin everything you end up with something

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.449 
pin everything you end up with something
like<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.690> then<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.769> build<00:02:57.980> another<00:02:58.280> one

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
like that and then you build another one

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.270 
like that and then you build another one
just<00:02:58.849> like<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.349> now<00:03:00.349> on<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.680> creation<00:03:01.040> you

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
just like that now on this creation you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.589 
just like that now on this creation you
just<00:03:01.489> built<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.849> take<00:03:02.090> another<00:03:02.329> piece<00:03:02.569> of

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
just built you take another piece of

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.770 
just built you take another piece of
truss<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.230> make<00:03:03.880> horizontal<00:03:04.880> attachment<00:03:05.630> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
truss and make horizontal attachment and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.030 
truss and make horizontal attachment and
secure<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.799> now<00:03:07.010> we<00:03:07.519> have<00:03:07.760> an<00:03:08.299> L<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.440> we<00:03:09.590> have<00:03:09.799> to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
secure it now we have an L so we have to

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.940 
secure it now we have an L so we have to
put<00:03:10.400> another<00:03:10.489> piece<00:03:10.849> of<00:03:10.910> drove<00:03:11.650> other<00:03:12.650> side

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
put another piece of drove other side

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.640 
put another piece of drove other side
making<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:17.600> next<00:03:17.930> step<00:03:18.109> is<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.500> take

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
making a you the next step is to take

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.180 
making a you the next step is to take
the<00:03:18.859> other<00:03:19.180> piece<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.359> told<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.810> build

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
the other piece I told you to build

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.129 
the other piece I told you to build
accommodation<00:03:22.190> blocks<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:23.180> attach<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.989> two

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
accommodation blocks and attach the two

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:31.449 
accommodation blocks and attach the two
together<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:29.380> now<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.680> have<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:31.010> do<00:03:31.130> is

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
together and now all you have to do is

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.030 
together and now all you have to do is
take<00:03:31.790> two<00:03:31.940> big<00:03:32.389> forklifts<00:03:33.170> pick<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:33.980> thing

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
take two big forklifts pick this thing

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.580 
take two big forklifts pick this thing
up<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.880> stick<00:03:35.209> your<00:03:35.389> truss<00:03:35.810> legs<00:03:36.139> underneath

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
up and stick your truss legs underneath

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.240 
up and stick your truss legs underneath
it<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.069> then<00:03:37.579> lower<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.030> onto<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.600> truss<00:03:38.780> legs

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it and then lower it onto the truss legs

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.309 
it and then lower it onto the truss legs
okay<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.670> say<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.060> don't<00:03:41.180> have<00:03:41.389> access<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.079> two

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
okay so say you don't have access to two

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.740 
okay so say you don't have access to two
big<00:03:42.650> forklifts<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.489> who<00:03:43.880> does<00:03:44.239> really<00:03:44.569> at

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
big forklifts and who does really at

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.690 
big forklifts and who does really at
most<00:03:44.959> gigs<00:03:45.260> here's<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.190> way<00:03:46.310> I<00:03:46.340> think<00:03:46.489> you

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
most gigs here's the way I think you

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.940 
most gigs here's the way I think you
could<00:03:46.850> probably<00:03:47.120> build<00:03:47.389> a<00:03:47.540> booth<00:03:47.720> with<00:03:48.350> three

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
could probably build a booth with three

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.309 
could probably build a booth with three
or<00:03:49.100> four<00:03:49.340> guys<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.450> couple<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.840> a-frame

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
or four guys and a couple of a-frame

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.710 
or four guys and a couple of a-frame
ladders<00:03:51.799> as<00:03:52.010> long<00:03:52.850> as<00:03:53.209> your<00:03:53.359> booth<00:03:53.510> isn't

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
ladders as long as your booth isn't

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.960 
ladders as long as your booth isn't
crazy<00:03:54.109> huge<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.650> size<00:03:54.829> I'm<00:03:55.489> thinking<00:03:55.880> you

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
crazy huge in size I'm thinking you

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.849 
crazy huge in size I'm thinking you
could<00:03:56.120> probably<00:03:56.299> go<00:03:56.599> maybe<00:03:57.049> nine<00:03:57.500> feet<00:03:57.829> tall

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
could probably go maybe nine feet tall

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.509 
could probably go maybe nine feet tall
and<00:03:58.340> possibly<00:03:59.090> 12<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.900> 15<00:04:00.349> feet<00:04:00.620> wide<00:04:01.160> on<00:04:01.220> your

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
and possibly 12 to 15 feet wide on your

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.000 
and possibly 12 to 15 feet wide on your
box<00:04:01.730> check<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.660> out<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.470> start<00:04:03.829> off<00:04:03.950> with

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
box check this out so you start off with

bit of play and when you're all done you

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.610 
bit of play and when you're all done you
should<00:05:32.270> have<00:05:32.480> something<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:33.080> looks<00:05:33.230> like

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
should have something that looks like

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.770 
should have something that looks like
this<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.810> hopefully<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.620> lot<00:05:37.220> taller<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:38.570> a

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
this but hopefully a lot taller and a

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.280 
this but hopefully a lot taller and a
lot<00:05:38.930> wider<00:05:39.940> so<00:05:40.940> although<00:05:41.180> this<00:05:41.570> is<00:05:41.780> as<00:05:41.960> close

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
lot wider so although this is as close

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.040 
lot wider so although this is as close
as<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:42.620> can<00:05:42.680> get<00:05:42.980> to<00:05:43.040> my<00:05:43.370> dream<00:05:43.940> trussing<00:05:44.600> set<00:05:44.900> up

you get the concept and that's how it's

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.320 
you get the concept and that's how it's
built<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:49.310> those<00:05:49.640> are<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.850> parts<00:05:50.090> that
