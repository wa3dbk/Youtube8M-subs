00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 and what may need an extension to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 home reasons can be very different 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.340
 need to expand due to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.740
 replenishment of the family to equip 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
 old house change architecture 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 Attach a veranda room or whole floor 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.350
 at home at first glance it may seem 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.500
 that the extension is much easier to build 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.119
 than santa is a misconception necessary 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.369
 take into account 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 year of building an old house for sure 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.420
 already and the foundation is not the same material 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 which they were used already 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.450
 old enough plus geometry in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.000
 construction time she is not so thorough 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.300
 observed as now in modern 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.649
 construction so when building new 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.590
 building to the old house is enough 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.649
 difficult besides to build them under the general 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 roof and take into account all the geometric 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.510
 The parameters are very problematic but 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.949
 no less possible precisely for this up 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.680
 start building is done 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.120
 preliminary design then working part in 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.699
 which takes into account all the little things and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 subtleties and only after that is given in 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.960
 work at home 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 By the way attachment with the old building 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.909
 may well become one 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.710
 in this case, the old rough house right 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.880
 build up glued construction 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.520
 timber in the future old 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.740
 the house will not sheathe too young tation 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 timber and and will look like 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.240
 new house spies fail can be done 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.340
 from different materials but glued timber in 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.840
 In this case, the optimum is due to 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.969
 the fact that for example rounded log 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.770
 or cutting requires long processing 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.920
 grinding and drying wood 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.569
 frame attachment is not to everyone's taste and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.759
 together docking with log house can lead 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.560
 yourself quite problematic but here 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.720
 glued timber is a known dry wood 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.970
 therefore not deformed by 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.340
 weather conditions conclusion we will discuss 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.530
 project deadlines 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.270
 building houses in general they are in general 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.520
 then all companies are about the same 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.429
 they may again depend on 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.179
 what pitfalls can float in 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.819
 construction time 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.140
 especially in the tenth century, is attached to this 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.750
 case two weeks 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.399
 construction period on marked this 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.200
 object if you need 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.569
 design build or department 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.040
 wooden house bath and sauna please contact 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.040
