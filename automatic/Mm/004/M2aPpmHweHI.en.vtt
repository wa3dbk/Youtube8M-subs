going<00:02:57.189> to<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.609> we're<00:02:57.760> going<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:57.909> cut<00:02:58.180> this

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
going to do is we're going to cut this

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.699 
going to do is we're going to cut this
four<00:02:58.900> wire<00:02:59.459> that<00:03:00.459> go<00:03:00.669> into<00:03:00.909> the<00:03:01.030> four<00:03:01.239> way<00:03:01.389> plug

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
four wire that go into the four way plug

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.289 
four wire that go into the four way plug
to<00:03:02.709> make<00:03:02.889> the<00:03:02.980> connection<00:03:03.400> directly<00:03:03.849> on<00:03:04.000> there

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
to make the connection directly on there

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.199 
to make the connection directly on there
and<00:03:04.480> if<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.379> look<00:03:05.560> at<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.799> fourth<00:03:06.609> wire<00:03:06.879> is

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
and if you look at the fourth wire is

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.699 
and if you look at the fourth wire is
the<00:03:07.389> ground<00:03:07.659> wire<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.169> has<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.379> white

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
the ground wire and that has a white

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.009 
the ground wire and that has a white
trace<00:03:09.099> wire<00:03:09.400> onto<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:10.120> black<00:03:10.359> cable<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
trace wire onto that black cable and

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.929 
trace wire onto that black cable and
that's<00:03:11.709> going<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.919> let<00:03:12.040> us<00:03:12.189> know<00:03:12.370> which<00:03:12.609> is<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
that's going to let us know which is the

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.020 
that's going to let us know which is the
first<00:03:13.209> wire<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.560> which<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.099> last<00:03:15.280> wire<00:03:15.579> so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
first wire and which is the last wire so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.020 
first wire and which is the last wire so
when<00:03:16.209> we<00:03:16.329> cut<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.720> we<00:03:17.019> cut<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.319> nice<00:03:17.439> and<00:03:17.470> flat

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
when we cut it we cut it nice and flat

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.670 
when we cut it we cut it nice and flat
we<00:03:19.030> don't<00:03:19.209> discard<00:03:19.689> this<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.139> case<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.439> got<00:03:20.590> to

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
we don't discard this in case I got to

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.319 
we don't discard this in case I got to
use<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.069> reference<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.760> come<00:03:21.939> back<00:03:22.150> and

first<00:03:57.849> because<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.329> have<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.629> remember<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
first because I have to remember the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.599 
first because I have to remember the
order<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.470> they're<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.799> very<00:04:00.129> important

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
order that they're in very important

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.729 
order that they're in very important
what<00:04:01.479> I<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.870> do<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.109> I<00:04:02.169> like<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.440> spread

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
what I like to do is I like to spread

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.939 
what I like to do is I like to spread
out<00:04:02.919> the<00:04:02.949> cabling<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.870> it's<00:04:05.019> much<00:04:05.229> easier<00:04:05.260> see

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
out the cabling so it's much easier see

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.670 
out the cabling so it's much easier see
see<00:04:06.639> the<00:04:06.849> cabling<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.329> thickest<00:04:07.870> wire<00:04:08.169> on<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
see the cabling the thickest wire on the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.099 
see the cabling the thickest wire on the
7-way<00:04:09.189> wire<00:04:09.459> plug<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.449> always<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.049> be

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
7-way wire plug is always going to be

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.990 
7-way wire plug is always going to be
the<00:04:11.349> white<00:04:11.560> wire<00:04:11.799> which<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.220> ground<00:04:12.340> wire

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
the white wire which is the ground wire

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.149 
the white wire which is the ground wire
I<00:04:13.379> spread<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.560> wire

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
I spread the wire

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.779 
I spread the wire
I<00:04:15.539> do<00:04:16.539> not<00:04:16.900> cut<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.320> wire<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:18.070> just<00:04:18.340> spread<00:04:18.609> the

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
I do not cut the wire I just spread the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.260 
I do not cut the wire I just spread the
insulation<00:04:19.449> apart<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.699> copper<00:04:22.150> is

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
insulation apart so the copper is

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.810 
insulation apart so the copper is
exposed<00:04:22.949> when<00:04:23.949> the<00:04:23.979> wires<00:04:24.280> are<00:04:24.550> underneath

then we apply the brake to make sure

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.149 
then we apply the brake to make sure
there's<00:05:14.169> a<00:05:14.259> difference<00:05:14.409> in<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.830> lighting

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
there's a difference in the lighting

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.119 
there's a difference in the lighting
while<00:05:16.029> the<00:05:16.210> parking<00:05:16.599> lights<00:05:16.779> are<00:05:16.960> on<00:05:17.129> because

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
while the parking lights are on because

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.409 
while the parking lights are on because
it's<00:05:18.309> always<00:05:18.460> going<00:05:18.699> to<00:05:18.729> be<00:05:18.789> different<00:05:19.240> and

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
it's always going to be different and

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.779 
it's always going to be different and
then<00:05:20.289> at<00:05:20.620> that<00:05:20.770> point<00:05:21.009> there<00:05:21.129> we<00:05:21.249> go<00:05:21.339> left<00:05:21.610> turn

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
then at that point there we go left turn

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.459 
then at that point there we go left turn
signal<00:05:22.210> make<00:05:22.539> sure<00:05:22.719> that<00:05:22.899> our<00:05:23.050> left<00:05:23.289> turn

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
signal make sure that our left turn

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.909 
signal make sure that our left turn
signal<00:05:23.949> is<00:05:24.039> scrolling<00:05:24.399> correctly<00:05:25.229> and<00:05:26.229> then

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
signal is scrolling correctly and then

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.719 
signal is scrolling correctly and then
we<00:05:27.039> go<00:05:27.189> right<00:05:27.399> turn<00:05:27.580> signal<00:05:27.899> and<00:05:28.899> then<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:30.099> also

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
we go right turn signal and then I also

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.209 
we go right turn signal and then I also
go<00:05:30.969> ahead<00:05:31.089> and<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.270> check<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.659> hazards<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:33.039> make

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
go ahead and I check the hazards to make

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.040 
go ahead and I check the hazards to make
sure<00:05:33.339> that<00:05:33.490> there's<00:05:33.699> ever<00:05:33.969> an<00:05:34.149> emergency<00:05:34.389> both

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
sure that there's ever an emergency both

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.459 
sure that there's ever an emergency both
sides<00:05:35.469> are<00:05:35.800> blinking<00:05:36.039> red<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.930> that's<00:05:38.169> why<00:05:38.409> it

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
sides are blinking red and that's why it

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:49.230 
sides are blinking red and that's why it
is<00:05:38.620> our<00:05:38.740> reverse<00:05:38.979> lights<00:05:39.310> right<00:05:39.520> there
