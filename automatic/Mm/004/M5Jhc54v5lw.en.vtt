00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 because you took me several days 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.700
 quiet until yesterday afternoon 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.220
 when he registered a strong exhalation 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.040
 but after the installation was registered 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.929
 something that I do not know that it is I do not know how 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.969
 explain it let's see them let's see them 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.969
 together miner falling on it in the crater 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.450
 this 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.390
 there is this that falls in the crater before 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.760
 this did not present it yesterday because 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 we look for specialists that until today we 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.469
 they gave these explanations look 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.899
 these are images captured by the 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.850
 television camera located on the hill 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.969
 also money very close to the volcano 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.219
 popocatÃ©petl according to specialists 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.559
 it's about an object of about one 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.110
 kilometer long by 200 meters of 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.539
 wide you can not appreciate where 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.199
 comes but with a speed greater than 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.149
 of an airplane 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.149
 it seems like it enters the crater 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.970
 so you see it up close is a body 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.740
 cylindrical, an excess of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.300
 glitter on its front face and a shadow 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.410
 we went with the astronomer of the unam and 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.170
 member of the astronomical union 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.540
 international that has reviewed in detail 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.240
 the luminous objects seen in the area 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.510
 15 days ago and last April when the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.420
 volcano recorded greater activity one thing 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.120
 interesting in all this is that it goes on 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.840
 drop 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.960
 would be even more spectacular if it were 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.980
 in your life when it 's something that is falling 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.250
 as there are more natural causes than 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.260
 when it goes up he ruled out 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.480
 incandescent material released by the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.910
 volcano and returning in freefall 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.790
 because you can not see a path of 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.230
 light drawn by the body in movement 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.490
 same situation that rules out the 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.080
 possibility of it being a meteorite 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.660
 catches the attention of astronomers 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.000
 certain characteristics of this object 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.280
 on the one hand that has a good line 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.980
 defined that the edges are bright 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.440
 and of different colors but above all 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.920
 that the interaction with the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.620
 atmosphere or with the gases of the volcano 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.850
 imagine a one kilometer cylinder 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.480
 long and 200 meters wide and two 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.739
 streets wide and one kilometer long 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.200
 in an area where there is apart from the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.150
 terrestrial atmosphere because they are all 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.489
 these gases exhalations and all hot 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.590
 you would expect an explosive phenomenon like 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.930
 more smoke gases a different light and 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.930
 sound nothing is seen or heard 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.819
 the specialist assured that even 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.230
 it may be a video defect 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.709
 that many of the pixels in the image 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.940
 are saturated then like a 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:09.549
 it was lightning or something like it looked like 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:12.040
 that is not part of the original video a 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.560
 single image for scientists said the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.230
 Astronomer is not enough to do 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.590
 an assertion is a phenomenon 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.150
 interesting you have to be attentive but 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.910
 confirmation is needed and sara and mendez 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.000
 television news 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.920
 but we saw it now in slow motion like this 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.730
 it's how our camera registered it 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.730
 is permanently 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.870
 that is in slow motion 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.870
 so he recorded it exactly like that 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.200
 well then it's the original record 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.810
 good in the weekend we will look 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.260
 more explanations with specialists 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 While
