pawn<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> e<00:01:01.559> pawn<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.940> type<00:01:03.180> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
pawn for the e pawn and in this type of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.730 
pawn for the e pawn and in this type of
position<00:01:03.739> we<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.280> another<00:01:06.000> weakness<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
position we see that another weakness of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
position we see that another weakness of
having<00:01:07.740> doubled<00:01:08.040> pawns<00:01:08.159> comes<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.760> light<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
having doubled pawns comes to light and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.789 
having doubled pawns comes to light and
something<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:10.020> highlight<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.680> as

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
something that we will highlight more as

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.620 
something that we will highlight more as
we<00:01:10.920> talk<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.549> advantages<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.210> want<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
we talk about the advantages you want to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.149 
we talk about the advantages you want to
be<00:01:12.720> able<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.930> recognize<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.770> terms<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
be able to recognize in terms of the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.170 
be able to recognize in terms of the
pollens<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.670> look<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.939> chessboard

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
pollens when you look at a chessboard

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.350 
pollens when you look at a chessboard
which<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.890> ability<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> passed

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
which is the ability to have a passed

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
which is the ability to have a passed
pawn<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.320> majority<00:01:19.799> which<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.369> lead<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
pawn and a majority which can lead to a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.920 
pawn and a majority which can lead to a
passed<00:01:20.909> pawn<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.509> White<00:01:21.720> has<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
passed pawn here White has a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.530 
passed pawn here White has a
four-on-three<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
four-on-three and that's because this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.990 
four-on-three and that's because this
pawn<00:01:24.840> left<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> D<00:01:25.710> file<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.369> went<00:01:26.610> over<00:01:26.759> here

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
pawn left the D file and went over here

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
pawn left the D file and went over here
black<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.630> course<00:01:27.840> also<00:01:28.170> has<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> four-on-three

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
black of course also has a four-on-three

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
black of course also has a four-on-three
you<00:01:29.130> may<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.340> saying<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.880> black's<00:01:30.150> pawn

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you may be saying but black's pawn

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
you may be saying but black's pawn
structure<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.530> nearly<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:31.979> mobilers

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
structure is not nearly as mobilers

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
structure is not nearly as mobilers
effective<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> double<00:01:33.869> pawns<00:01:34.079> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
effective because of the double pawns so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.260 
effective because of the double pawns so
that's<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> quick<00:01:35.220> example<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.759> how<00:01:35.820> doubled

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that's a quick example of how doubled

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.600 
that's a quick example of how doubled
pawns<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.750> backfire<00:01:37.200> chess<00:01:37.590> game<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:38.009> here

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
pawns can backfire chess game now here

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.550 
pawns can backfire chess game now here
black<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:39.240> other<00:01:39.420> compensation<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
black has some other compensation for it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.319

let's take a quick look at a very common
way<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.200> an<00:02:04.290> isolated<00:02:04.500> Queen<00:02:05.040> pawn<00:02:05.250> has

you can reach an IQ P but one of the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.510 
you can reach an IQ P but one of the

Bishop to d2 or both moves and let's say

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970 
Bishop to d2 or both moves and let's say
a<00:02:30.360> few<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.780> moves<00:02:31.020> are<00:02:31.170> made<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.830> would

a few more moves are made we would

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.940 
a few more moves are made we would
actually<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:33.030> very<00:02:33.600> common<00:02:34.140> example<00:02:34.710> of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
actually see a very common example of

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.450 
actually see a very common example of
what<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.520> talking<00:02:35.940> about<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.480> terms<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
what I was talking about in terms of the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.580 
what I was talking about in terms of the
isolated<00:02:39.000> pawn<00:02:39.300> potentially<00:02:39.930> offering<00:02:40.410> good

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.230 
isolated pawn potentially offering good
play<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.340> see<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.490> position<00:02:41.910> where<00:02:42.060> though

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
play here we see a position where though

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.330 
play here we see a position where though
the<00:02:42.420> pawn<00:02:42.630> itself<00:02:43.080> unbias<00:02:43.560> Lee<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.160> course

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
the pawn itself unbias Lee is of course

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.030 
the pawn itself unbias Lee is of course
a<00:02:44.460> weakness<00:02:44.820> white<00:02:45.570> actually<00:02:45.810> has<00:02:46.200> good<00:02:46.530> open

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
a weakness white actually has good open

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040 
a weakness white actually has good open
space<00:02:47.340> for<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.700> pieces<00:02:48.120> his<00:02:48.510> pawn<00:02:48.840> is

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.540 
space for the pieces his pawn is
slightly<00:02:49.350> more<00:02:49.590> further<00:02:49.830> advanced<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.460> the

and E nature will definitely favor white

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.040 
and E nature will definitely favor white
as<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.790> don't<00:02:57.000> dismiss<00:02:57.420> isolated<00:02:57.870> queen

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
as well so don't dismiss isolated queen

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.330 
as well so don't dismiss isolated queen
pawn<00:02:58.200> positions<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.740> one<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.190> just

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
pawn positions as one that you just

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.590 
pawn positions as one that you just
don't<00:02:59.490> want<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.790> play<00:03:00.000> they're<00:03:00.180> very<00:03:00.390> dynamic

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
don't want to play they're very dynamic

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.810 
don't want to play they're very dynamic
and<00:03:00.990> lots<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.350> fun<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.800> leave<00:03:02.250> lots<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.640> room

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
and lots of fun and leave lots of room

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.130 
and lots of fun and leave lots of room
to<00:03:02.850> outplay<00:03:03.240> your<00:03:03.450> opponent<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:03.960> you're<00:03:04.110> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
to outplay your opponent if you're a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.450 
to outplay your opponent if you're a
stronger<00:03:04.500> player<00:03:04.830> whether<00:03:05.100> you're<00:03:05.250> playing

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460

against<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.910> weakness<00:03:06.210> or<00:03:06.360> for<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> weakness

against the weakness or for the weakness

against the weakness or for the weakness
so<00:03:07.230> there's<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.620> quick<00:03:07.860> example<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.400> an<00:03:08.520> opening

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
so there's a quick example of an opening

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.130 
so there's a quick example of an opening
the<00:03:08.970> can<00:03:09.120> reach<00:03:09.240> an<00:03:09.390> isolated<00:03:09.780> Queen<00:03:09.930> pawn

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the can reach an isolated Queen pawn

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.050
