00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.730
 and threats must Belarusian army 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.590

 armed forces in modern conditions 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.180
 among other things we are talking about raising 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 military readiness and technical 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.890
 modernization rearmament particular 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.869

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 fighter attack aircraft in general in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.780
 last year all the equipment in the army was 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 almost completely tested 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.770
 restored besides Alexander 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 Lukashenko instructed to more actively use 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.180
 potential defense enterprises question 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.100
 composed 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 that we could adapt 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 first of all our armed forces 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.760
 army to respond to that situation 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 which may be formed tomorrow do not let 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.350
 god of course the day after tomorrow and so on then 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.820
 have we constantly appeal to this 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 the issue of systems that conditions change 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.189
 let there not dramatically we see that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.340
 happening in the so-called theaters 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 hostilities due to conflicts and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.400
 enough we study them but naturally we are not 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.420
 we can not respond given our 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.020
 the situation therefore has to be somewhere 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.090
 adapt to change situation 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.619
 methods of warfare 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 if you have to defend the country therefore 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.360
 here at the appointment of a new minister 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.729
 defense was tasked with preparing him 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.409
 vision his vision 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.740
 Brandy General Staff of our country 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.470
 prospects of creation as I often say 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.350
 mobile 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.920
 adequate army of our armed forces 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.119
 countries in general 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.670
 Today Alexander Lukashenko spoke 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.320
 before the commanding staff of the armed forces 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.330
 since the last such meetings 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.430
 four years have passed since then 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.680
 many events in the international arena 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.900
 which somehow relates to the development 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.640
 armed forces of Belarus growth 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.260
 separatist sentiment in Europe 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.300
 surge of international terrorism 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.820
 aggravating contradictions between Russia and 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.709
 bloc nato states also military 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.140
 standoff in neighboring Ukraine 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.150
 all this suggests that the situation in 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.410
 the world around belarus becomes 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.090
 more unstable 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.650
 under these conditions, the president said 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.780
 the importance of such 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.880
 fundamental concepts like the world 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.709
 stability and safety of them 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.580
 provision is the main task 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.320
 Belarusian army in difficult conditions 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.450
 current international situation 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.140
 economic difficulties we are with 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.910
 confidence we can state 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.269
 internal political situation in Belarus 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.840
 stays stable I'll tell you frankly 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.600
 our people appreciate it in society 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.390
 significantly increased the importance of such 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.450
 concepts like safety and care 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.180
 states about man is everything 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.470
 reason to believe that achievement 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.160
 the current government will be appreciated 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.650
 appreciated by Belarusians and you know if 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.560
 some used to say here 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.010
 Lukashenko forcing the situation 5-7 years 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.180
 ago such words were heard that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 we spend unknown money 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.620
 invest in upgrading weapons 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.900
 improving our army today 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.549
 especially after the events in Ukraine all 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.819
 understand that you need to feed their soldiers and 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.920
 Army must have 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.689
 sufficient to ensure 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.389
 own interests 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:54.400
 but the situation is calm in our country 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.150
 This does not mean that we can afford 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.450
 allow 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.489
 relax especially i already have it now 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.750
 spoke in narrow composition after a series 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.510
 events that occurred on that 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.030
 Our brotherly Ukraine in Belarus 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.849
 no one can think today that everything 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.870
 well you understand we are great here 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.750
 peacekeepers are intermediaries and for this we 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.539
 someone will pay and we will have peace and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.190
 rest do not be fooled further 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:30.099
 I emphasize once again to us calm 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.340
 life is not guaranteed we will do 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.449
 all that this life was calm but still 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.360
 I emphasize again 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.150
 we need to have bayes of combat capable 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.960
 Above all, yes and all armed 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.090
 if we need strength we must be able to protect 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.090
 independence and sovereignty of our country 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.690
 but we will never get involved 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.000
 stupid brainless confrontation with anyone 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.020
 whatever we will be pursuing 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.970
 reasonable restrained policy to us someone else 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.690
 do n't give your way 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.460
 this is the essence of our policy if you need to 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.289
 it die we will die for it 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.150
 today along with conceptual themes 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.250
 at the meeting were discussed and practical 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.750
 issues of ordering in the garrisons and 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.180
 military units social security 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.370
 military fortifications professional 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.780
 officer training in 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.520
 end of the meeting of the Minister of Defense 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.740
 Alexander Lukashenko gave a copy 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.479

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:13.440
 I will never get you involved but if I have to 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.139
 defend your land and stand back 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.900
