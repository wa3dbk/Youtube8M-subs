00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.360
 those of canon he got in touch 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.559

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 a little gift that was a video camera 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.110
 it's a tiny little camera that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.800
 occupies this part of my hand is called 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.090
 mini joy and the truth that good 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.489
 As you can see the truth, it seems to me that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 It's great because I see the whole box 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 the record button and I'm already recording or 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 be I not read instruction or anything by 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.050
 the style so nothing today we're going to do 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 a very quick recipe that is a one clothes 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.470
 old because someone says cooked 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.800
 from Madrid and today he touches the clothes so 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.290
 nothing now is here as bisbal then nothing 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.050
 here we are with the recipe 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.020
 the works of the yesterday chickpea stew 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.590
 a little bacon sausage morcilla 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.560
 canary morcilla chicken potato 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.900
 little broth of broth good as 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.600
 see rated that means 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.210
 that the day is very well done 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.070
 I did myself and a little tomato nothing 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.140
 Fried tomato does not need to tear 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.810
 the garments making a tomato 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.680
 natural following the oil then 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.120
 we start with a sofrito the sofrito what 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.330
 we make onion 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.960
 minced musicality 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.960
 OK 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.149
 that nothing like you see 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.600
 totally let that said success for the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.600
 another world 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.830
 and a little water garlic now 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.650
 we add after the onion not before 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.650
 because good that we add it 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.569
 before the onion then the safest thing 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.209
 it's not that my response gives the feeling 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.190
 of bitterness in food what we 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.770
 matters is the taste that has no bass 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.040
 what is golden simply 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.920
 we add now with the onion and from 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.150
 that form of the only information more 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.230
 I do not know what this method is that also 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.329
 it could be 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.760
 oars a little suddenly I 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.200
 pulled out a miraculous spoon that has 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.200
 have to cut a little because he has not given me 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.769
 mind that the camera doing in the middle 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.769
 of the candle 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.280
 we can be a little salt like that and 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.230
 that helps the onion to get more 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.230
 pretty because it hurts 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.500
 nothing is simply here 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.500
 stinging 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.980
 if you see that it gives us time then first 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:33.980
 apply all the onion or meat 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.140
 And finally, when you have 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.140
 all chopped up because it would just be catch 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.170
 and fighting instead of doing it at the same time 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.620
 put each one so they see more or 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.960
 less size has to do it 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.450
 so that you do not burn things and that 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.180
 everything is done in its time 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.750
 Well now I'm going to cut a little bit 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.750
 of the camera 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.099
 but I'll leave it as it is 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.920
 when I already have everything and almost all 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.920
 digital prize because now we go back 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.450
 Well then we are already then 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.620
 we have almost all the room all minced 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.330
 limited 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.330
 we wait for the last chickpeas 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.150
 a few should not abuse too much 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.110
 they are ingredients more or less 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.110
 that there is a little bit of everything 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.770
 if we were not cabbage well 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.810
 we can be I have made the broth 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.910
 Well, because it's good because it 's good 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.789
 because from one day to the next you can not 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.380
 Zoom in a little in the fridge and then 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.780
 the broth helps them turn to 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.259
 moisturize and good is much richer 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.259
 more juicy 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.020
 comes 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.740
 the tomato the fried the last 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.569
 if we make natural tomato crushed or 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.160
 let's fight, we chopped what 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.099
 so we would throw it before the 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.599
 broth and let it be fried I know a 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.789
 little with the rest but like the tomato 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.479
 fried because we already throw it out directly 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.479
 next to the broth 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.980
 and I'm pointed out that old clothes 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.790
 we would go up a little to the fire so that 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.250
 boil is reduced to the thick broth and 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.620
 we would end up serving vale then 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.740
 now in about 5 minutes or so 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.660
 when it starts to boil it will be 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:39.680
 we finished I show the result 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.980
 Well, we already have the old clothes consumed 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:48.340
 almost all the caldito but leaving it a 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.340
 little juicy and is as well as syrupy 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.180
 and simply what I have not told you is 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.490
 that of course you have to salt 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.020
 because already cooked, if we miss him 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.449
 salt at the time because I did not need 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.969
 Well, now 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.340
 you already have enough good we read in 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.370
 the script and remove 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.520
 And here 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:12.090
 we have our rich rich old clothes 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.199
 rich to eat with a little bread a 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.479
 white wine for example or a young 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:20.610
 red and nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.570
 and the member and I have gone recipe did not 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.570
 criticize a lot please
