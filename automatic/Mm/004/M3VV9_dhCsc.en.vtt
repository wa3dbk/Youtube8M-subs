is to talk about one of the biggest
feelings<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.270> game<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.749> far<00:02:06.929> and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
feelings of the game so far and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.979 
feelings of the game so far and
everyone's<00:02:08.280> talented<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.090> incredibly

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
everyone's talented it's the incredibly

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.710 
everyone's talented it's the incredibly
fragile<00:02:10.470> spawn<00:02:11.190> system<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.819> Newtown<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.450> just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
fragile spawn system and Newtown is just

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.559 
fragile spawn system and Newtown is just
the<00:02:13.080> biggest<00:02:13.410> exhibition<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:15.180> reason

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
the biggest exhibition of it the reason

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.080 
the biggest exhibition of it the reason
that<00:02:15.599> i<00:02:15.810> sat<00:02:16.230> down<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.739> my<00:02:16.799> side<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> map

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that i sat down on my side of the map

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.570 
that i sat down on my side of the map
and<00:02:18.360> count<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.049> building<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.739> had<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and count that building was I had the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.660 
and count that building was I had the
idea<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.780> could<00:02:21.900> anchor<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.739> spawn<00:02:23.010> this

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
idea that I could anchor the spawn this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.430 
idea that I could anchor the spawn this
game<00:02:23.910> was<00:02:24.060> free<00:02:24.299> on<00:02:24.330> free<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.049> way<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.379> it

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
game was free on free all the way for it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.380 
game was free on free all the way for it
so<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.769> fair<00:02:25.980> match<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.549> mean<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.180> still

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
so it's a fair match I mean it still

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.670 
so it's a fair match I mean it still
ended<00:02:27.660> pretty<00:02:27.930> quick<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:31.470> fought

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
ended pretty quick but I just fought

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.440 
ended pretty quick but I just fought
with<00:02:31.860> free<00:02:32.069> free<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.459> free<00:02:32.700> we<00:02:33.060> could<00:02:33.209> anchor

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
with free free on free we could anchor

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.360 
with free free on free we could anchor
the<00:02:33.840> spawns<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.349> actually<00:02:34.769> just<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.160> good

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the spawns and actually just have a good

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.789 
the spawns and actually just have a good
game<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:36.569> other<00:02:36.720> two<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.440> game<00:02:37.620> we're

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
game the other two in the game we're

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.250

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
trying to keep the map well so it's like

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.259 
trying to keep the map well so it's like
a<00:02:51.780> game<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.349> two<00:02:52.620> halves<00:02:52.860> there<00:02:53.670> half<00:02:53.970> hour

just<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:06.329> anchor<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.109> spawn<00:03:07.380> with<00:03:07.980> me<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.489> they

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
just to anchor the spawn with me so they

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.789 
just to anchor the spawn with me so they
were<00:03:08.819> all<00:03:09.030> spawning<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.959> side<00:03:10.230> it's

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799

10 meters behind you
the<00:03:59.830> spawns<00:04:00.159> are<00:04:00.400> so<00:04:00.640> fragile<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.209> nearly

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
the spawns are so fragile it is nearly

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.990 
the spawns are so fragile it is nearly
impossible<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.860> spawn<00:04:03.099> trap<00:04:03.370> unless<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.790> like

impossible to spawn trap unless you like

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.610 
impossible to spawn trap unless you like
spawn<00:04:04.330> trapping<00:04:04.599> from<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.080> massive

distance<00:04:06.370> away<00:04:06.840> they're<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:08.099> ridiculously

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
distance away they're just ridiculously

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.580

fragile<00:04:09.819> ice<00:04:10.030> which<00:04:10.450> far<00:04:10.840> too<00:04:11.049> easily<00:04:11.260> and

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
fragile ice which far too easily and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.860 
fragile ice which far too easily and
they<00:04:11.650> need<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.069> be<00:04:12.190> fixed<00:04:12.430> at<00:04:13.209> least<00:04:13.420> in<00:04:13.569> my

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
they need to be fixed at least in my

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.460 
they need to be fixed at least in my
opinion<00:04:15.419> and<00:04:16.419> Newtown<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:17.019> course<00:04:17.199> is<00:04:17.350> the

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
opinion and Newtown of course is the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.920 
opinion and Newtown of course is the
epitome<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.160> after<00:04:18.910> this<00:04:19.269> new<00:04:19.449> town<00:04:19.690> game

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
epitome of that after this new town game

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.900 
epitome of that after this new town game
I<00:04:20.169> don't<00:04:20.650> know<00:04:20.709> why<00:04:20.829> people<00:04:20.859> want<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.489> keep

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
I don't know why people want to keep

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.450 
I don't know why people want to keep
exposing<00:04:22.360> themselves<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:23.050> this<00:04:23.260> map<00:04:23.530> we

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
exposing themselves to this map we

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.040 
exposing themselves to this map we
played<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.820> five<00:04:25.090> more<00:04:25.330> times<00:04:25.510> after<00:04:25.780> because

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
played it five more times after because

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.960 
played it five more times after because
it<00:04:26.139> kept<00:04:26.320> winning<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.620> vote<00:04:26.770> really<00:04:27.699> annoying

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
it kept winning the vote really annoying

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.420 
it kept winning the vote really annoying
but<00:04:28.630> anyway<00:04:28.900> nothing<00:04:29.500> about<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.250> is

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
but anyway nothing about that this is

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.680 
but anyway nothing about that this is
