going to show you the passenger side now

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.370 
going to show you the passenger side now
step<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.890> here<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.560> take<00:00:25.560> out<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.160> seat<00:00:26.910> as

slides<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.480> she<00:00:42.629> does<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:43.550> now<00:00:44.550> accessing<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
slides up she does not now accessing the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
slides up she does not now accessing the
bolt<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> rear<00:00:47.489> seat<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> little

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
bolt on the rear seat is a little

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.779 
bolt on the rear seat is a little
difficult<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:51.739> mmm<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.039> need<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.489> get

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
difficult because mmm you need to get

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
difficult because mmm you need to get
that<00:00:54.480> bolt<00:00:54.780> way<00:00:54.960> down<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.350> good<00:00:58.350> luck

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that bolt way down there so good luck

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.209 
that bolt way down there so good luck
with<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.899> it's<00:01:00.899> easier<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.590> access<00:01:01.739> these

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
with that it's easier to access these

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.080 
with that it's easier to access these
bolts<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> come<00:01:03.090> through<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> trunk<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
bolts if you come through the trunk and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.170 
bolts if you come through the trunk and
use<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> rather<00:01:06.420> large<00:01:06.780> extension<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.180> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
use a rather large extension and to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.670 
use a rather large extension and to
access<00:01:10.049> those<00:01:10.820> okay<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.840> Velcro

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
access those okay now you have a Velcro

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.399 
access those okay now you have a Velcro
covered<00:01:14.070> carpet<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:16.700> here's<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.170> fender<00:01:19.170> for

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
covered carpet and here's the fender for

covered carpet and here's the fender for
the<00:01:19.470> passenger<00:01:19.890> side<00:01:22.700> now<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.970> thing<00:01:24.270> is

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the passenger side now this thing is

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.210 
the passenger side now this thing is
sealed<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.320> some<00:01:25.350> sort<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> RTV

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
sealed on there with some sort of RTV

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.969 
sealed on there with some sort of RTV
your<00:01:26.700> gasket<00:01:27.509> material<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> got<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> pry

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
your gasket material so you got to pry

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.660 
your gasket material so you got to pry
it<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> there's<00:01:29.880> no<00:01:30.509> magic<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.549> rip<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it up there's no magic to it just rip it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.010 
it up there's no magic to it just rip it
up

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
up

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.160 
up
you'll<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.800> that<00:01:35.040> there's<00:01:35.480> some<00:01:36.480> fuel

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you'll see that there's some fuel

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.150 
you'll see that there's some fuel
attachments<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.800> here

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
attachments on here

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.750 
attachments on here
now<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.730> is<00:01:38.850> pressurized<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> my<00:01:41.460> advice

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
now this is pressurized so my advice

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.480 
now this is pressurized so my advice
would<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.510> go<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.740> other<00:01:43.890> side<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
would be to go to the other side and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.420 
would be to go to the other side and
disconnect<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.860> if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.040> already<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
disconnect the if you already have it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.330 
disconnect the if you already have it
open<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> disconnect<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.340> electrical

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
open that is disconnect the electrical

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.920 
open that is disconnect the electrical
leads<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.880> lead<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.330> fuel<00:01:51.510> pump<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
leads that lead to the fuel pump and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.010 
leads that lead to the fuel pump and
then<00:01:52.890> start<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> car<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.000> run<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.810> told

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
then start the car and run it told

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.500 
then start the car and run it told
stalls<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:56.010> course<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.820> could<00:01:56.970> also<00:01:57.090> pull<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
stalls of course you could also pull the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.880 
stalls of course you could also pull the
fuel<00:01:57.720> pump<00:01:57.869> relay<00:01:58.050> out<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.650> don't<00:01:58.800> know

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
fuel pump relay out but I don't know

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
fuel pump relay out but I don't know
what<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.190> so<00:01:59.550> this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.450> easier<00:02:00.570> for

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
what that is so this is just easier for

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.880 
what that is so this is just easier for
me<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:02.369> you'll<00:02:02.550> see<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.940> fuel<00:02:03.180> ring<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.890> if

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
me but you'll see the fuel ring and if

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.010 
me but you'll see the fuel ring and if
you<00:02:05.010> notice<00:02:05.280> mine<00:02:05.520> has<00:02:05.820> these<00:02:06.660> green

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you notice mine has these green

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.490 
you notice mine has these green
indicators<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.950> they<00:02:08.880> were<00:02:08.940> lined<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.500> when

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
indicators here they were lined up when

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.990 
indicators here they were lined up when
we<00:02:10.590> started<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.100> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.640> line<00:02:11.880> them

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
we started you want to do that line them

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.120 
we started you want to do that line them
up<00:02:12.120> when<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> put<00:02:12.540> back<00:02:12.660> together<00:02:12.810> but<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
up when you put back together but you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.080 
up when you put back together but you
can<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.610> now<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.940> free<00:02:19.760> okay<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.820> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
can see that now it's free okay so the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.449 
can see that now it's free okay so the
hole<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.630> not<00:02:22.140> exactly<00:02:22.530> centered<00:02:22.890> over<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
hole is not exactly centered over the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.180 
hole is not exactly centered over the
sky<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:25.140> might<00:02:25.290> want<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.500> protect<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> carpet

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
sky you might want to protect the carpet

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.670 
sky you might want to protect the carpet
a<00:02:26.220> little<00:02:26.370> bit<00:02:26.459> like<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.700> did<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.450> when<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.530> get

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
a little bit like I did so when you get

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
guy around doing too much damage to get

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:51.510 
guy around doing too much damage to get
it<00:02:40.110> out

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.650 

but<00:02:52.520> easy<00:02:52.730> with<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.180> hand<00:02:53.890> now<00:02:56.740> clipped<00:02:57.740> here

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
but easy with one hand now clipped here

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:09.010 
but easy with one hand now clipped here
hold<00:02:59.660> on<00:02:59.810> stop<00:03:00.050> okay<00:03:07.330> now<00:03:08.330> you've<00:03:08.540> got<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.870> out

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.930 
hold on stop okay now you've got it out
and<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:11.000> looks<00:03:11.210> like<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:12.520> don't<00:03:13.520> know<00:03:13.700> if<00:03:13.760> that's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
and it looks like I don't know if that's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.900 
and it looks like I don't know if that's
another<00:03:14.180> fuel<00:03:14.540> pump<00:03:14.840> or<00:03:15.620> not<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.460> here's<00:03:16.730> your

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
another fuel pump or not but here's your

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.560 
another fuel pump or not but here's your
sender<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.560> there's<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.640> pickup<00:03:19.940> tube<00:03:20.210> there

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
sender and there's the pickup tube there

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.770 
sender and there's the pickup tube there
for<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.710> fuel<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> essentially<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.600> just
