00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 these people or because of this evil are 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.109
 suffering both residents and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.900
 natural resources in the municipality 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.210
 spine south of Peru let's see 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.040
 next form 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.650
 that determine risk values 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.720
 telling the truth cost him the job the 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.730
 doctor Fernando Suarez says it was 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.770
 thrown out of the ministry of health when 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.290
 made public the results of analysis 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.740
 made in 2013 to residents of espinar 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.869
 where the Glencore mining company operates 100% 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.750
 of them have their body 11 metals 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.470
 heavy as uranium in a year of 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.120
 foment to the reagent ok and in its progeny 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:47.110
 generates radon 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:50.530
 and this one damages the kidney not the beryllium is a 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.220
 carcinogenic not the antimony we 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.850
 poison the nickel is another poison this 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.530
 cobalt also in 2010 and 2012 the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.260
 population of spine had already been 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.439
 evaluated all had concentrations of 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.450
 mercury lead arsenic and cadmium by 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.670
 above the values allowed by the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.079
 world health organization its 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.210
 natural resources 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.700
 they were also contaminated 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.710
 the peasants in the area point out that 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.420
 many of their water sources love before 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.430
 streams that were used for their consumption 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.500
 human and for irrigation have decreased 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.070
 they are contaminated and that is affecting 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.690
 terribly their quality of life and is 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.360
 being attended but in one dimension 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.970
 still insignificant totally insufficient 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.729
 regarding the needs raised and 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.119
 the environment ministry reported that 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.009
 the state will invest in 2015 about 78 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.190
 millions of dollars to counter 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.830
 the affectation to the spine population 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.780
 this reaction will be after five years 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.450
 from the first analyzes and until the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.190
 date have not been established 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.530
 responsibilities for pollution 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.259
 we need to do not study much more 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.690
 deep because it is necessary 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.729
 differentiate how much is the contribution of the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.039
 nature being a logical mining area 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.320
 of how much is what the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.660
 activity and neca to be like this then in 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.209
 that is working and after that 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.830
 comes the next question as to 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.220
 answer the fact that who is the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.560
 responsable 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.870
 while the state investigates the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 transnational glencore strata continues 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.830
 operating in the area where the protests 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.590
 against mining activity in 2012 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.790
 concluded with two civilians who died and 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.490
 hundreds of injured 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.490
