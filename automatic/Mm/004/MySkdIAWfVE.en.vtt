00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
a constant frame rate of maybe upwards

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.600 
a constant frame rate of maybe upwards
of<00:01:08.759> 60<00:01:09.270> frames<00:01:09.600> per<00:01:09.750> second<00:01:10.380> i'd<00:01:11.130> probably<00:01:11.399> pay

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
files got to go get a video game i would

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.370 
files got to go get a video game i would
i<00:01:23.060> would<00:01:23.180> definitely<00:01:23.510> get<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.810> newer<00:01:23.960> version

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
i would definitely get the newer version

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.600 
i would definitely get the newer version
on<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.530> older<00:01:24.770> version<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.310> i<00:01:25.430> would

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
on the older version and i would

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.460 
on the older version and i would
definitely<00:01:25.850> want<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.120> be<00:01:26.360> tied<00:01:26.930> with<00:01:26.960> the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
definitely want to be tied with the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.220 
definitely want to be tied with the
direct<00:01:27.860> x<00:01:28.040> 10.1<00:01:28.670> instead<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.360> Eric<00:01:29.540> extent<00:01:29.960> i

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
direct x 10.1 instead of Eric extent i

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.870 
direct x 10.1 instead of Eric extent i
would<00:01:30.470> want<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.070> best<00:01:31.310> possible<00:01:31.580> so<00:01:32.530> i<00:01:33.700> go<00:01:34.700> for

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
would want the best possible so i go for

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.330 
would want the best possible so i go for
the<00:01:34.940> one<00:01:35.150> that<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.840> newer<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.830> would<00:01:37.070> support

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
the one that is newer that would support

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.540 
the one that is newer that would support
direct<00:01:37.640> x<00:01:37.900> 10.1<00:01:38.900> rather<00:01:39.500> than<00:01:39.620> 10<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:40.160> want<00:01:40.460> the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
direct x 10.1 rather than 10 I want the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.680 
direct x 10.1 rather than 10 I want the
better<00:01:40.700> resolution

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
better resolution

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.620 
better resolution
so<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.440> walked<00:01:43.830> into<00:01:43.980> a<00:01:44.100> store<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.400> saw<00:01:45.180> gave<00:01:45.450> up

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
so I walked into a store and saw gave up

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.010 
so I walked into a store and saw gave up
something<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> buy<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:47.090> use<00:01:48.090> DX<00:01:48.510> or<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.870> x

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
something to buy and use DX or the x

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.990 
something to buy and use DX or the x
10.1<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:50.640> probably<00:01:51.300> one<00:01:51.540> likely<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.410> DX

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
10.1 I'm probably one likely go for DX

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.180 
10.1 I'm probably one likely go for DX
10.1<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.270> graphics<00:01:54.660> card<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:55.050> do<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.630
