00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 j i this super fun i'm going to today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.609
 prime work and I've talked about it before 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.919
 and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.780
 or then I sit on a terrace with such glasses 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.960
 and tell a friend of nice sunglasses 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.260
 is the new one and then I just say yes 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.180
 after a not really new one I had 3 euros 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.400
 super chill at the prime market 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 they are therefore especially cheap 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 it because he usually actually buys yes 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 quite natural clothing and things we do 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.470
 expensive jeans 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.480
 And yes, I am very much into one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.340
 budget the cheaper you know what you 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.860
 always i'm really a big fan of it 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.280
 the prime mark and today we will go again 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.530
 yes because I have him so kind of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.210
 you haven't been over in any way 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.460
 In case he also goes to Primark 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.230
 super nice I was doubting which 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.710
 I went to Rotterdam then or 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.600
 Almere or Hoofddorp but yes maybe 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.629
 a high through it I have heard that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 in terms of yes, men's clothing is not quite there 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.850
 have a lot of nice things to rotterdam 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 is anyway a bit too far I think to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 just find a morning to go shopping 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.070
 it a little exaggerated to him 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.610
 to drive to Rotterdam 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.290
 So we go to the zaman yes that have 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.630
 of course you have shoes on top 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.540
 children but also a lot of gentlemen 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.979
 know what to think here and I go 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.509
 all of my purchases soon leave 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.729
 See you guys I hope he likes it 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.280

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.159
 yes matty mint green and that very whole 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.310

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.090
 4 euros so well how head 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.950
 I also had a shirt and it is on 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.850

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.079
 the back you have so yes it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.259
 is cut and yes I found that quite 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.700
 these slippers were always cool at 8 euros 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 useful for the summer 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.080
 last year i also gave one 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.050

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.490
 I am going on vacation to Spain and that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.600
 flip flops just really have a kind 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.270
 sustained 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.490
 so after him for those prices are fine 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.930

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.360

 what i also bought is that 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.070

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.769

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.239

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.030
 socks 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.190

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.290
 feet in front and at home 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.730

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.780
