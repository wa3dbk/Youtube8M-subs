is a new paradigm in computing basically
you<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.789> environment<00:00:21.750> by<00:00:21.840> which

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
you have this environment by which

people can gather around it's kind of a
tabletop<00:00:23.640> computing<00:00:24.180> environment<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
tabletop computing environment and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.900 
tabletop computing environment and
though<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.529> offers<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.130> technology<00:00:26.730> today

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
though it offers that technology today

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.000 
though it offers that technology today
in<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.420> tabletop<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.260> also<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> can

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
in a tabletop it can also be as you can

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.130 
in a tabletop it can also be as you can
really<00:00:29.429> see<00:00:29.760> easily<00:00:30.029> convert<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> into<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.840> full

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
really see easily convert it into a full

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.290 
really see easily convert it into a full
all-in-one<00:00:31.590> desktop<00:00:32.009> computer<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.489> well<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
all-in-one desktop computer as well so a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.700 
all-in-one desktop computer as well so a
person<00:00:33.480> who's<00:00:33.750> familiar<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> pc<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
person who's familiar with the pc and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.319 
person who's familiar with the pc and
the<00:00:35.070> windows<00:00:35.340> 8<00:00:35.489> environment<00:00:35.969> wants<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> do

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the windows 8 environment wants to do

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.990 
the windows 8 environment wants to do
say<00:00:37.140> their<00:00:37.320> normal<00:00:37.800> work<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.790> wants<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
say their normal work and then wants to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.130 
say their normal work and then wants to
gather<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> family<00:00:39.570> around<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.020> another

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
gather the family around in another

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600 
gather the family around in another
environment<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:41.219> bring<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.489> into

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
environment can actually bring them into

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.880 
environment can actually bring them into
this<00:00:41.760> tabletop<00:00:42.090> environment<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> begin

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
this tabletop environment and begin

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.840 
this tabletop environment and begin
playing<00:00:44.100> games<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.489> hopefully<00:00:44.640> you'll

wanted to focus in just on the element

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
wanted to focus in just on the element
of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> video<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.000> could<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> call<00:01:09.960> shake

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
of the video you could do it call shake

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
pictures and now it leaves everything

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.690 
pictures and now it leaves everything
that's<00:01:19.439> anything<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> photograph<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
that's anything it's a photograph so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
that's anything it's a photograph so
basically<00:01:21.390> when<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.540> merge<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
basically when you merge all that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.899 
basically when you merge all that
content<00:01:22.680> via<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.070> got<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.369> an<00:01:23.430> easy<00:01:23.610> way

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
content via they got to get an easy way

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.700
