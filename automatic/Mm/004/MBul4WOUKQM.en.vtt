00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
tremendous learning experience and you

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.830 
tremendous learning experience and you
can<00:03:49.560> sell<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.190> business<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:51.120> take<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
can sell the business and take the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.990 
can sell the business and take the
lessons<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.560> learned<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.280> move<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
lessons that you learned and move on to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.410 
lessons that you learned and move on to
another<00:03:54.410> opportunity<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.560> may<00:03:55.800> be<00:03:56.040> bigger

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
another opportunity that may be bigger

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.870 
another opportunity that may be bigger
bottom<00:03:57.420> line<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.230> can<00:03:58.440> never<00:03:58.890> sell<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.550> job

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
bottom line is you can never sell a job

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.960 
bottom line is you can never sell a job
so<00:04:00.750> basically<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.590> get<00:04:01.740> paid<00:04:01.980> twice<00:04:02.400> for

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
so basically you get paid twice for

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.750 
so basically you get paid twice for
working<00:04:03.330> once<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.800> exactly<00:04:05.340> what<00:04:05.580> I've

working once that is exactly what I've
done<00:04:06.030> for<00:04:06.090> more<00:04:06.570> than<00:04:06.750> 12<00:04:07.050> years<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:07.920> me

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
done for more than 12 years so to me

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.150 
done for more than 12 years so to me
it's<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.730> no-lose<00:04:09.210> situation<00:04:09.770> on<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.950> one

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
it's just a no-lose situation on the one

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.180 
it's just a no-lose situation on the one
side<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.880> can<00:04:12.060> guarantee<00:04:12.450> yourself<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.500> job
