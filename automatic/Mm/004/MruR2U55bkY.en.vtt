00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
playing if you only need that sequence

song well maybe you've resorted to

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.320 
song well maybe you've resorted to
muting<00:01:09.869> or<00:01:10.049> unmuting<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> mixer<00:01:11.010> channel<00:01:11.400> or

muting or unmuting the mixer channel or
maybe<00:01:12.600> you've<00:01:12.780> tried<00:01:12.960> automating<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> run

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
maybe you've tried automating the run

maybe you've tried automating the run
mode<00:01:14.130> parameter<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> repeat<00:01:16.040> while

mode parameter from off to repeat while

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
mode parameter from off to repeat while
both<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> those<00:01:17.460> methods<00:01:17.909> might<00:01:18.119> come<00:01:18.360> close

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
both of those methods might come close

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.020 
both of those methods might come close
to<00:01:18.810> achieving<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> desired<00:01:19.439> result<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
to achieving the desired result there is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600 
to achieving the desired result there is
a<00:01:21.060> better<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.950> let's<00:01:22.950> take<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.340> patch<00:01:23.580> for

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
a better way let's take this patch for

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.270 
a better way let's take this patch for
example<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.360> chose<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.439> patch<00:01:25.710> because<00:01:25.950> there

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
example I chose this patch because there

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.179 
example I chose this patch because there
are<00:01:26.369> two<00:01:26.549> things<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> control<00:01:27.600> here

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
are two things I want to control here

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.859 
are two things I want to control here
first<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.430> want<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.939> able<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.240> decide<00:01:30.570> when

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
first I want to be able to decide when

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
first I want to be able to decide when
the<00:01:31.020> sequence<00:01:31.290> starts<00:01:31.530> or<00:01:31.950> stops<00:01:31.979> playing<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the sequence starts or stops playing and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.030 
the sequence starts or stops playing and
second<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.810> want<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.350> able<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> play<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
second I want to be able to play the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
second I want to be able to play the
sequence<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:35.880> controller<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.930> it
