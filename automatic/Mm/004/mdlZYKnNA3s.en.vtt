okay<00:00:01.700> how<00:00:02.700> exactly<00:00:03.300> do<00:00:03.540> we<00:00:03.600> figure<00:00:03.870> out<00:00:03.990> our

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
okay how exactly do we figure out our

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.320 
okay how exactly do we figure out our
position<00:00:04.710> relative<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.759> vor

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
position relative to a vor

as<00:00:06.740> I<00:00:07.740> said<00:00:07.980> at<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.189> beginning<00:00:08.280> I'm<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.300> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
as I said at the beginning I'm going to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.530 
as I said at the beginning I'm going to
have<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.960> ask<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.800> forget<00:00:11.280> everything<00:00:12.210> you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
have to ask you to forget everything you

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.279 
have to ask you to forget everything you
know<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.740> are<00:00:14.929> trust<00:00:15.929> me

know about if you are trust me
this<00:00:16.980> system<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.210> much<00:00:18.600> simpler<00:00:19.080> than<00:00:19.289> what

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
this system is so much simpler than what

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.160 
this system is so much simpler than what
you're<00:00:19.680> used<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.100> think<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.869> needle

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
you're used to think about it the needle

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
you're used to think about it the needle
points<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.980> go<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.369> right

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
points to the right you go to the right

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.160 
points to the right you go to the right
and<00:00:23.939> you'll<00:00:24.090> go<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.420> left<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> the

and you'll go to the left you go to the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
nonsense how does a view our work it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.350 
nonsense how does a view our work it's
very<00:00:40.440> simple<00:00:40.920> let's<00:00:41.489> say<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.719> ask<00:00:43.530> you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
very simple let's say that I ask you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.959 
very simple let's say that I ask you
what<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:46.410> position<00:00:46.559> relative<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.399> me<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
what is your position relative to me and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.299 
what is your position relative to me and
let's<00:00:48.149> say<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.690> Texas<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:50.160> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
let's say I'm in Texas and you're in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.540 
let's say I'm in Texas and you're in
Maine<00:00:50.780> well<00:00:51.780> your<00:00:52.140> simplest<00:00:52.739> answer<00:00:53.160> would<00:00:53.520> be

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
Maine well your simplest answer would be

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.819 
Maine well your simplest answer would be
to<00:00:53.820> say<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.480> north<00:00:55.020> east<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.649> me

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
to say that you are north east of me

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.849 
to say that you are north east of me
well<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:57.149> exactly<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.920> vor<00:00:59.370> does<00:01:00.859> for

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
well that's exactly what a vor does for

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.560 
well that's exactly what a vor does for
example<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:03.390> vor<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.189> telling<00:01:05.189> me<00:01:05.450> that<00:01:06.450> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
example this vor is telling me that it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
example this vor is telling me that it
is<00:01:06.689> located<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.250> north<00:01:08.549> east<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:09.180> me<00:01:09.890> how

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
is located to the north east of me how

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
is located to the north east of me how
do<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.159> know<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.619> incredibly<00:01:13.619> simple<00:01:14.420> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
do I know it it's incredibly simple of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630 
do I know it it's incredibly simple of
you<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.650> before<00:01:16.860> giving<00:01:17.400> me<00:01:17.490> two

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you are like you before giving me two

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
you are like you before giving me two
cardinal<00:01:18.030> directions<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cardinal directions to get to you is

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399 
cardinal directions to get to you is
giving<00:01:20.369> me<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.750> couple<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.990> cardinal

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
giving me a couple of cardinal

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140 
giving me a couple of cardinal
directions<00:01:22.500> telling<00:01:23.280> me<00:01:23.549> where<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:23.970> located

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
directions telling me where it's located

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.399 
directions telling me where it's located
in<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.740> case<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:27.060> view<00:01:27.270> R<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.750> telling<00:01:28.259> me

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
in this case the view R is telling me

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
in this case the view R is telling me
that<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.430> north<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.420> east<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.680> me<00:01:31.860> how<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that it's north and east of me how do I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.230 
that it's north and east of me how do I
know<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.079> well<00:01:34.079> first<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:36.000> little

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
know this well first of all that little

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.990 
know this well first of all that little
-<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.810> flag<00:01:37.110> let's<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.310> call<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.729> flag

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
- from flag let's just call it a flag

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
- from flag let's just call it a flag
and<00:01:39.270> forget<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.680> -<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
and forget that there is a - from on it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.359 
and forget that there is a - from on it
it's<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.840> flag<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's just a flag it's one of the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
it's just a flag it's one of the
indicators<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.360> directs<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.200> towards<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
indicators that directs you towards the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.580 
indicators that directs you towards the
vor<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:48.329> case<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.409> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
vor in this case as you see it is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.090 
vor in this case as you see it is
pointing<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:51.720> look

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
pointing down so I look

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.660 
pointing down so I look
at<00:01:53.180> cardinal<00:01:54.180> direction<00:01:54.330> on<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> same<00:01:56.310> side

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
at cardinal direction on the same side

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.390 
at cardinal direction on the same side
that<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.300> flag<00:01:57.720> is<00:01:57.960> pointing<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.220> go

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
that that flag is pointing to if I go

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.730 
that that flag is pointing to if I go
straight<00:01:59.700> down<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.479> flag<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.560> see

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
straight down from that flag I can see

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.969 
straight down from that flag I can see
that<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.070> saying<00:02:02.310> hey<00:02:02.610> go<00:02:03.330> north<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.830> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that it's saying hey go north that is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.530 
that it's saying hey go north that is
one<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.430> two<00:02:05.580> cardinal<00:02:05.970> directions<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
one of the two cardinal directions that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.830 
one of the two cardinal directions that
we<00:02:06.690> must<00:02:06.930> use<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.770> go<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.310> station<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
we must use to go to that station the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.110 
we must use to go to that station the
second<00:02:10.320> cardinal<00:02:10.709> direction<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.370> shown<00:02:11.880> by

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
second cardinal direction is shown by

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.720 
second cardinal direction is shown by
the<00:02:12.180> needle<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.709> needle<00:02:13.740> will<00:02:14.070> swing<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.430> one

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the needle the needle will swing to one

the needle the needle will swing to one
side

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
side

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.380 
side
you<00:02:15.570> must<00:02:15.900> find<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.440> number<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.340> side<00:02:18.000> and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
you must find a number on that side and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.260 
you must find a number on that side and
in<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:18.990> case<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.470> evident<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.070> East<00:02:20.820> is

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
in this case it's evident that East is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.590 
in this case it's evident that East is
on<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.140> side<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.610> found<00:02:23.940> one<00:02:24.180> cardinal

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
on that side so I found one cardinal

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.479 
on that side so I found one cardinal

one<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.030> needle<00:02:27.300> east<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:28.590> vor<00:02:29.100> is

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
one for the needle east this vor is

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.690 
one for the needle east this vor is
telling<00:02:29.880> me<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.239> north<00:02:31.020> east<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.920> me<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
telling me it's north east of me it is

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.600 
telling me it's north east of me it is
that<00:02:33.270> simple

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
that simple

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.650 
that simple

now I'm going to give you another
thorough<00:02:37.170> explanation<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.280> how<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.670> use<00:02:38.880> this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
thorough explanation on how we use this

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.870 
thorough explanation on how we use this
method<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.050> everything<00:02:40.590> gets<00:02:40.770> clear<00:02:41.190> remember

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
method so everything gets clear remember

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.570 
method so everything gets clear remember
you<00:02:42.120> need<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.540> forget<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.580> first

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
you need to forget what you know first

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.360 
you need to forget what you know first
of<00:02:44.730> all<00:02:44.820> do<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.630> see<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.080> -<00:02:46.290> from<00:02:46.560> flag<00:02:46.860> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
of all do you see that - from flag you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.040 
of all do you see that - from flag you
know<00:02:47.400> do<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.700> see<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.300> -<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> from

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
know do you see the the - and the from

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.890 
know do you see the the - and the from
on<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.350> instrument<00:02:49.890> no<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.459> don't<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.600> to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
on that instrument no you don't that to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.680 
on that instrument no you don't that to
and<00:02:52.050> from<00:02:52.260> does<00:02:52.650> not<00:02:52.920> exist<00:02:53.640> okay<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and from does not exist okay that's the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.150 
and from does not exist okay that's the
first<00:02:54.720> step<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.260> need<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.500> do<00:02:55.650> realize<00:02:56.100> that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
first step you need to do realize that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.900 
first step you need to do realize that
there<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.550> no<00:02:56.790> -<00:02:57.030> from<00:02:57.500> second<00:02:58.519> we<00:02:59.519> look<00:02:59.760> at

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
there is no - from second we look at

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.590 
there is no - from second we look at
what<00:03:00.510> side<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.350> flag<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.890> pointing<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.519> as<00:03:02.700> you

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
what side the flag is pointing to as you

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.220 
what side the flag is pointing to as you
see<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.530> flag<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:05.040> pointing<00:03:05.489> straight<00:03:05.519> up

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
see the flag is pointing straight up

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.110 
see the flag is pointing straight up
this<00:03:07.230> pretty<00:03:07.500> much<00:03:07.709> means<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.730> cardinal

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
this pretty much means that the cardinal

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.180 
this pretty much means that the cardinal
direction<00:03:09.299> it's<00:03:09.810> pointing<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.410> will<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:11.040> on

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
direction it's pointing to will be on

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.430 
direction it's pointing to will be on
the<00:03:11.280> top<00:03:11.549> side<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.150> instrument<00:03:12.660> the

the top side of the instrument the
bottom<00:03:13.860> 180<00:03:14.700> degree<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.239> instrument<00:03:15.720> you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
bottom 180 degree of the instrument you

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.069 
bottom 180 degree of the instrument you
can<00:03:16.380> pretty<00:03:16.590> much<00:03:16.680> black<00:03:17.370> out<00:03:17.840> because<00:03:18.840> our

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
can pretty much black out because our

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.930 
can pretty much black out because our
carnal<00:03:19.410> direction<00:03:19.829> cannot<00:03:20.160> belong<00:03:20.610> in<00:03:20.850> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
carnal direction cannot belong in the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.320 
carnal direction cannot belong in the

bottom side of the instrument

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.070 
bottom side of the instrument
now<00:03:25.290> straight<00:03:25.800> from<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> top<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:27.480> look<00:03:27.690> for

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
now straight from the top if we look for

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.990 
now straight from the top if we look for
a<00:03:28.110> cardinal<00:03:28.530> direction<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.340> closest

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
a cardinal direction the closest

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.910 
a cardinal direction the closest

going<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.810> look<00:03:55.020> at<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> needle<00:03:55.850> okay<00:03:56.880> now

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
going to look at the needle okay now

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.210 
going to look at the needle okay now
we're<00:03:57.630> looking<00:03:57.720> at<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.110> needle<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.590> the

we're looking for cannot be on that side
there<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:10.950> that's<00:04:11.250> why<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:11.580> gone<00:04:11.850> the

there and that's why it's gone the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.510 
there and that's why it's gone the
cardinal<00:04:13.200> direction<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.830> on<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.220> left<00:04:14.430> side

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
cardinal direction is on the left side

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.820 
cardinal direction is on the left side
if<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.270> go<00:04:15.450> straight<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.140> middle<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
if I go straight to the middle of that

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.340 
if I go straight to the middle of that
and<00:04:17.070> find<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.239> closest<00:04:18.810> cardinal<00:04:19.200> direction

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
and find the closest cardinal direction

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.840 
and find the closest cardinal direction
to<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.010> middle<00:04:20.340> as<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:21.120> see<00:04:21.650> East<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:23.040> on<00:04:23.520> that

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
to the middle as you see East is on that

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.140 
to the middle as you see East is on that
side<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:24.480> we<00:04:25.410> want<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.770> fly<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.340> station<00:04:26.850> we

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
side if we want to fly to the station we

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.870 
side if we want to fly to the station we
need<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.450> fly<00:04:27.660> south<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.650> east

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
need to fly south and east

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.160 
need to fly south and east
putting<00:04:30.510> us<00:04:30.630> north<00:04:31.290> west<00:04:31.890> of<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.669> station

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.980 

okay<00:04:36.170> let's<00:04:36.770> look<00:04:37.070> at<00:04:37.280> for<00:04:38.120> example<00:04:38.150> question

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
okay let's look at for example question

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.830 
okay let's look at for example question
to<00:04:39.380> see<00:04:39.620> how<00:04:40.040> this<00:04:40.610> method<00:04:40.910> actually<00:04:41.450> helps<00:04:41.720> us

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
to see how this method actually helps us

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.910 
to see how this method actually helps us
let's<00:04:42.710> say<00:04:42.830> given<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.820> following<00:04:44.420> vor<00:04:45.080> you're

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
let's say given the following vor you're

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.340 
let's say given the following vor you're
asked<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.580> identify<00:04:46.670> what<00:04:47.390> your<00:04:47.420> position<00:04:47.780> is

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
asked to identify what your position is

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.590 
asked to identify what your position is
and<00:04:49.330> possible<00:04:50.330> answers<00:04:50.870> are<00:04:51.640> 812<00:04:52.640> or<00:04:52.970> two<00:04:54.580> okay

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
and possible answers are 812 or two okay

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.630 
and possible answers are 812 or two okay
again<00:04:56.600> I'm<00:04:57.200> going<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.740> look<00:04:57.860> at<00:04:58.040> my<00:04:58.190> view<00:04:58.430> are

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
again I'm going to look at my view are

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.970 
again I'm going to look at my view are
as<00:04:58.990> we<00:04:59.990> see<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:01.220> flag<00:05:01.690> points<00:05:02.690> towards<00:05:03.470> the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
as we see the flag points towards the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.970 
as we see the flag points towards the
self<00:05:04.930> meaning<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:06.050> must<00:05:06.290> be<00:05:06.410> nor<00:05:06.710> for<00:05:06.950> the

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
self meaning I must be nor for the

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.870 
self meaning I must be nor for the
station<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.780> needle<00:05:09.260> points<00:05:10.130> towards

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
station and the needle points towards

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.920 
station and the needle points towards
the<00:05:11.030> west

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
the west

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.820 
the west
so<00:05:12.830> I'm<00:05:12.980> east<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.490> station<00:05:14.200> so<00:05:15.200> for<00:05:15.560> me<00:05:15.680> to

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
so I'm east of the station so for me to

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.730 
so I'm east of the station so for me to
fly<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:16.580> station<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:17.360> would<00:05:18.230> have<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.530> fly

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
fly to this station I would have to fly

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.880 
fly to this station I would have to fly
south<00:05:19.520> west<00:05:20.480> oh<00:05:21.730> well<00:05:22.730> then<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:23.690> have<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.530> be

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
south west oh well then I have to be

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.840 
south west oh well then I have to be
north<00:05:25.250> east<00:05:25.640> of<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.000> station<00:05:27.340> if<00:05:28.340> I<00:05:28.520> have<00:05:28.670> to

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
north east of the station if I have to

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.400 
north east of the station if I have to
be<00:05:28.970> northeast<00:05:29.390> of<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.720> station<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.200> I<00:05:30.260> look

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
be northeast of the station and I look

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.010 
be northeast of the station and I look
at<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.590> three<00:05:30.830> answers<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:32.090> only<00:05:32.510> answer

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
at the three answers the only answer

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.390 
at the three answers the only answer
that<00:05:33.050> matches<00:05:33.650> is<00:05:33.830> answer<00:05:34.520> number<00:05:34.970> eight
