00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 today I did not manage in 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.350
 Do not do anything to gettorf 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.940
 but maybe there is still a good place 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.460
 Take turns today to come 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.680
 Just show me my outfit 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.600
 as I dressed myself as so 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180
 I tried a bit more if 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 I really only antisocial at it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.040
 yes it is really so I enter you 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.910
 little makeup is the shit and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.480
 loose clothes and there are 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.129
 once this chelseas if I have it 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 Attract received things and think the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 Be the coolest with yours 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.329
 popping and sitting up 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 purse and so what is there 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.270
 I have different now 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.329
 the first variant decided and so 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.280
 Hold out while my make up exists 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.890
 from a blue eyeshadow 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.219
 little green under your eyes 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.629
 then I had a pink karl pink 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.519
 lipstick is a bit smeared 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.780
 So I have the next here to the side 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 pulled is now from the lips 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 I just believe so I have one 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.409
 bit by root and stop in that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.240
 pigtail clearly pulled up 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.240
 Of course, then I have the whole day 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 worn as the headphones today 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.869
 I had this on here from that of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.110
 my friend a bit easy 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.320
 Eti is a very old if you that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.490
 Italy still knows and yes I'll get you 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.259
 now down and that is now 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.420
 the bottom sight of it i hope you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.770
 you see everything and that's because I as 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.070
 first with me to hang out 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.110
 can 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.939
 this is a normal sports bag 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.759
 are also from my friend cloud 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.740
 who then gives up her mind already 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.360
 a little older and yes have to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 Of course I still have a pair of sweatpants 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.479
 I had no adidas water 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.479
 Where else is that? 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.090
 I got one while 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.400
 let down and exhausted from two 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.830
 different socks to your own thing 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.739
 when folding down I have over the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.800
 Theory pants pulled and that is one 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.410
 turtles made how cool it would be 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.650
 to Michael Fincke badelatschen to 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.930
 so had both partners because yes 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.110
 hipster is and therefore socks in 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.239
 Swaddling around and yes that was 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.590
 I put it from the bottom too 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.150
 me up again and I show what I am 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.030
 have used for my make-up 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.630
 I had my make-up with regional p2 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.790
 cosmetics right and that I had 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.209
 once as in pankow shed this 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.459
 here 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.650
 that's the great lesch of maybelline 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.840
 jade, I took care of myself 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.340
 to make up the eyelashes more below 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.900
 as above because I find one 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.450
 a little bit ahead and somehow 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.970
 just as a film blurred is also a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.260
 bit for me my face i have 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.049
 Just a little bit with powder 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.430
 April april powder and stop 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.680
 pressed a bit on it 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.890
 Ambush looks like it has darkened 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:13.170
 which did not fall down for the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.940
 I have hip from this point 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.730
 I have used exactly once 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.070
 Unfortunately, yakuza orders a total flop 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.630
 for me so I have both of me 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.230
 ordered both because I thought who 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.390
 well this totally bad in my opinion 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.579
 suggesting something is used because 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.660
 are just two blurred and the 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:36.150
 color just looks so sloppy 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.019
 just does not look like me 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.859
 that may say so 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.690
 that's the color and with ten pinky and 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.829
 that's why he's perfect for that now 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.540
 I also fit a bit 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.680
 blurred still extra is with the time 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.049
 also a bit around myself 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.650
 You can shove it everywhere 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.720
 throw away fit for today quite well 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.540
 then i had eyes on b2 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.280
 this eyeshadow in color 19 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.080
 bed guilty of ultras etiquette and 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.870
 primer that is 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.800
 really important bright blue what up 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.860
 it goes from the bang I was so 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.110
 normally you have to go blind 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.780
 and then I had to go under the 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:26.010
 look at this one from b2d 20 green chrome 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.020
 shadow as easy already quite easy 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.160
 green so only set youth work 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.260
 in the eye is not really 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.080
 then nice now completely from this 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.760
 blue of course not and that was it 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.630
 even from my make up that was it 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.960
 with this look and tomorrow comes the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.960
 next
