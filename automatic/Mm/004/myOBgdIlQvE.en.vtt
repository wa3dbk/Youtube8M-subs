more<00:00:28.650> clearly<00:00:29.119> go<00:00:30.119> ahead<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.480> run<00:00:30.599> into<00:00:30.869> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
more clearly go ahead and run into it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.799 
more clearly go ahead and run into it
here<00:00:31.140> show<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.940> inner<00:00:33.329> workings<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
here show you the inner workings of the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810 
here show you the inner workings of the
pump<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> volume<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.399> air<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
pump and the volume of air that is

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.360 
pump and the volume of air that is
produced<00:00:36.239> by<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.450> pump<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.129> go<00:00:38.129> ahead<00:00:38.190> check

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
produced by this pump so go ahead check

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.350 
produced by this pump so go ahead check
it<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:39.170> go<00:00:40.170> ahead<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> open<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.010> up

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
it out here go ahead and open this up

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
it out here go ahead and open this up
look<00:00:42.360> inside<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.260> 2<00:00:43.440> D<00:00:43.620> batteries<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
look inside the 2 D batteries which it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.860 
look inside the 2 D batteries which it
runs<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.809> in<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.140> center<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
runs on in the center here you have a

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.540 
runs on in the center here you have a
this<00:00:48.870> section<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> business<00:00:50.370> motor

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this section here is the business motor

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.290 
this section here is the business motor
on<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> end<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> rotor<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
on the end of the rotor there is a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.080 
on the end of the rotor there is a
little<00:00:54.719> offset<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.860> motor<00:00:56.070> rotates<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
little offset so as the motor rotates it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.299 
little offset so as the motor rotates it
pulls<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.289> back<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.770> forth<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.039> an

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
pulls this back and forth like an

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.540 
pulls this back and forth like an
oscillation<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.570> causes<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.550> bladder

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
oscillation and it causes the bladder

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.200 
oscillation and it causes the bladder
here<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.710> take<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.890> air<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> push<00:01:05.519> air<00:01:05.729> through

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
here to take in air and push air through

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.010 
here to take in air and push air through
the<00:01:06.600> airline<00:01:06.930> tubing<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:08.070> into<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> tank<00:01:09.020> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the airline tubing down into the tank so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.120 
the airline tubing down into the tank so
we'll<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.200> ahead<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> close<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.950> real

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
we'll go ahead and close this up real

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.440 
we'll go ahead and close this up real
quick<00:01:12.110> fire<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.290> up

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.710 

let<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> check<00:01:16.260> out<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.270> bubbles<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> makes

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
let you check out the bubbles that makes

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.899 
let you check out the bubbles that makes
I<00:01:19.280> mean<00:01:20.280> check<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.550> out<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:23.400> such<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I mean check that out that is such a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.810 
I mean check that out that is such a
large<00:01:24.330> volume<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.050> air<00:01:25.740> being<00:01:26.130> pushed<00:01:26.520> through

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
large volume of air being pushed through

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.680 
large volume of air being pushed through
this<00:01:27.500> pump<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> mean<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:30.420> pretty<00:01:30.570> much

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
this pump I mean it's pretty much

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.100 
this pump I mean it's pretty much
amazing<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.260> me<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:32.660> amount<00:01:33.660> of<00:01:33.780> air<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
amazing to me the amount of air that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
amazing to me the amount of air that
you're<00:01:34.259> getting<00:01:34.440> pushed<00:01:35.070> into<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> tank<00:01:35.580> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you're getting pushed into the tank I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.140 
you're getting pushed into the tank I
mean<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.660> look<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
mean you can look here you can see the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.010 
mean you can look here you can see the
bubbles<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:40.040> splashing<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.720> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> top

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
bubbles just splashing up on the top

bubbles just splashing up on the top
here<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.580> get<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:44.820> look<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.450> surface

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
here you get a good look for the surface

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920 
here you get a good look for the surface
agitation<00:01:46.440> that's<00:01:46.590> occurring<00:01:46.950> from<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.340

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
I mean with that amount of bubbles

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.740 
I mean with that amount of bubbles
coming<00:01:53.350> into<00:01:53.470> here<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:55.620> popping<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:57.750> you're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
coming into here and popping and you're

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.330

gonna<00:01:58.870> have<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.050> good<00:01:59.200> gas<00:01:59.470> exchange<00:01:59.800> and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
gonna have a good gas exchange and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.210 
gonna have a good gas exchange and
you're<00:02:00.850> certainly<00:02:01.330> going<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.660> be<00:02:01.979> having<00:02:02.979> a

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.120 
you're certainly going to be having a
decent<00:02:03.640> amount<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.180> oxygenation<00:02:05.130> occurring

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
decent amount of oxygenation occurring

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.870 
decent amount of oxygenation occurring
in<00:02:06.220> your<00:02:06.340> tank<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.410> hope<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:08.800> answered<00:02:09.459> the
