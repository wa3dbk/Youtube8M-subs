00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.700
 in one of the videos I was asked this 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.580
 the question is why I have a smokehouse 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.330
 It looks like a new one. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.910
 cylindrical here it's smokehouse in 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 the author of the question they say after 1 or 2 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.900
 smoked times it has become rusty 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 stained friends the fact is that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.560
 cylindrical smokehouse here it is she 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.140
 I am also covered with rust stains 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.090
 it is made of carbon steel and 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.480
 don't go anywhere from it carbon 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.610
 steel 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
 she is naturally exposed 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.260
 corrosion so these specks they 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.590
 of course they will appear outside 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.059
 smokehouse and inside smokehouse as with this 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 fight I have videos 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.840
 told me how I look after my 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.980
 cylindrical smoke not me 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.410
 I wipe it from the inside with an always dry newspaper 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.160
 before you start smoking and after 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.860
 smoking 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.590
 so well, my hand is a stainless pallet 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.289
 here is a drip pan here 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.960
 i see him never even mine 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.129
 just wipe it here already 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.850
 natural anti-corrosion coating 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.500
 as if there is soot so here, too, with 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 This side of course also has 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.360
 Here's a definitely like 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.220
 rust spots well there is nothing 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.229
 done you just need to live with it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 well through it to the active course not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.799
 will burn the point is that here 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.630
 Steel 0.8 millimeter and you need so much 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.579
 time that fry or in such 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.130
 conditions and and keep from me she just 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.170
 the garage is kept therefore 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.060
 nothing happens to her in general but 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 she looks that way 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.259
 As for the asbestos cord, well 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.409
 of course you need to change it periodically 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.390
 because otherwise he starts to miss 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.270
 but even the point is that the new cord 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.220
 he also skips a little bit but when we 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.740
 fry meat and fish in our apartment too 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.240
 it smells like food so if we smoke in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.350
 apartment here to say so less 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.299
 there was smell only two options 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.520
 first less chips 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.790
 I put two canteens on this picture 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 spoon this time the second smoke is ready 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.350
 salted product ie fish or 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.050
 the fat is already completely salim 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.630
 and smoke here such a way as I in 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.150
 many rollers showed semi hot and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.140
 one more option i practically 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.450
 most 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.350
 meat products meat be pork 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.720
 beef there 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.180
 but any meat when I'm smoked I 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.820
 always his business smoked cooked that is 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.820
 what is the minimum so to say in 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.560
 smokehouse here but the minimum time she 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.660
 standing on my stove to have less 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.180
 smell and then bring the product to 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.130
 availability already in the process of cooking Well 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.800
 that's what you can do at home 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.200
 if of course try to smoke dry 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.350
 on raw product in smokehouse especially 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.370
 meat but the house will of course just not 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.370
 breathe from them
