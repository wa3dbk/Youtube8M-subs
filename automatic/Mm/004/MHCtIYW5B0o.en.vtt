class is made from using my sandy

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.130 
class is made from using my sandy
ravaged<00:02:20.940> classy<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.240> was<00:02:22.480> trying<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.780> get<00:02:22.990> on

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
ravaged classy I was trying to get on

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.170 
ravaged classy I was trying to get on
this<00:02:23.980> game<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> wasn't<00:02:24.670> going<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:24.880> sandy

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
this game I wasn't going for sandy

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.760 
this game I wasn't going for sandy
ravaged<00:02:25.480> cups<00:02:25.690> but<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> end<00:02:25.990> up<00:02:26.050> doing<00:02:26.110> amazing

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
ravaged cups but I end up doing amazing

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.600 
ravaged cups but I end up doing amazing
so<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.010> thought<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.310> was<00:02:27.400> worth<00:02:27.550> putting<00:02:27.820> up<00:02:28.470> so

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
so I thought it was worth putting up so

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.850 
so I thought it was worth putting up so
right<00:02:30.610> here<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:30.850> catch<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.180> few<00:02:31.390> kills<00:02:31.860> that's

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
right here I catch a few kills that's

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.390 
right here I catch a few kills that's
him<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:34.600> him<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.959> right<00:02:35.860> about<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.340> I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
him that's him and right about here I

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.030 
him that's him and right about here I
get<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> sky<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.930> think<00:02:38.140> status<00:02:38.620> was<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.890> bit

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
get the sky and I think status was a bit

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.250 
get the sky and I think status was a bit
overpowered<00:02:39.610> by<00:02:39.760> tom<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.390> don't<00:02:40.959> want<00:02:41.110> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
overpowered by tom I don't want the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.350 
overpowered by tom I don't want the
flamers<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.860> get<00:02:41.980> me<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.000> gun<00:02:43.180> is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
flamers to get me so on the gun is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.490 
flamers to get me so on the gun is
powerful<00:02:44.110> not<00:02:44.560> overpowered<00:02:45.310> it's<00:02:45.730> powerful

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
powerful not overpowered it's powerful

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.140 
powerful not overpowered it's powerful
so<00:02:47.500> i<00:02:47.980> think<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.370> pretty<00:02:48.489> insane<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:49.090> you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
so i think is pretty insane that you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.380 
so i think is pretty insane that you
unlock<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.420> level<00:02:49.870> 1<00:02:50.020> into<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.739> vol<00:02:50.950> class

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
unlock this level 1 into the vol class

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.970 
unlock this level 1 into the vol class

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
it's pretty stupid in my opinion but uh

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.400 
it's pretty stupid in my opinion but uh

of<00:04:00.790> harriers<00:04:01.150> for<00:04:01.660> this<00:04:01.870> is<00:04:01.930> my<00:04:02.019> fourth<00:04:02.260> let's

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
of harriers for this is my fourth let's

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.349

and<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.710> thought<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:06.980> would<00:04:07.070> be<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.190> frickin

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
and I thought it would be a frickin

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.490 
and I thought it would be a frickin
intense<00:04:07.790> game<00:04:08.240> to<00:04:08.390> put<00:04:08.540> up<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.990> of<00:04:09.290> course

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
intense game to put up and of course

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.590 
intense game to put up and of course
