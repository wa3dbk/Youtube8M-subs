00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:11.379
 Yes, let's study how to find the coordinates of the triangle's center of gravity here 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:15.280
 Let's re-confirmed that the once again I mean Tsu Na is not the center of gravity of the triangle it before the 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:20.110
 The center of gravity of the triangle is the lottery store 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.470
 Layers of Tteyuu lottery but the viewpoint from where the lottery is such and Nentteyuu this 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.900
 For example, a town store 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 Please take a look from vertex a to this a very bc of this 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.970
 Imperial Court bc 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.070
 Toward the sky 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.239
 A line drawn from a This is a lottery , and look at the top b 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 Middle point of 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.230
 This line drawn towards here is lottery 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:53.760
 Similar to c's very ab midpoint 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.829
 Heat for this battle This is a lot of drawing It is such an intersection of the middle line intersect at one point and this is the center of gravity 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.480
 It was something to say 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:07.780
 As you already know the big feature of the center of gravity that this was the center of gravity 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.060
 When the minute is not important to the important element here I'm goin to minute not here to painful position 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.310
 This was the feature of the center of gravity 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.820
 Of such a center of gravity rather than the feature of such an emphasis that was to learn the important things here 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.320
 How to find coordinates 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.330
 Hmm 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.780
 How to ask 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.640
 Also say the conclusion is I'm learning the Tteyuu 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.300
 Each x coordinate doing the 3-point abc such Fu x- xx 3 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:39.250
 In the case of contamination, take 1 sheet at a time and 3 each 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:46.340
 The 33.3 of 10 rookie of kbc coordinates when 3 minutes of x stand of xx door-thirds of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:50.780
 By stopping at the y-coordinate of doubling the birch, Yuko's formula is important 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:55.850
 Not to be is the image at 3 d abc There are to the x- is x is either deliberately 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.579
 If similarly b of the x has 5 c say that extensin celebration to result individual coordinates 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.250
 Nishi Ward 3 which is 3 minutes x 1 + x 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.179
 And but taken by stops even y 3 is but I was x-coordinate emergency people that put out at 1 + is of 3 minutes 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.330
 I mean that 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:13.700
 what is vfc 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:16.790
 What also Ness who I thought but I think that also stops seeking Ya seen in yourself first this 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 You can find the midpoint of bc 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 And further the center of gravity when the own b and half coordinate guy at the midpoint of the c obtained 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.530
 I know I'm not in the right position here 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.220
 8 If you like this store that does not divide your brother Daiichi know this is what you can find So Ma Am Shipwreck 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.370
 But let's see 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.020
 I think that it is easy to remember the coordinates of the center of gravity 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.710
 It is good if O'remember so silly when 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:49.850
 Oh , let's see it so that you can practice it specifically 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:51.830
 To the 3-point -1-3 b 12 the number of vertices's a c 6-1 is Toko the occasion of the 10 rookie of the security 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.720
 I already understand the currency management 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.040
 The third in the third of xi -x x coordinate -1 + 1 + 6 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.469
 Now the x coordinates are organized by the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:11.370
 Similarly, it looks like itamine-1 to look for minus with the 3rd y coordinate and y coordinate combination . 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:14.459
 That from Te calculated -2/3 Do this is the center of gravity of the sheath answer is that I know that 2 of 3-3 minutes 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.030
 So you are anxious person without a head 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:24.220
 I'm going out like this in another xy plane day like this 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:29.830
 Since There deficiencies When you arbitrarily placed and this area from a single sheath Marinos 12 do Ya 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:35.490
 x coordinate - 1 here than is the ask y coordinate ignorance of also the upper cat sides are 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:40.590
 In c 6-1 that minus 1 A or more this side is that twice Maeda of 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:45.720
 You can see where it is the center of gravity by taking about 9 weeks 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:51.150
 It Nde You can save considerably time just write a simple figure to such wind 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:55.450
 There are often times when there is not much time but there is too much base xy plane meeting 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:59.319
 By Toka that center test and I think I even such simple diagram 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:04.030
 It is how to find the coordinates of these ten newcomers that are important here 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.800
 3 minutes of the x's of xe 9 agents also stopped at 3 minutes of the y-coordinate y-coordinate y-coordinate 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.760
 Please confirm that 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.760
 After that, let's find a strike and practice it yourself so that it can be used as a hint already
