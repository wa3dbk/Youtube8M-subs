00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.200
 cooking duck 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:17.190
 I once looked for a cooking recipe 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.840
 ducks and now all a lot 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 information on the Internet 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 well and also not easy to figure out 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.320
 the film will recipe delicious and find 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.910
 really what i need 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 I was looking for a very long time and I needed 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.770
 The recipe is that here I will cook duck juice and he 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.170
 very very tasty juicy 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.960
 it needs to be added just 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.149
 some sort of sauce 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.860
 my husband is such a recipe from whom and as a result 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.290
 I had a recipe how to cook a duck in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.050
 one of the restaurants 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.120
 and I will tell you today very much 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.110
 just don't take a duck and divide it by 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.520
 four pieces 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 first we divide the semi ridge into two 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.420
 parts and then each part in half then 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.750
 we have 2 parts with a wing and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.940
 two parts with the legs I have not 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.540
 fixed 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.800
 this blow thought so clear 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.950
 giblets we leave and if they are 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.450
 we do not need them in this people 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.490
 I do not recommend thinking anyway 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.080
 throw out great ones 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.410
 the sauce 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.140
 and how I make a great sauce is it not 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.570
 I'll tell you in another recipe 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 reception and Julia Child's there just 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.680
 used under grass 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.610
 but more on that later now back to our 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.450
 juicy ass 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.200
 so we have four pieces of duck and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.480
 start we need with you and and fry 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.850
 heated a frying pan 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.280
 put the duck parts 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.490
 skin down in fact the oil can not 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.140
 add if you doubt your 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.790
 pan that there is instantly all 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.190
 will stick and I skin will stick 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.470
 you can but lightly smear it because 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.739
 duck she is very fat and and very good 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.500
 fat is released and we put it on 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.670
 skin so just that john went right away 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.890
 same and when with not burned roasted 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.640
 very quickly and we generally fry here 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.640
 so here are the two sides all parts i fire 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.689
 are specified with the two parts 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.930
 until golden brown crust it turns out this 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:43.000
 do you want to eat the beautiful one 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.550
 now we need parts we fry them we 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.230
 sprinkled with salt 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.240
 you can still pepper left now 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 we cut apple here we take 1 big 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.760
 an apple we cut it only like this 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.040
 cut the onion into half rings and where 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:11.740
 we have roasted and ducks we put there 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:18.160
 at the bottom of the apples and the top we lay out 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:23.560
 our pieces are already full and water 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.660
 so that the duck sticks out slightly but the water 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.380
 This stage can be further it podsolit 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.380
 water itself 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.940
 some other spices in principle not 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.310
 required that is if you have 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 desire can put a bay leaf and 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.880
 and generally some bouquet of herbs that you 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.580
 like basically this 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.330
 confine 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:52.170
 in general, we cover everything and 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:57.210
 slow fire it all stew somewhere 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:00.120
 an hour and a half depending on 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.300
 the boat itself for it to reach 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.870
 softness with the principle after this 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.590
 term duck ready to eat fell in 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.790
 world but here in that restaurant up from 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.660
 whose recipe I have 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.660
 there they still put in the oven 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:26.430
 up getting ready with or already this one again 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.590
 it is difficult to make a crust 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.670
 put under the grill in principle if not 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.860
 afraid there is a lot to follow right if 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.940
 quickly want to make a chicken yes or 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.139
 there for five minutes then beautiful us 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.879
 coloring 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.219
 turned out all I serve flour as you 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.949
 like with any suns with any 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:54.590
 garnish as your heart desires that is 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.590
 this is such a wonderful 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.650
 basic recipe in principle even 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.720
 resources rubs what it turns out 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:08.500
 very juicy, that's just vanilla 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.540
 so I recommend you not so let's say not 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.260
 throw away what remains on 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.820
 from fatty meat, that is, if 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:22.180
 you cook lamb here duck there goose yes 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.720
 after that there is a lot of this 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.440
 here's how to become a broth no broth until here 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.170
 This juice base is recommended and below is not 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.810
 throw an ass out of the pan 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.720
 skillet and on this basis it turns out 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.330
 just gorgeous sauces so recommend 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.080
