 what it contains we do 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.750
 we play a lot with each other 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.650
 Romeo 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.170
 we use the amaranth and have saved 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.540
 pumpkin seed had face 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.060
 sunflower as dry groups 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.510
 the pistachio burger sticks out 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.219
 its originality and flavor are a meat 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.819
 also fully covered with pistachio 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:14.200

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:20.050
 of meat the products within the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.430
 apple celery was null 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.430
 he also does not know that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.660
 guadalajara an option is the 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.450
 central burger joint where each 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.080
 Saucer is personalized and passion 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.700
 with go the for me the best of those that 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.010
 we have is the one I love the most 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.110
 maybe maybe the best one is the gourmet 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.510
 but to which I recommend is that 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.100
 because to prove what it is that 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.830
 are we taste our bread 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.560
 our flesh manipulate us because that already 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.450
 you prepare it to your liking or you can 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.790
 go to the boquería where they trust in their 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.890
 food and its customers who decide the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.870
 price than they consume our 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.420
 men this is a the line except the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.610
 of shrimp and salmon and beef 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.920
 then if a veal and we have 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.360
 lamb we have the shrimp with salmon 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.090

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.860
