a<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.500> nervous<00:01:22.710> how<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> think

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a little bit nervous how do you think

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.820 
a little bit nervous how do you think
your<00:01:23.520> play<00:01:23.729> style<00:01:23.970> fits<00:01:24.240> within<00:01:24.450> rocket<00:01:24.930> well

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
your play style fits within rocket well

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
your play style fits within rocket well
I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.549> golly<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.630> consistently

I think I golly need is consistently

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
I think I golly need is consistently
because<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.369> place<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.030> really

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
because the other place is really really

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.620 
because the other place is really really
good<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.290> need<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> farm<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> do

good<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> final<00:01:38.640> question<00:01:38.759> maybe<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.329> rocket

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
good a final question maybe about rocket

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.420 
good a final question maybe about rocket
in<00:01:39.780> general<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.560> come<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> new

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
in general you come in there as a new

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.649 
in general you come in there as a new
force<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.880> there's<00:01:42.030> been<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> talk

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
force and there's been a lot of talk

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.090 
force and there's been a lot of talk
from<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:43.020> players<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.530> well<00:01:43.560> they're<00:01:43.860> so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
from other players as well they're so

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
from other players as well they're so
good<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.399> scrims<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.210> translating

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
good in scrims but it's not translating

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
good in scrims but it's not translating
did<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.649> notice<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.430> when<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.880> came

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
did you notice that at all when you came

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.580 
did you notice that at all when you came
into<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> team<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> notice<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.290> big

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
into the team you notice that big

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.170 
into the team you notice that big
difference<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.189> maybe<00:01:50.369> why<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.640> didn't

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
difference and maybe why it didn't

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.600 
difference and maybe why it didn't
translate<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> stage<00:01:52.020> until<00:01:52.470> now<00:01:52.649> well<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
translate to the stage until now well I

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.069 
translate to the stage until now well I
definitely<00:01:53.850> realized<00:01:54.329> why<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.930> saying

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
definitely realized why I one is saying

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.420 
definitely realized why I one is saying
rocket<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.560> good<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:55.799> screams<00:01:56.009> because

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
rocket is so good at screams because

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.170 
rocket is so good at screams because
yeah<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.390> beats<00:01:57.600> most<00:01:57.990> teams<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.820> yeah<00:02:00.149> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
yeah we beats most teams but yeah I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.670 
yeah we beats most teams but yeah I
think<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.540> biggest<00:02:00.630> problem<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
think the biggest problem is that in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.410 
think the biggest problem is that in
scrims<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.520> loved-up<00:02:02.670> easy<00:02:02.880> kills<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
scrims we get loved-up easy kills and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
scrims we get loved-up easy kills and
when<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.049> come<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.439> stage<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.860> won't

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
when we come on to the stage we won't

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.160 
when we come on to the stage we won't
get<00:02:05.159> those<00:02:05.340> easy<00:02:05.549> kills<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.659> we

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
get those easy kills and then we

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.190 
get those easy kills and then we
sometimes<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.000> in<00:02:09.000> scrims<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.690> fight

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
sometimes and in scrims we just fight

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.449 
sometimes and in scrims we just fight
for<00:02:10.410> no<00:02:10.500> reason<00:02:10.830> instead<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.129> playing<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
for no reason instead of playing the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.980 
for no reason instead of playing the
combat<00:02:11.879> as<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.270> should

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
combat as we should

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.660 
combat as we should
and<00:02:13.110> I'm<00:02:13.200> once<00:02:13.650> again<00:02:13.740> on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.040> stage<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.490> can't

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and I'm once again on the stage we can't

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.220 
and I'm once again on the stage we can't
just<00:02:14.760> fight<00:02:15.240> manly<00:02:15.540> because<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:15.870> another<00:02:16.050> hit

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
just fight manly because we another hit

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.560 
just fight manly because we another hit
and<00:02:16.910> yeah<00:02:17.910> that's<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.210> biggest<00:02:18.360> difference

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
and yeah that's the biggest difference

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.570 
and yeah that's the biggest difference
