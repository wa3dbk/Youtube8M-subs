00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
much go over his eye there one part to

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.160 
much go over his eye there one part to
be<00:02:16.250> wary<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.060> which<00:02:17.330> lot<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.720> people<00:02:17.959> forget

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
be wary of which lot of people forget

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.369 
be wary of which lot of people forget
between<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.250> eyes<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:20.599> can<00:02:20.720> feel<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.349> a

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
between the eyes you can feel as a

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.260 
between the eyes you can feel as a
little<00:02:21.650> hollow<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.160> there<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.910> there<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.239> be

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
little hollow in there so there will be

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.190 
little hollow in there so there will be
a<00:02:23.420> line<00:02:23.989> sort<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.040> between<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.239> eyes<00:02:26.360> actually

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
a line sort of between the eyes actually

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.670 
a line sort of between the eyes actually
I've<00:02:27.640> taken<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.819> too<00:02:29.030> low

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.070 

so<00:02:34.680> what<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.460> first<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> remember<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
so what you first have to remember is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.620 
so what you first have to remember is
the<00:02:37.590> Ford<00:02:37.980> has<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> highlight<00:02:38.730> there's<00:02:39.540> a
