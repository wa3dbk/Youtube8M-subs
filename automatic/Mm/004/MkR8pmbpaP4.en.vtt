00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello, it is again time to 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.429
 grill and since we are today 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.620
 are free and it is so nice and warm 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.620
 it mushroom crostini from go anywhere 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.090
 we have the go anywhere on indirect 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.860
 heat prepared a mini on ignition fireplace 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.020
 full of beechwood coal on the left 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.330
 side and the right side left blank 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.240
 then comes our cast aluminum flag 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.790
 and we fill this with some olive oil 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.439
 we sweat briefly on a vegetable onion 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.030
 we cut into stripes here 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.640
 and if this is something like that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.899
 appearance 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.059
 then we can already mushrooms 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 add the 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.020
 I have 250 grams of white here 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.930
 mushrooms 250 grams of brown mushrooms 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.940
 but that's up to you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.950
 Of course there are shiitake mushrooms as well 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.020
 or porcini or for extend 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.550
 whatever you want this recipe is 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.350
 simply nothing complicated yes 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.280
 But the good things do not have to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 always complicated 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.409
 is always interesting to see 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.570
 how many mushrooms you have to punch in 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.420
 so that you have something whatsoever 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.579
 we with a half glass of white 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 balsamic vinegar and leave this 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.500
 then simmer a little further 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 in between times with a pepper 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.350
 herbs mixture season with salt 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.789
 that this something like this can 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.770
 now watch here very nice time 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.539
 how much less that will be and then let it go 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.990
 the whole thing even further to me 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.990
 sizzle 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.240
 if the mushrooms mix about like that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.330
 looks like I give half a cup 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.310
 sour cream added and would the whole 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.050
 once around as soon as you cream your sour 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.400
 or sweet cream with a courts 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.510
 all have probably done so far 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.760
 better that you can not do it anymore 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.080
 should let long simmer otherwise the 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.790
 cream so just cuts off after that 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.790
 Pull pan to indirect heat 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.190
 for that we have extra on the good 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.550
 level rather a small corner free 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.550
 calmly 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.680
 Afterwards I take some bread slices 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.060
 in the case rye bread and the east 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.180
 short of caution here at the bbu 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.580
 anywhere so that you do not share 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.380
 char it comes out very well if 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.360
 Give this short something olive oil with 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.590
 brush some oil gives the whole 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.390
 still a nutty note as I said 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.580
 just need very short and then you can 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.580
 we do and even kipper 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.480
 if everything runs smoothly and the several 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.470
 would have made then the stock 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.390
 look like this 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.580
 Now we are distributing a generous one 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.290
 tablespoon of mushroom mixture 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.660
 a crostini and give something else 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.860
 grated cheese or what now too 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.010
 would fit would be a bit rubbed 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.150
 nutmeg or so but as I said the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.330
 should not be a complicated dish 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.710
 Just be mushroom crostini extremely 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.710
 delicious extremely easy 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.690
 Now we need the lid from the same 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.470
 go anywhere on the right 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.090
 indirect side 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.190
 lid on it and then would have the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.660
 still imagine something so valves 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.310
 They are on the right side after 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.830
 a few minutes then see the crostini 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.010
 so they are good for it too 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.380
 who would have thought it would be a mushroom after 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.850
 This is why many people call it small 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.310
 thanks for watching tried to times 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.590
 this is extremely easy but extreme 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.120
