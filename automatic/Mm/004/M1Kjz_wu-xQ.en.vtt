that you see here in this rifle as you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.890 
that you see here in this rifle as you
can<00:00:37.980> probably<00:00:38.160> guess<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:39.030> does<00:00:39.360> accommodate

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
can probably guess it does accommodate

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.569 
can probably guess it does accommodate
the<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.620> inch<00:00:40.800> light<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:41.309> we'll<00:00:41.489> get

the one inch light on there we'll get

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.060 
the one inch light on there we'll get
into<00:00:41.760> more<00:00:41.910> details<00:00:42.329> upon<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.470> it<00:00:43.770> works

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
into more details upon that but it works

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.590 
into more details upon that but it works
to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> front<00:00:44.520> sight<00:00:44.730> accommodates<00:00:45.449> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
to the front sight accommodates the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840 
to the front sight accommodates the
lights<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> may<00:00:46.230> already<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.850> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
lights that you may already have and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.670 
lights that you may already have and
we're<00:00:48.780> gonna<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:49.050> over<00:00:49.199> some<00:00:49.290> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> features

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
we're gonna go over some of the features

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
we're gonna go over some of the features
of<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> specs<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.420> what

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of it the specs of it and then just what

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.610 
of it the specs of it and then just what
I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.019> overall

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
I think of it overall

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.900 
I think of it overall
but<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.190> we'll<00:00:53.400> keep<00:00:53.430> putting<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> few

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
but for now we'll keep putting a few

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.640 
but for now we'll keep putting a few
rounds<00:00:54.059> downrange<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.440> into<00:00:55.589> a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
rounds downrange and then get into a

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.780 
rounds downrange and then get into a
closer<00:00:55.890> look<00:00:56.160> coming<00:00:56.400> up<00:00:56.550> next<00:00:58.579> those<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.699> you

five inch tubes the bodies out there

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.860 
five inch tubes the bodies out there
however<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.880> also<00:01:36.000> needs<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.510> one<00:01:36.540> other

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
however it also needs to have one other

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.720 
however it also needs to have one other
critical<00:01:37.320> dimension<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.520> which<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
critical dimension in there which is

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.340 
critical dimension in there which is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.860 
recess in there as if you can take a
look<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.370> at<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.060> underside<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> front

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
look here at the underside of the front

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.749 
look here at the underside of the front
sight<00:02:07.050> when<00:02:07.200> you're<00:02:07.290> actually<00:02:07.409> lowering<00:02:07.920> your

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
front sight post to adjust for elevation

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.640 
front sight post to adjust for elevation
and<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.750> via<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.019> include<00:02:13.440> tool

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and you do that via the include tool

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.080 
and you do that via the include tool
that<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.370> comes<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.970> and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
that you see here it comes with it and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.890 
that you see here it comes with it and
you<00:02:15.989> put<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.409> there<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.970> loosen<00:02:17.970> our<00:02:18.420> razor

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
you put it on there and loosen our razor

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.240 
you put it on there and loosen our razor
lower<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.290> should<00:02:19.470> say<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.799> front<00:02:20.040> sight<00:02:20.220> post

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
lower I should say the front sight post

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.509 
lower I should say the front sight post
it<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.150> go<00:02:21.269> down<00:02:21.480> into<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.110> recess<00:02:22.590> because

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
it can go down into that recess because

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.920 
it can go down into that recess because
