00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.730
 Hello dear dice game and around the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.449
 Friends today shows you the game 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 zombie cubes from the pegasus verlag 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.609
 play from 12 years for two and more 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.849
 player suitable with a duration of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.529
 about ten to twenty minutes as 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.410
 first thing for ever what you find in 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.329
 this can play content how did that build 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.960
 then play and how do they work 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.540
 regulate 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:45.660
 and now have fun with my video too 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:50.489
 You can find zombie dice in the can 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:58.609
 following game content a little 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:02.070
 instruction and 13 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.809
 that's all the content of this can and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.379
 Now show you how you all 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.379
 builds 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.000
 You can not really speak of 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.540
 Construction speaks for everything you do 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.740
 it just throws the thirteen back into the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.480
 to throw a dice cup and that is 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 but already the complete construction played 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.490
 and just as simple are the rules 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.670
 I 'll show you in the next video 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.670
 want 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.990
 What is Zombie Cube about? 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.570
 tommy threw it's about 13 the brains 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.520
 to gather before my opponent 13 brains 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.950
 that's why it's whole 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.780
 handy if you still pin and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.370
 leaf paper is looking at the he 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.580
 brains can write down the players 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.340
 have achieved so far and then there is 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.200
 just these dice and on the red 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.540
 roll the dice that are the most difficult 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.240
 For example, there is only one 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.120
 brain but very many 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.690
 shotguns the greens act 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.440
 Already more accustomed and less sporty 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.030
 flick and the yellow that the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.090
 In between there is the same amount 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.860
 brainwash blind so depending on 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.390
 I would have to dice those are 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.310
 chances to get brains or 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.470
 just shotguns and so you look 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.510
 that can not choose what you can 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.020
 would like to throw dice because of it 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.540
 First of all, all these dice 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:38.510
 Dice cups with these well through and 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.400
 then takes out three cube face down 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.900
 the mug out that means you do not know 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.410
 what colors and it has in these three 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.560
 cube 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.170
 you have to become one now and see what 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.930
 we have to play it three times 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.900
 which we uncover one in each case 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.390
 footprints that are dice I can here 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.200
 take me to me and if 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.000
 I would like to dice again then 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.519
 that counts as a dice and me 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.739
 I only take two cubes here 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.750
 the dice cup out because I have to 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.610
 dice always with three dice that is 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.400
 the important rule three cubes have to 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.450
 always be and the footsteps that is one 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.640
 escaping man that is the cube 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.620
 I ever when I want to roll new dice 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.070
 and only two cubes left from the bed 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.350
 out 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.600
 then there are just won and the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.900
 shotgun profits are natural 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.959
 Super 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 because I have one with you 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.209
 nice people opened and have a 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.790
 brain 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.070
 but there are also those who defend themselves 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.540
 quite like this shotgun and 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.209
 That's why I put things so now 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.890
 as you see there instruction 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.290
 Of course, looking left come 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.120
 the brains who diced the right ones 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.690
 Shows you have diced and before 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.920
 The footprints come to me that way 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.270
 problem is now following I can 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.670
 I say after every dice throw 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.150
 If I stop then I may 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.300
 jot the diced and the diced ones 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.490
 good cube but I continue and have 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.070
 sometime the third shotgun 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.010
 diced then my is complete 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.600
 diced that all dice brains 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.060
 then that was a round for the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.079
 katz so to speak and I do not get any 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.669
 point in this round 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.440
 that means I have to decide how 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.650
 For a long time I dare to dice again 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.110
 continue or just stop 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.360
 as shown, of course, I will continue 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.460
 that means the two stay here 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.540
 lie at the table 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.790
 I have to take this again 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.620
 allowed 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.530
 So now I just have to go here 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.940
 because by giving me two dice out 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.330
 then I have three cubes again 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.550
 dice is that this new and have it for 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.140
 For example, two more brains come to me 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.820
 color of the brains how fair does it matter 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.350
 it is only about the amount when I 13 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.420
 include total I've won 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.100
 but red brain does not tell now 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.690
 Only because they are less on the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.170
 dice on it are that it does not matter 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.330
 Now I have three like once the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.970
 Feet that is again a dice I 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.130
 have to roll again with dice if 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.660
 I still want dice and still 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.510
 just a shotgun that means I'm afraid 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.370
 I just want to go back now 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.370
 again questioned by two 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.750
 and now I have two 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.790
 shotguns four brains once the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.250
 Feet and now of course I would say 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.250
 okay how much brain write me on the 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.770
 slip on and stop so I have 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.710
 made points and then come easy 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.060
 again all dice and the next one 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.990
 player is in the row 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.660
 that's why the game is also with 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.010
 no matter how many pictures you play 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.210
 how many people do you participate in writing 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:49.760
 Just the dots on and we as 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:51.350
 first 13 has simply won that 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.270
 she was already my games 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.760
 Presentation and regular explanation of 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.890
 play zombie dice are so happy times 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.290
 want to record and lust 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.960
 human brains has the displays 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.910
 we play is of course absolutely right 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.010
 Just play dice that one 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.890
 in between can play at any time 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.760
 Quickly explained, I quickly played 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.190
 Hope to see you next time 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.350
 bradbury again and until then wish 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.350
