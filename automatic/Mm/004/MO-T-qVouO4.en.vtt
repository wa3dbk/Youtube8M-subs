 time of year which means we are all 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.590
 trying to escape the heat and eat one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.410
 although even intact 4 today will show 4 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.500
 version of the greek cold year under 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.430
 name frap and 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.939
 I hope that you will be interested 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.109
 it is very cool quenches thirst and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 Generally the most delicious dessert 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.329
 all enjoy browsing from ingredients 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.300
 we will need instant coffee whipped 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.870
 cream milk ice cream ice sugar and what 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 him for the area type decoration 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.640
 first we start cooking 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.489
 our coffee to the basis of our frappe 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.680
 we boil water and add there 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.870
 about 7 tablespoons of instant coffee 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 why is soluble because she is very 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.340
 well foams 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 after that add 5 spoons but in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 Basically, you can choose to taste and sugar 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.859
 I ran out brown sugar on these 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.909
 I can see that the hands are not from my shoulder 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.409
 solution we put our decanter with coffee at night 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.950
 in the fridge and give it well 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.950
 to infuse 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.650
 add 250 milliliters of ours 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.990
 cold coffee 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.990

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.219

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.219
 the resulting foam 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.010
 add whipped cream on top and you can 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.070
 still pour chocolate or caramel 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.070
