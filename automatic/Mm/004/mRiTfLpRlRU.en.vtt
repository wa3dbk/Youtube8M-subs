hello this is Campbell or ideas 942 I'm
going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.410> be<00:00:04.529> demoing<00:00:04.830> Python<00:00:05.700> buttons<00:00:06.259> so

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
going to be demoing Python buttons so

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.120 
going to be demoing Python buttons so
this<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:08.150> just<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.300> regular<00:00:09.540> panel<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.230> I've

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
this is just a regular panel and I've

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.680 
this is just a regular panel and I've
got<00:00:11.280> live<00:00:11.519> at<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.820> turned<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> can

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
got live at it turned on so I can

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.580 
got live at it turned on so I can
quickly<00:00:13.049> oops<00:00:14.900> quickly<00:00:15.900> comment<00:00:16.230> stuff<00:00:16.410> out

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
quickly oops quickly comment stuff out

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.859 
quickly oops quickly comment stuff out
or<00:00:16.740> change<00:00:17.010> things<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.520> as<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.630> see

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
or change things so as you can see

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.859 
or change things so as you can see
here's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.199> custom<00:00:19.789> custom<00:00:20.789> button<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
here's a custom custom button which is a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.189 
here's a custom custom button which is a
Python<00:00:22.710> defined<00:00:23.100> button<00:00:23.640> type<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.660> opposed<00:00:25.050> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
Python defined button type as opposed to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
Python defined button type as opposed to
the<00:00:25.320> layouts<00:00:25.650> which<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:25.980> already<00:00:26.099> defined<00:00:26.609> in

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the layouts which are already defined in

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.259 
the layouts which are already defined in
Python<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> my<00:00:28.769> aim<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.730> was<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.119> make

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
Python so my aim for this was to make

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.819 
Python so my aim for this was to make
easy<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.260> prototype<00:00:32.329> buttons<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.649> see

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
easy to prototype buttons so you can see

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.660 
easy to prototype buttons so you can see
here<00:00:36.230> this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> few<00:00:37.980> things<00:00:38.100> I've<00:00:38.309> done<00:00:38.340> just

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
here this is a few things I've done just

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.369 
here this is a few things I've done just
so<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> reloads<00:00:39.379> on<00:00:40.379> redraw<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.079> put<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> test

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so it reloads on redraw and put the test

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.770 
so it reloads on redraw and put the test
slider<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.430> path<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> custom<00:00:45.480> button

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
slider this is path to the custom button

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
slider this is path to the custom button
which<00:00:45.989> calls<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:47.039> module<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.030> I've<00:00:48.090> got<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
which calls this module so I've got the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.209 
which calls this module so I've got the
draw<00:00:48.450> function<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:49.110> takes<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.469> rectangle<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
draw function here takes a rectangle and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.810 
draw function here takes a rectangle and
users<00:00:51.030> OpenGL<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.320> draw<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> rectangles<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
users OpenGL to draw the rectangles and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.260 
users OpenGL to draw the rectangles and
set<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> colors<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:56.190> quite<00:00:56.399> nice<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
set of colors and it's quite nice in the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.139 
set of colors and it's quite nice in the
way<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:58.129> easily<00:00:59.129> change<00:00:59.340> change

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
way that you can easily change change

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.200 
way that you can easily change change
things<00:01:00.949> okay<00:01:01.949> colors<00:01:02.309> aren't<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.180> best

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
things okay colors aren't on the best

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.920 
things okay colors aren't on the best
example<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.129> can

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.120 

yeah<00:01:12.930> change<00:01:13.320> all<00:01:13.470> sorts<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.800> minor<00:01:14.160> things<00:01:16.130> so

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
yeah change all sorts of minor things so

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.980 
yeah change all sorts of minor things so
this<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.400> lets<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.450> sorts<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
this really lets you do all sorts of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.190 
this really lets you do all sorts of
button<00:01:19.290> types<00:01:19.970> because<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.120> sliders<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.720> not

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
button types because the sliders not not

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.490 
button types because the sliders not not
so<00:01:22.410> unique<00:01:22.740> i<00:01:22.920> thought<00:01:23.160> i'd<00:01:23.310> add<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.550> dial<00:01:24.500> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
so unique i thought i'd add a dial it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.070 
so unique i thought i'd add a dial it
uses<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> same<00:01:26.190> event<00:01:26.490> handling<00:01:26.790> code<00:01:27.120> down

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
uses the same event handling code down

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.680 
uses the same event handling code down
here<00:01:28.440> but<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.160> has<00:01:29.280> different<00:01:29.460> draw<00:01:29.850> draw

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
here but it has different draw draw

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.170 
here but it has different draw draw
functionality<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:32.550> i'll<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.120> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
functionality so i'll just make this a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630 
functionality so i'll just make this a
little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.479> bigger<00:01:33.950> decided<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> use<00:01:35.220> units

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
little bit bigger decided to use units

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
little bit bigger decided to use units
for<00:01:35.850> other<00:01:35.940> than<00:01:36.120> pixels<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.870> can<00:01:37.110> sort

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
for other than pixels so you can sort

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
for other than pixels so you can sort
scales<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.760> rest<00:01:38.910> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> interface<00:01:39.470> if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
scales with the rest of the interface if

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
scales with the rest of the interface if
it<00:01:40.620> used<00:01:40.800> pixels<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.370> would<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.060> wouldn't

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it used pixels it would it wouldn't

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
it used pixels it would it wouldn't
scale<00:01:42.570> properly<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:43.920> wouldn't<00:01:44.130> really

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
scale properly and it wouldn't really

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.469 
scale properly and it wouldn't really
fit<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.580> well<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> layout<00:01:45.090> engine<00:01:46.310> um<00:01:47.479> yeah

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
fit as well with a layout engine um yeah

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.170 
fit as well with a layout engine um yeah
so<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.430> change<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.090> text<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:54.650> or

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
so you can just change the text here or

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
so you can just change the text here or
the<00:01:57.180> number<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.479> sides<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:02.040> my<00:02:02.190> thinking<00:02:02.400> was

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the number of sides so my thinking was

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700 
the number of sides so my thinking was
that<00:02:02.700> possibly<00:02:03.180> people<00:02:04.050> who<00:02:04.170> aren't<00:02:04.440> really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that possibly people who aren't really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.320 
that possibly people who aren't really
already<00:02:05.040> involved<00:02:05.400> with<00:02:05.580> blenders<00:02:05.940> interface

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
already involved with blenders interface

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.940 
already involved with blenders interface
since<00:02:06.869> there's<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> lot<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> noise<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
since there's a lot of noise at the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.880 
since there's a lot of noise at the
moment<00:02:08.250> about<00:02:08.340> linda's<00:02:09.179> interface<00:02:09.890> needing

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
moment about linda's interface needing

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340 
moment about linda's interface needing
to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.100> improved<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.270> way<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.810> get

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
to be improved this is one way to get

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.699 
to be improved this is one way to get
involved<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.100> be<00:02:14.850> able<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.209> prototype

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
involved and to be able to prototype

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.470 
involved and to be able to prototype
yeah<00:02:16.709> all<00:02:17.010> sorts<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.430> different<00:02:17.970> interface

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
yeah all sorts of different interface

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.840 
yeah all sorts of different interface
ideas<00:02:19.080> quickly<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:20.280> course<00:02:20.489> there's<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> lot

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
ideas quickly of course there's a lot

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.699 
ideas quickly of course there's a lot
more<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.209> then<00:02:21.989> are<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.440> different
