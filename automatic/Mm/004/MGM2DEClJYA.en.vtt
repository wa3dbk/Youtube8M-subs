00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.330 
but let's say I needed to highlight
Snagit<00:04:33.539> 10<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:37.229> just<00:04:37.440> click<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.800> drag<00:04:37.860> again

and<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:39.389> highlights<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:40.169> then<00:04:40.349> i<00:04:40.440> can

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
and it highlights and then i can

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.240

highlight<00:04:41.060> Snagit<00:04:42.060> editor<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.650> then<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.949> stock

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
highlight Snagit editor and then I stock

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.640

blink<00:04:44.610> signs
