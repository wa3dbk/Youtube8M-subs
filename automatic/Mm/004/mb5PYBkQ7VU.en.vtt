except<00:01:10.680> dragon<00:01:11.010> story<00:01:11.400> doesn't<00:01:11.670> anyways<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
except dragon story doesn't anyways it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.750 
except dragon story doesn't anyways it
has<00:01:12.750> been<00:01:13.020> tested<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.799> need<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.250> use<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
has been tested that you need to use the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.039 
has been tested that you need to use the
combination<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:16.250> water<00:01:17.250> dragon<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
combination of water dragon and the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
combination of water dragon and the
magic<00:01:19.650> dragon<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.189> an<00:01:20.280> opportunity<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> get

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
magic dragon for an opportunity to get

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.539 
magic dragon for an opportunity to get
this<00:01:21.570> dragon<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.619> keep<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.009> mind<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
this dragon and do keep in mind that the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
this dragon and do keep in mind that the
dragon<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> super<00:01:24.630> rare<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.200> means<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
dragon is super rare which means that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.539 
dragon is super rare which means that
it's<00:01:25.920> rather<00:01:26.700> difficult<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> best

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it's rather difficult to get the best

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
it's rather difficult to get the best
combination<00:01:30.270> I'd<00:01:30.479> say<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.810> any<00:01:31.140> combination

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
combination I'd say is any combination

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.270 
combination I'd say is any combination
with<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.549> blue<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.630> purple<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
with just blue and purple because that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
with just blue and purple because that
eliminates<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> possibility<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.720> getting

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
eliminates the possibility of getting

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
eliminates the possibility of getting
other<00:01:37.170> type<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> dragons<00:01:38.130> anyways<00:01:38.790> what
