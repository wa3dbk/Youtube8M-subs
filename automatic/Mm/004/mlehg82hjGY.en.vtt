00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:06.529
 hi friends today i will introduce you to 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.790
 children's playroom 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.340
 kitchen tefal from smoby this kitchen tefal co 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.370
 light with sound 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.800
 and runs on batteries in her set 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:24.010
 19 accessories included 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.010
 as seen in the upper right corner 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.340
 here and spoon spoon squirrel knives 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.600
 you can count 9 plates over 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.710
 the pieces here are clearly visible very clearly 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.620
 can be seen rather spiritual oven through 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.040
 closet upstairs on a vertical rack 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.610
 there are hours when you cook children 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.610
 should like to lay their own time 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.480
 on cooking some dishes and 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.010
 watching the time while it's over 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.899
 preparing time so that you don't 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.199
 just so it was really watched 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.850
 for a while but this kit 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.820
 kitchen kit it is more suitable 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.600
 of course girl and here you see on this 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.000
 slide like a girl diligently prepare 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 cook some recipe dishes rather but 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 does not know the recipe, she's the first time 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.780
 I faced with this and probably thinks that 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.690
 probably mom will certainly help mom 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.180
 Of course, she will help. 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.190
 will guide the child and maybe even 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 the girl will already know some recipes 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.930
 and she will be happy to cook them 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.230
 cook now there she has some 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.380
 chicken no she 's washing the dishes it 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.820
 my to me for a little rack with 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 the pan is already on the stove 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.400
 hang up the chicken prepares to prepare 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.010
 there will be a girl, well, this kit is like me 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.060
 said you will fit the girls but also 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.710
 and the boys are happy to cook on 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 next slide we see that among 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.240
 girls is one boy he's with 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.990
 pleasure with a smile with interest 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.319
 prepares a 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.149
 Something is hanging there someone already 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.980
 cooked here the girl on the left is something 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.930
 cooked some salad there 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.330
 the next girl downstairs she carries holds 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.150
 empty cup it is of course something 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.630
 least this is probably a recipe trailer here 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.420
 wants to cook something and on the right in the top 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.459
 corner girls cook something flour one 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.580
 certainly not the oven will probably be in the oven 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:39.010
 and here you can clearly see the wash from the right 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.170
 the sides here are the screen and here's the tap and there 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.700
 on the tap on top there is a button on it 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.299
 you press and here from this the wash emits 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.500
 the sound of flowing water is very impressive and everything 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.930
 really very interesting yet i'm not 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.239
 I would forget to say about cats cats here 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.180
 appeared they already began to lick their lips 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.700
 appetizing look at all the children so to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.310
 take it seriously and for some reason mom is here 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.359
 no, mom always feeds them and here she is 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.540
 Does cats feed as it were? 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.870
 puncture so that cats do not forget everything here 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.870
 for real 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.290
 well, on the next slide, I'll tell you about 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.670
 burners 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.349
 it's 2 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.650
 comfortable stove stove here two 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.190
 burners on one burner on the left here 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.150
 There is a date in there you can see a tomato 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.540
 prepare fruits vegetables for soup and when 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.920
 turn on push button 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:50.060
 a spectacular sound is made 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.209
 boiling broth sound boiling liquid 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.050
 that's how real really is but right comfort 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.910
 slightly less 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:04.300
 there chicken roasts I see the same and when 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.300
 turn on the ring and give the sound 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.940
 fizz in the dish 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.340
 everything is truly everything is like in life 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.530

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.139

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.090

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.050

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.190

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.790
 kitchen stove there put here let's say 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.699
 here the chicken will be cooked and 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.510
 you connect and you can see very well here 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:44.560
 the sink is still there or the pot of soup 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.470
 will cook already stands on a big 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.320
 burners on a small roast usually 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.500
 burners something second or in the oven as 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.930
 here now now this way 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.120
 everything is interesting here it is arranged and everything 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.120
 really all very 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.520
 cool but interesting it is here here 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.040
 Only 19 items can be bought later. 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.220
 add it already depending on 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.530
 how to turn around here how i will and 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.080
 how will interest be shown as if 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.590
 studied all the items for cooking 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.280

 Enjoy your meal, good and tasty 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.350
 dishes and adults 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.080
 time appealing to just get settled 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.520
 more often holidays give children a holiday 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:47.830
 children give toys to children and make these 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:52.620
 Holidays more often here just give the children 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.620
 happiness simple child happiness 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.969
 and play more with them 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.099
 because the game is always 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.329
 there is a mutual understanding between 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.340
 older children 

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:07.900
 that's great 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.460
 it is very important 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.410
