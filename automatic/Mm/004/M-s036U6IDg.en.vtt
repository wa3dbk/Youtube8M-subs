00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:25.198
The brilliant sunshine
Another day starting 

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:31.066
We are trying to appeal
To each other 

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:37.991
Your counter punch coming towards me
Game set knock down and I 

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:40.536
I’m into you again 

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:48.178
Sunglass, sunglass, girlI hope you go blind for me 

00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:55.786
Please hide your eyes
Sunglass, sunglass, girl

00:00:56.392 --> 00:01:01.340
I draw you with my eyes closed
With color of love 

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:11.931
When I saw you for the first time
I felt like as if I went blind 

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:21.916
Those pretty eyes smiling at me
I’ll make it go away so you can see only me 

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:29.538
Sunglass, sunglass, girlI hope you go blind for me 

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:36.704
Please hide your eyes
Sunglass, sunglass, girl

00:01:37.302 --> 00:01:41.702
I draw you with my eyes closed
With color of love 

00:01:42.263 --> 00:01:47.005
There is no balance in my heart
Only you can be deposited 

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:52.330
It’s always empty just like a 
Bungeoppang without bean jam 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.655
It’s always 100%trustworhty
Safety is OK

00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:58.817
Do you want to me in my big arms
Just like your daddy 

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:02.498
For how long are you going to
Push and pull 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.846
Sunglass, sunglass, girlI hope you go blind for me 

00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:17.533
Please hide your eyes
Sunglass, sunglass, girl

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:22.756
I draw you with my eyes closed
With color of love 

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:30.254
Sunglass, sunglass, girlI hope you go blind for me 

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:38.178
Please hide your eyes
Sunglass, sunglass, girl

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:43.794
I draw you with my eyes closed
With color of love
