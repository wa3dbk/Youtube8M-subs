00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.510
 and that's it 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.510
 yes 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.890
 you have to tactical be welcome to a 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.110
 new video and if we're in my field that 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.410
 of editing and we are in version 0 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.660
 point 12.1 alfa wheel 11 I have them 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.820
 a texture well known to many 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.200
 people and this texture right now 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.390
 I remember the name but you already 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.640
 will have seen in the title of the video this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.050
 texture is 100% carried by me and therefore 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.390
 I celestial that you because you 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.770
 can use and totally and well 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.930
 this texture the truth I liked it 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.030
 enough and then I do it so that 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.800
 see it here the review and good as 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.719
 we see what the wallpaper would be 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.730
 and the title if they change as we can 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.469
 observe I find what would be the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.359
 buttons we see that they are normal because 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.829
 do not change them, let's get into what 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.379
 would be the world textures revision 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.120
 can do the most complete review well 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.789
 so let's wait for the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.129
 world and well some new ones change what 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.140
 that would be the zombie and you are worthy too 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.910
 as we can observe the others and 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.520
 also this texture I liked because it 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.040
 gives a touch like the one in 3d and then the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.070
 it really looks super pretty cool this 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.630
 texture looks like 16 x 16 but it's not 16 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.330
 x 16 64 x 64 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.490
 but 64 so it makes me appeared 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.850
 action at pressures where I started 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.920
 appeared as 64 and can see for you but 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.740
 the 16 the truth did not know also so 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.750
 which the for you in 64 so it looks 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.530
 so it looks like they're 16 but the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.160
 truth is 64 we see in the crystals and 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.870
 confirms that they are 64 and this texture to 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
 I liked it a lot and I hope that also 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.320
 you like it as we see in what 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.120
 road route 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.400
 I do not think I do not change him, I do not think 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.110
 changes does not change in fact and good for 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.670
 that the trunks we see that the part of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.980
 the trunks upstairs looks super cool 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 to see if I remove the make in 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.850
 movement because it does not change it's just me 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.140
 causing a bit of long and good as 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.900
 we see here the rails the trunks 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.820
 the top part what would be the car 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.460
 Mine is also super great I 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.320
 quite liked the water because it is supposed 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.060
 that if you change but I think I see him 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.160
 no change 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.170
 until what it would be is all 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.790
 different types of different flowers 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.890
 types of stairs that looks super 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.020
 great and because good here we have 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.970
 the blocks how can we be 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.739
 watching if they want to download this 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.360
 great finished texture description 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.580
 of the video I will leave you what would be the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.170
 link where the publication will be sent 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.550
 my facebook page in the publication 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 you will find the files for 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.930
 download what would be the apk point and the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.540
 point if the to sin is the greatest has 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.310
 modified with the texture and point 5 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.780
 obviously for the blog launcher also 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.569
 if in case it does not work in the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.519
 sin then you can put it 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.590
 what would be in your blog launcher with the 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.269
 point zip or put it manually to 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.340
 xumetra because of editing in case 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.630
 do not know how to do that clarified reception 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.800
 He said what a little tutorial takes 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.080
 so you obviously 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.390
 download and good as we do here 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.910
 what would be the stone cut I put it 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.130
 so I put him in my little autograph to 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.880
 that they realize that I give them this way 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.620
 small things that are seen so that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.990
 good those little things that I put them 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.880
 to discover that in my texture and then 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.980
 good good what is not my 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.770
 texture that for you so well then 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.410
 guys then I'm still starting 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.660
 if it does not work as I say 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.910
 in the pica you can foresee it by putting it 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.370
 you to the zip point so well then 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.920
 guys disturbs me where he averaged there and 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.830
 So it's simple, it's giving me a lot 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.680
 like but it's because I do not know why 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.900
 good guys maybe because it 's infinite 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.240
 the world and maybe this was done wrong but 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.520
 good guys then in case 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.550
 want to do the review or something else 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.500
 Well, I'm not asking you not to leave a link 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.420
 direct if you do not send it simply what 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.800
 that this video is that they are the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.380
 download from here so they are giving me 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.060
 credits and thus supporting what would be the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.070
 effort that I do bow part of this 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.320
 texture so good as we can see 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.810
 there are all the tools and the camera 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.850
 is one of the ones that I liked it is that 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.000
 I liked it but I really do not see any 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.830
 change but that supposes if it changes what 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.049
 look here what the crops would be 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.270
 at the door this amazing crops 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.120
 because it is assumed that if only changes 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.640
 what would be the potato and this thing the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.190
 potato and carrot the pictures then 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.410
 I do not see any difference 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.020
 this we will see here the modes 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.400
 modes some change and some honor like 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.770
 you will already know what is lenderman 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.699
 needle I hope my voice 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.379
 I'm a bit like it 's very worn 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.319
 my voice and then good as we see then 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.050
 we will remove to the chicken something that would be that the 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.840
 cow is super cool just like him 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.430
 is well has the nobody rada but good 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.050
 here the sheep does not change as we can 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.659
 observe the logo only change the one that does not 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.460
 is domesticated and the champ and cow if 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.949
 change ok how can we be 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.139
 noting if the chamba kl itself changes 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.909
 I think that also yes it also changes what 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.560
 that would be the skeleton also changes in 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.659
 what would be Islam and the 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.030
 magnas if they not change too Lenderman 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.240
 change what the spider would be either 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.310
 change the bat if it changes and a flow 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.009
 around here the zombie does not change either 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.930
 victims either the tripod if it changes 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.780
 over here we find the spider 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.210
 caves that is not but this is supposed 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.340
 if it changes and this one obviously is only 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.009
 the pumpkin I think so but I do not know if 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.719
 also but good, this also matters 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.090
 change how we can be observing not 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:38.430
 I know if they notice it like obsidian and 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.139
 producing as we see here we have this 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.969
 stone this stone looks super cool the 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.759
 I really liked pretty 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.860
 extra pain text I did not like because I did not 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.989
 lose the essence of minecraft we see 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.209
 here gas gas also changes and 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:53.639
 can see afterwards he 's really liking what 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:55.289
 that would be the texture if they liked it 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.839
 I could be greatly diminished the 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.269
 guys and then they share the video with their 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.129
 friends so they know about this texture and 

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:04.559
 all that share so that every time 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.899
 let's be more people in this family in 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:08.939
 this channel and obviously for that 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:11.669
 more people find out about this channel and 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:14.189
 see the guys after I liked it 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.949
 I say goodbye and see you up next 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:18.270
 video beware the chao chao and even the 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.700
 next 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.560
 as we see before saying goodbye to the video 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.780
 here we have what these items would be 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.130
 everything is pretty cool how we can 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.050
 to be observing the truth I liked it 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.400
 quite the texture of the armor I think 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.020
 that changes it but in the way 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.270
 Enchantment is supposed to change 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.490
 good guys that was all in my part or 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.490
 so I say goodbye and until next time
