00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.889
 the price of a respectable derby 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.450
 fist fight with a neighbor and 30 cigarettes 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.730
 today it was a triumph for the non 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 smokers and you left san siro a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.260
 arm with rivals 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.080
 it was derby number 177 and will be remembered 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.580
 for the less exciting even if the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 bass drum he wanted in danger 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.170
 trademark and maybe chapel resounded from 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.260
 days much more than the drums and gods 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.630
 tree frogs present at the stadium 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.340
 188 million of collection means that i 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 Milanese are fond of the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.950
 tradition but today's panettone was 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.899
 less tasty than usual is not the fault of 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.239
 Chiappella or Milanese brand 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.480
 authentic but without miraculous recipes 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.879
 not even for the big occasion 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.219
 bench responsibility in short 0 the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.100
 convent of these times passes material 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.090
 autarchic even if in some cases 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.090
 paid in gold 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.640
 area or no area there is little to tell 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.020
 on this derby, 1 to 1 ended 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.759
 can complain 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.579
 was a derby for chamomile and for 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.340
 branded ladder emotions 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.369
 not even talk about say those of Milan 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.020
 could be scored with silva and bordon ha 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.000
 performed a miracle 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.799
 Interisti answer what 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.079
 we should say that we have gone into 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.250
 advantage with marigney and we stayed there 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.929
 a beautiful piece 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.429
 but if he was offside nastasis 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.929
 replicate those of Milan 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.929
 please observe moviola 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.310
 the second half was used to demonstrate 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.440
 that a draw would have been fairer 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.600
 good or bad Milan has had more things 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.970
 to say even if without particular 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.400
 imagination sometimes happens that 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.630
 the draw is undeserved and that does 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.399
 controversy 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.459
 today instead everything had to go second 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.709
 a sort of historic compromise in the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.090
 meaning that they should not be registered 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.790
 regrets 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.310
 in fact, here is the draw of Milan marks 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.050
 silva great a title slash 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.640
 revival 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.950
 ends one by one everyone says it is 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.610
 better so two sorry interiors is a 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.610
 other things
