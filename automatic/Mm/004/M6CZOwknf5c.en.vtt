straight if you start it because of the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750 
straight if you start it because of the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
pull it back straight it has to go

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
pull it back straight it has to go
straight<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> put<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.809> against

your shoulder again but your cue stick

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.210 
your shoulder again but your cue stick

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
actually starts out to the side when you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
actually starts out to the side when you
pull<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> back<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.360> goes<00:01:09.540> crooked<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.080> it's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
pull it back it goes crooked and it's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.330 
pull it back it goes crooked and it's
all<00:01:10.350> over<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> place<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.280> see

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
all over the place now as you can see

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.460 
all over the place now as you can see
when<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> goes<00:01:11.850> crooked<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.840> tip<00:01:13.049> goes<00:01:13.260> all

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
when it goes crooked the tip goes all

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
when it goes crooked the tip goes all
over<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.740> place<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.909> whole<00:01:15.060> concept<00:01:15.270> here

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
over the place so the whole concept here

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.969 
over the place so the whole concept here
is<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> start<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.470> cue<00:01:16.740> sticks

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
is to start with your cue sticks

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.710 
is to start with your cue sticks
straight<00:01:17.220> under<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.670> shoulder<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> we're

straight under your shoulder and we're
gonna<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.320> bit<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> corrective

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
gonna have a little bit of a corrective

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.710 
gonna have a little bit of a corrective
demonstration<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> later<00:01:21.509> how<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
demonstration of that later how to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
demonstration of that later how to
actually<00:01:21.930> program<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.759> now

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
actually program that but for right now

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.130

shoulder and you pull it back it'll

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
shoulder and you pull it back it'll
swing<00:01:28.350> straight<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:29.579> we're<00:01:30.030> gonna

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
swing straight now we're gonna

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
swing straight now we're gonna
illustrate<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:30.900> by<00:01:31.200> taking<00:01:31.350> our

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
illustrate that here by taking our

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.710 
illustrate that here by taking our
position<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> table<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:33.240> effective

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
position at the table and how effective

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840 
position at the table and how effective
this<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.200> whenever<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.460> approach<00:01:35.670> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this can be whenever your approach is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660 
this can be whenever your approach is
shot<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> line<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:38.070> cue<00:01:38.400> stick

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
shot you want to line up your cue stick

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
shot you want to line up your cue stick
and<00:01:38.909> drop<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> down<00:01:39.299> by<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.689> side<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:39.960> it's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and drop it down by your side so it's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
and drop it down by your side so it's
right<00:01:40.409> underneath<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> shoulder<00:01:41.250> step<00:01:42.030> into

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
right underneath the shoulder step into

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
back and forth and acoustics should be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.649 
back and forth and acoustics should be
swinging<00:01:47.369> straight<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> started<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
swinging straight because you started it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450

once<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.970> while<00:01:51.119> you'll<00:01:51.270> find<00:01:51.329> players<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
once in a while you'll find players that

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.830 
once in a while you'll find players that
will<00:01:53.040> actually<00:01:53.579> slide<00:01:54.210> into<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> shop<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
will actually slide into the shop and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.630 
will actually slide into the shop and
aside<00:01:55.229> they'll<00:01:55.470> start<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
aside they'll start over like this and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.580 
aside they'll start over like this and
they'll<00:01:57.149> slide<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> ball

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
they'll slide in like this to the ball

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.280 
they'll slide in like this to the ball
they<00:01:59.219> come<00:01:59.490> down<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.030> they're<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.719> cue<00:02:01.020> isn't

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
they come down and they're not cue isn't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.539 
they come down and they're not cue isn't
really<00:02:01.469> under<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> shoulder<00:02:02.130> because<00:02:02.430> they

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
really under the shoulder because they

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.490 
really under the shoulder because they
didn't<00:02:02.820> step<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.299> straight<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> shot<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
didn't step in straight to the shot and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
didn't step in straight to the shot and
sometimes<00:02:05.369> they'll<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.520> over<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
sometimes they'll be over like this and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
sometimes they'll be over like this and
they'll<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.509> other<00:02:06.600> way<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.899> they<00:02:07.020> won't

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
they'll go the other way and they won't

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.309 
they'll go the other way and they won't
start<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> straight<00:02:08.369> line<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.869> happens

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
start with a straight line so it happens

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.050 
start with a straight line so it happens
all<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.470> time<00:02:10.619> players<00:02:11.069> will<00:02:11.280> push<00:02:11.670> into<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
all the time players will push into the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.780 
all the time players will push into the
shot<00:02:12.300> they'll<00:02:12.989> pull<00:02:13.470> in

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
shot they'll pull in

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.970 
shot they'll pull in
the<00:02:13.849> shot<00:02:14.090> instead<00:02:14.989> of<00:02:15.140> stepping<00:02:15.590> back<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the shot instead of stepping back on a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.259 
the shot instead of stepping back on a
shot<00:02:16.189> and<00:02:16.340> stepping<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.760> with<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.909> cue<00:02:17.090> out<00:02:17.180> of

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
shot and stepping in with the cue out of

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.209 
shot and stepping in with the cue out of
their<00:02:17.360> shoulder<00:02:17.780> they<00:02:18.260> get<00:02:18.439> that<00:02:18.590> off<00:02:18.829> can

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
their shoulder they get that off can

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.429 
their shoulder they get that off can
alignment<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:19.969> shot<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.049> very<00:02:21.200> very

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
alignment to the shot so it's very very

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.860 
alignment to the shot so it's very very
important<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.370> when<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:22.609> step<00:02:22.939> in<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
important that when you step in that the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.330 
important that when you step in that the
acoustic<00:02:24.019> is<00:02:24.349> straight<00:02:24.680> under<00:02:24.890> your<00:02:25.010> shoulder

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
acoustic is straight under your shoulder

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.309 
acoustic is straight under your shoulder
just<00:02:25.519> like<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.730> plumb<00:02:26.030> bob<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.750> when<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.989> swing

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
just like a plumb bob so when you swing

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.259 
just like a plumb bob so when you swing
it<00:02:27.349> it<00:02:27.950> has<00:02:28.159> to<00:02:28.310> go<00:02:28.430> straight<00:02:28.760> now<00:02:28.939> all<00:02:29.120> my

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
it it has to go straight now all my

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.179 
it it has to go straight now all my
footwork<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.170> if<00:02:30.379> you're<00:02:31.010> watching

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
footwork on this if you're watching

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.830 
footwork on this if you're watching
somebody<00:02:31.670> play<00:02:31.730> sometime<00:02:32.420> you'll<00:02:32.599> know<00:02:32.750> if

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
somebody play sometime you'll know if

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.089 
somebody play sometime you'll know if
their<00:02:32.989> acoustic<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.530> straight<00:02:33.799> under<00:02:33.950> their

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
their acoustic is straight under their

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.679 
their acoustic is straight under their
shoulder<00:02:34.400> because<00:02:34.730> when<00:02:35.239> they<00:02:35.329> take<00:02:35.540> your

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
shoulder because when they take your

this it won't move opposing to the cue

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.250 
this it won't move opposing to the cue
if<00:02:49.099> you<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:49.970> somebody<00:02:50.209> playing<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.659> game<00:02:50.959> and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
if you see somebody playing the game and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.349 
if you see somebody playing the game and
they're<00:02:51.739> moving<00:02:51.889> their<00:02:52.189> foot<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:52.669> this<00:02:52.700> when

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
they're moving their foot like this when

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.360 
they're moving their foot like this when
they're<00:02:53.480> getting<00:02:53.540> their<00:02:53.689> balance<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:55.129> know

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
they're getting their balance you know

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.250 
they're getting their balance you know
that<00:02:55.730> their<00:02:55.879> acoustic<00:02:56.120> hasn't<00:02:56.659> started<00:02:56.989> under

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
that their acoustic hasn't started under

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.770 
that their acoustic hasn't started under
their<00:02:57.409> shoulder<00:02:57.859> so<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.209> actually<00:02:59.569> has<00:02:59.750> a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
their shoulder so this is actually has a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.569 
their shoulder so this is actually has a
double<00:03:00.169> whammy<00:03:00.290> effect<00:03:00.769> for<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.099> a<00:03:01.129> double

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
double whammy effect for you a double

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.089 
double whammy effect for you a double
positive<00:03:01.819> effect<00:03:02.359> you<00:03:02.930> can<00:03:03.109> actually<00:03:03.470> program

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
positive effect you can actually program

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.830 
positive effect you can actually program
this<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.549> your<00:03:04.700> own<00:03:04.730> game<00:03:05.090> put<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.629> cue<00:03:05.780> stick

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
this to your own game put the cue stick

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.149 
this to your own game put the cue stick
under<00:03:06.169> you're<00:03:06.290> sort<00:03:06.439> of<00:03:06.470> like<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.620> plumb<00:03:06.889> bob<00:03:06.919> to

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
under you're sort of like a plumb bob to

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.250 
under you're sort of like a plumb bob to
start<00:03:07.430> with<00:03:07.609> then<00:03:08.389> it<00:03:08.569> will<00:03:08.689> swing<00:03:08.989> straight

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
start with then it will swing straight

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.809 
start with then it will swing straight
automatically<00:03:10.010> because<00:03:10.189> it<00:03:10.310> started<00:03:10.609> from<00:03:10.669> a

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
automatically because it started from a

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.849 
automatically because it started from a
straight<00:03:11.030> position<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.439> other<00:03:12.590> side

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
straight position and on the other side
