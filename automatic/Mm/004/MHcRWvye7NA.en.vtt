00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.110
 Hi, how are you? 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.010
 I'm here again like conquering a man 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.010
 point shipping 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.730
 I'm sure that at this stage 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.199
 there you are already very confident and already 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 You must be feeling this. 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.310
 perceiving things in a way 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.179
 Different and I'm here to talk today. 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.529
 with you about the situation that is let's 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.829
 say an extremely 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.380
 important that you already looked 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.370
 so you want to have the second you go 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.860
 have the second contact with him 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.559
 probably by connection 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.670
 usually this big question is cool 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:55.469
 not to connect the very curious question but 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 other situations also end but you 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 can work in his company 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 I flew Monday a job and now 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.920
 how are you going to act in these 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920
 situations 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.670
 regardless of the situation 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.390
 It's the first thing you have to do. 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.810
 and you got it, then you're going to have it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 that know how to measure your expectation will 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.100
 to say no more is not exaggerated 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.590
 too much depending on how cool it was 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:36.119
 keep it always will tell you if you 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 It is very good will call such a wait a 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.990
 I have little car he asked for you. 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 turn on 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 then you have to keep in mind that the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 expectation is that you have not the same 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.259
 thing of the intimacy that you have with him 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.689
 so what will you say what level you 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.420
 floor does this expectation and the cicinho 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.460
 intimacy that you have to stay 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.469
 First time, then it's just a reminder. 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.740
 Just for you and take it easy. 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.790
 one time you may have several 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.620
 situations, right? 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.920
 z who called it asked you to call 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.100
 and I must call to get a contact 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.950
 facebook whatever 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.400
 You got a contact from him so if he 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.470
 asked for green signal league without exaggeration is 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.580
 break trust will not be if 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.770
 offering 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.400
 It's going to be one thing I'm sure legal and 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.270
 Do not you call yourself and let the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.840
 thing to roll 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.460
 if he does not ask you to call one 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.820
 contact but nothing you just have not done 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.010
 and did not say anything about calling I would 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.360
 send a message 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.570
 Wait a few days. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.040
 message not those mon messages 8 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.660
 I loved that day 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 So let's go, it was great, I did not try. 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.650
 I find extremely efficient message 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.650
 simple natural and very nice 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.750
 Only you wrote hi, how are you? 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.640
 I want to make a face of shy and 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.200
 something else more so you sending 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.850
 Very well to say you're moving to 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.600
 he is responsible for giving the first 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.970
 signal is extremely interesting for 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.620
 hi you then all well and just how 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.660
 He will answer the answer well. 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.140
 say a lot 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.450
 so do have to do so in case 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.790
 I did not ask you to call him 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.250
 answering is just ready 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.860
 developing conversation will usually have 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.170
 a passage that is to mark the end of the month 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.959
 and do not respond very excited 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.380
 You can help it be the way of it. 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.420
 huh 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.760
 He may be wanting to dismiss. 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.769
 So with everyone, anyway, is it with relatives? 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.330
 his way of his personality 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.760
 so you can pull a bit of 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.950
 subject and seeing if he really is 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.690
 he cut 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.660
 looks have to go after we talk and 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.090
 I really think I'm a little older. 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.950
 difficult in this case to indicate 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.760
 some days passed the week without entering 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.760
 in touch 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.819
 sometimes it works 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.730
 another situation that can happen 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.639
 You think but I have he did not call 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.910
 still but you're sure he wants 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.750
 that you look I 'm sure he 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.789
 Do you want me to feel it? 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.610
 very calm and just a touch 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.789
 Calm, this time it has TVs. 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.400
 yourself even if there is a 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.500
 expectation about the always better 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.020
 so I think you better have a 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.990
 little patience wait to send 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.660
 message end expects to see what he what 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.229
 He will give you feedback. 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.660
 another situation that can happen right is 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:57.160
 It's that business I work with. 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.840
 we will see this work the company very 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.610
 large and probably will not 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.740
 then find the message the message does 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.740
 everything we said now but if you 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.570
 will find you know that in the middle of the 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.449
 week you will come across the 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.539
 happened, how do you do it and I 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:17.680
 acts naturally now showing a 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.820
 A little more sympathy for him 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.130
 that before 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.750
 something that is not too much that does not give 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.620
 for people realized but that he 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.659
 realize hard you usually and in the sector 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.120
 his speaking of a past normal fact 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.550
 with him I admire the woman who knows 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.320
 to separate the emotional professional 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.080
 so if you act professionally 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.820
 normal and at the end give a little smile to 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.090
 it something that only he understands the 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.960
 message and password will love and 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.530
 ways that you can handle 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.120
 these situations in the river this the julia 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.000
 Today was it 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.060
 I hope I have helped the heart is 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.849
 helping you, I wanted to thank you 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.849
 You're here with us, so kiss.
