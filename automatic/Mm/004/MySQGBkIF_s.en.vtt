figure out how to give her a very long
time<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.559> figured<00:00:40.559> he<00:00:40.829> used<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.340> USB<00:00:41.820> stick<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
time I figured he used a USB stick and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.529 
time I figured he used a USB stick and
not<00:00:45.149> hacked<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.079> put<00:00:46.980> some<00:00:47.010> cheap<00:00:47.700> mud<00:00:48.180> things

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
on ps3 um because I don't think it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.819
