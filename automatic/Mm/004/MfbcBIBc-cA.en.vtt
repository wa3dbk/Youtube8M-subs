recommend<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:05.790> try<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.390> front<00:00:06.750> plate<00:00:07.020> raise

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
recommend you try the front plate raise

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.620 
recommend you try the front plate raise
with<00:00:07.560> rotation<00:00:08.220> now<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> execute<00:00:09.360> this

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
with rotation now to execute this

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.030 
with rotation now to execute this
movement<00:00:09.960> properly<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.380> want<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> begin<00:00:10.710> by

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
movement properly you want to begin by

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.419 
movement properly you want to begin by
engaging<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:12.570> front<00:00:12.870> delts<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.769> very<00:00:14.160> easy

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
engaging the front delts it's very easy

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.730 
engaging the front delts it's very easy
to<00:00:14.580> kind<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.820> use<00:00:14.969> momentum<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.870> supporting

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
to kind of use momentum and supporting

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.990 
to kind of use momentum and supporting
muscles<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> throw<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.580> weight<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:17.970> there

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
muscles to throw this weight up there

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
muscles to throw this weight up there
but<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.330> want<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.570> engage<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.020> front<00:00:19.680> delt

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
but you want to engage that front delt

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
but you want to engage that front delt
and<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.250> feel<00:00:20.609> them<00:00:20.730> squeeze<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.750> top

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and really feel them squeeze the top

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.019 
and really feel them squeeze the top
portion<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> movement<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.789> top

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
portion of the movement now at the top

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.900 
portion of the movement now at the top
it's<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.810> an<00:00:24.990> isometric<00:00:25.650> hold<00:00:25.949> there<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
it's like an isometric hold there so it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.759 
it's like an isometric hold there so it
really<00:00:26.939> makes<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:27.630> challenging<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.500> hold

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
really makes it very challenging to hold

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.080 
really makes it very challenging to hold
that<00:00:28.949> weight<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.429> there<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.730> you're<00:00:29.820> also

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that weight up there but you're also

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.600 
that weight up there but you're also
getting<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.750> rotation<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.250> gonna<00:00:32.369> kind

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
getting a rotation and it's gonna kind

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
getting a rotation and it's gonna kind
of<00:00:32.700> shift<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> emphasis<00:00:33.270> where<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> tension

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
of shift the emphasis where the tension

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.190 
of shift the emphasis where the tension
is<00:00:34.920> placed<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.880> your<00:00:35.969> delts<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.450> both<00:00:36.809> front

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is placed on your delts on both front

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.630 
is placed on your delts on both front
delts<00:00:37.590> there<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.890> you're<00:00:38.010> gonna<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> little

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
delts there so you're gonna get a little

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.389 
delts there so you're gonna get a little
bit<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.850> medial<00:00:39.180> delt<00:00:39.480> lateral<00:00:39.840> delt<00:00:40.399> coming

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
bit of medial delt lateral delt coming

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.670 
bit of medial delt lateral delt coming
into<00:00:41.550> play<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:42.260> control<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> movement

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
into play there control the movement

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.290 
into play there control the movement
really<00:00:43.829> feel<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> tension<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> way<00:00:45.120> down

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
really feel the tension on the way down

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.459 
really feel the tension on the way down
control<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> way<00:00:46.079> down

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
control on the way down

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.560 
control on the way down
notice<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:46.980> I'm<00:00:47.190> holding<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> plate<00:00:47.879> not

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
notice how I'm holding the plate not

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
notice how I'm holding the plate not
quite<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> middle<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.770> bit

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
quite in the middle it's a little bit

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.549 
quite in the middle it's a little bit
towards<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.969> bottom<00:00:51.270> portion<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> plate

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
towards the bottom portion of the plate

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.770 
towards the bottom portion of the plate
a<00:00:52.969> very<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.449> challenging<00:00:55.160> exercise<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
a very very challenging exercise and

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.380 
a very very challenging exercise and
here's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.320> variation<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.460> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
here's a variation if kind of like

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.599 
here's a variation if kind of like
plates<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> five<00:01:01.680> pounders<00:01:02.219> ten

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
plates you have the five pounders ten

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.350 
plates you have the five pounders ten
pounders<00:01:03.090> 25<00:01:03.660> 35<00:01:04.170> 45<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.670> between

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pounders 25 35 45 if you're in between

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.289 
pounders 25 35 45 if you're in between
using<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.409> dumbbell<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.460> helpful<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.060> here

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
using a dumbbell is very helpful so here

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.960 
using a dumbbell is very helpful so here
I<00:01:09.330> was<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> began<00:01:10.140> by<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> holding<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
I was a began by kind of holding the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
I was a began by kind of holding the
front<00:01:12.240> portion<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> dumbbell<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.500> I'm

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
front portion of the dumbbell now I'm

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
front portion of the dumbbell now I'm
holding<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.490> back<00:01:15.090> portion<00:01:15.450> which<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.439> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
holding the back portion which kind of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.090 
holding the back portion which kind of
shifts<00:01:16.950> where<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> load<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.909> placed<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
shifts where the load is placed here I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.999 
shifts where the load is placed here I
prefer<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.729> grip<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.990> easier<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.860> get

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
prefer this grip here it's easier to get

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460 
prefer this grip here it's easier to get
a<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.100> twist<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.140> makes<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a good twist in there but it makes the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.960 
a good twist in there but it makes the
exercise<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.220> challenging

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
exercise a little bit more challenging

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
exercise a little bit more challenging
but<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.479> using<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.110> dumbbell<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.710> great

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
but this is using a dumbbell is great

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.640 
but this is using a dumbbell is great
for<00:01:29.280> those<00:01:29.400> in-between<00:01:29.700> weights<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.900> say<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
for those in-between weights so say you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.969 
for those in-between weights so say you
can<00:01:31.950> only<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.280> 20<00:01:32.790> pounds<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.590> 40

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
can only do 20 pounds or you can do 40

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
can only do 20 pounds or you can do 40
pounds<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> dumbbell<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.960> between

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
pounds use a dumbbell that's in between

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.980 
pounds use a dumbbell that's in between
there<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:38.040> makes<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.610> very<00:01:38.670> challenging

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
there really makes it very challenging

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
there really makes it very challenging
same<00:01:39.990> movement<00:01:40.530> begin<00:01:41.100> by<00:01:41.250> engaging<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
same movement begin by engaging the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.929 
same movement begin by engaging the
front<00:01:42.780> delt<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.610> great<00:01:44.759> for

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
front delt this is really great for

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.490 
front delt this is really great for
bringing<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.299> those<00:01:45.509> shoulder<00:01:45.930> striations

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
bringing out those shoulder striations
