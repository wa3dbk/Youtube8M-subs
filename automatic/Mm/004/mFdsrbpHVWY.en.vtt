put<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.800> on<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.040> rip<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:53.010> read<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.040> book

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
put it on this rip now I read a book

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.149 
put it on this rip now I read a book
years<00:01:56.229> ago<00:01:56.470> called<00:01:57.159> into<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.760> wild<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> guy

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
years ago called into the wild but a guy

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.950 
years ago called into the wild but a guy
that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.870 

went<00:02:03.560> off<00:02:03.710> into<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.979> wild<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.400> live<00:02:04.580> off<00:02:04.729> the

went off into the wild to live off the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.070 
went off into the wild to live off the
land<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:06.500> he<00:02:06.680> ended<00:02:06.860> up<00:02:06.979> dying<00:02:08.709> and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
land and he ended up dying and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.620 
land and he ended up dying and
apparently<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.200> was<00:02:12.319> because<00:02:12.620> he<00:02:12.770> ate<00:02:13.630> potato

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
apparently it was because he ate potato

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.699 
apparently it was because he ate potato
seeds

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
seeds

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.059 
seeds
and<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.459> must<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.849> got<00:02:18.030> them<00:02:18.120> from

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
and they must have got them from

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.460 
and they must have got them from
odds<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:19.939> this<00:02:21.549> as<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:22.790> see

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
odds like this as you can see

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.540 
odds like this as you can see
your<00:02:24.920> seeds<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.400> there

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.530 

view<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:30.640> anyway

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
view of it but anyway

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.990 
view of it but anyway
he<00:02:33.079> ate<00:02:33.260> those<00:02:33.469> and<00:02:33.769> he<00:02:33.860> died<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.579> result

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
he ate those and he died as a result

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.209 
he ate those and he died as a result
it's<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.049> good<00:02:36.200> book<00:02:36.379> was<00:02:36.650> called<00:02:36.890> into<00:02:37.069> the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:37.219 
it's a good book was called into the

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:38.979 
it's a good book was called into the
wild<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:37.969> ever<00:02:38.090> get<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.239> chance<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.599> read<00:02:38.810> that

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
wild you ever get a chance to read that

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.750 
wild you ever get a chance to read that
it's<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.379> good<00:02:39.530> read<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:42.709> apparently<00:02:43.549> that's

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
it's a good read but apparently that's

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.660 
it's a good read but apparently that's
why<00:02:44.689> he<00:02:44.810> died<00:02:44.989> was<00:02:45.260> because<00:02:45.560> he<00:02:45.680> ate

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
why he died was because he ate

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.850 
why he died was because he ate
these<00:02:47.790> things<00:02:48.349> but<00:02:49.349> as<00:02:49.440> far<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.800> know

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
these things but as far as I know

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.580 
these things but as far as I know
they're<00:02:50.099> potato<00:02:50.400> seed<00:02:50.670> pods<00:02:51.200> they<00:02:52.200> don't<00:02:52.380> seem

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
they're potato seed pods they don't seem

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.210 
they're potato seed pods they don't seem
to<00:02:52.739> grow<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.250> potatoes

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.920 

don't<00:02:56.850> know<00:02:56.940> why<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.950> don't<00:02:58.950> eat<00:02:59.100> them

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
don't know why but don't eat them
