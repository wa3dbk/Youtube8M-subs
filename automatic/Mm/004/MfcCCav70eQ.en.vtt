00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
it's the engine bay of the estart before

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.680 
it's the engine bay of the estart before
that<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.400> had<00:00:11.550> removed<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.059> engine<00:00:12.210> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
that we had removed the engine and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.310 
that we had removed the engine and
rebuilt<00:00:14.299> what<00:00:15.299> happened<00:00:15.660> here<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
rebuilt what happened here was the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.140 
rebuilt what happened here was the
engine<00:00:17.060> overheated<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.740> it<00:00:19.740> pushed<00:00:20.150> water

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
engine overheated and it pushed water

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.550 
engine overheated and it pushed water
with<00:00:21.689> oil<00:00:22.039> into<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.420> heater<00:00:24.420> core<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.080> this

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
with oil into the heater core and this

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.060 
with oil into the heater core and this
is<00:00:25.680> 14<00:00:26.070> meter<00:00:27.000> cord<00:00:27.359> lines<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.890> can

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
is 14 meter cord lines are but you can

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.889 
is 14 meter cord lines are but you can
see<00:00:30.590> there<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.890> oil<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.610> water<00:00:33.180> that's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
see there is a oil and water that's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.430 
see there is a oil and water that's
mixed<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.920> both<00:00:35.820> side<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.260> see

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
mixed in this on both side you can see

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.510 
mixed in this on both side you can see
them<00:00:39.079> we<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> replace<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.250> out

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
them we are going to replace this out

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.200 
them we are going to replace this out
heater<00:00:41.910> core<00:00:42.469> hoses<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.670> inlet<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
heater core hoses also the inlet and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.279 
heater core hoses also the inlet and
outlet<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> reason

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
outlet of this and this is the reason

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.420 
outlet of this and this is the reason
why<00:00:49.500> jack<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:51.140> replacing<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.170> heater<00:00:52.739> core<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
why jack is replacing the heater core of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.410 
why jack is replacing the heater core of
this<00:00:54.149> vehicle<00:00:55.250> because<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.760> full<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> junk

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
this vehicle because it's full of junk

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.380 
this vehicle because it's full of junk
and<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.719> gonca<00:01:01.190> squirted<00:01:02.190> out

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
and you know like gonca squirted out

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.420 
and you know like gonca squirted out
into<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> windshield<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.040> vehicle

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
into the windshield of this vehicle

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.330 
into the windshield of this vehicle
always<00:01:08.430> found<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.390> srt<00:01:10.170> course<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
always found in srt course and this is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.990 
always found in srt course and this is
like<00:01:11.640> probably<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> 14th<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:14.939> 15th

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
like probably like the 14th or 15th

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.399 
like probably like the 14th or 15th
engine<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.320> had<00:01:16.439> rebuilt<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:17.820> noticed

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
engine that we had rebuilt we noticed

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.080 
engine that we had rebuilt we noticed
something<00:01:19.409> very<00:01:19.650> peculiar<00:01:20.520> about<00:01:20.790> this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
something very peculiar about this

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.640 
something very peculiar about this
engine<00:01:21.740> number<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.750> exhaust

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
engine number one is the exhaust

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.929 
engine number one is the exhaust
manifold<00:01:26.340> where<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.970> turbo<00:01:27.720> bolts<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.950> will

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
manifold where the turbo bolts in I will

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
manifold where the turbo bolts in I will
show<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.500> something<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
show you this this is something that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.960 
show you this this is something that
Mopar<00:01:32.850> probably<00:01:33.270> has<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.750> address<00:01:34.610> as<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.820> can

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
Mopar probably has to address as you can

it's junk it's basically has almost the
similar<00:02:30.200> problem<00:02:30.890> having<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.940> cracked

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
similar problem having a cracked

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.589 
similar problem having a cracked
manifold<00:02:32.720> like<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:35.300> know<00:02:35.450> with

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
manifold like this and you know with

manifold like this and you know with
this<00:02:35.720> video<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.080> hope<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.830> Mopar<00:02:37.400> might<00:02:37.760> see

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
this video I hope that Mopar might see

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.490 
this video I hope that Mopar might see
this<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.920> might<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.250> address<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.880> and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
this and might have to address this and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.380 
this and might have to address this and
put<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> technical<00:02:43.069> bulletin<00:02:43.489> on<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.760> if<00:02:44.150> they

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
put a technical bulletin on it if they

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.680 
put a technical bulletin on it if they
don't<00:02:44.569> if<00:02:44.989> they<00:02:45.319> don't<00:02:45.349> have<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.890> here<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:47.330> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
don't if they don't have it here so I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.050 
don't if they don't have it here so I
hope<00:02:48.349> this<00:02:48.530> add<00:02:48.739> this<00:02:48.950> would<00:02:49.130> also<00:02:49.370> help<00:02:49.549> you
