00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
kind of scary I thought is creative it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.389 
kind of scary I thought is creative it
kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> looks<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.170> playing<00:01:58.170> card<00:01:58.369> like<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
kind of looks like a playing card like a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
kind of looks like a playing card like a
deck<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> cards<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> looks<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
deck of cards and it looks like the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.039 
deck of cards and it looks like the
Queen<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.740> well<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.659> looks

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
Queen but well not really but it looks

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800 
Queen but well not really but it looks
like<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.969> set<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.149> Minecraft

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
like it would be on a set of Minecraft

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.590 
like it would be on a set of Minecraft
cards<00:02:07.320> playing<00:02:08.009> cards<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.640> had<00:02:08.819> them

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
cards playing cards if you had them

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.870 
cards playing cards if you had them
so<00:02:09.900> that's<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.260> skeleton<00:02:10.740> which<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.610> next

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
so that's the skeleton which the next

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.110 
so that's the skeleton which the next
one<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.270> herobrine<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.370> course<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.850> got<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
one is herobrine so of course you got to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.290 
one is herobrine so of course you got to
have<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.270> herobrine<00:02:15.780> flag<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.760> top<00:02:18.030> 10

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
have a herobrine flag in the top 10

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.400 
have a herobrine flag in the top 10
scariest<00:02:19.790> banners<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.570> here<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.260> mean

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
scariest banners and so here is I mean

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.050 
scariest banners and so here is I mean
he's<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.800> much<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.310> anything<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:23.910> two

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
he's not much of anything it's just two

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.010 
he's not much of anything it's just two
eyes<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.850> idea<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.600> those<00:02:27.990> are

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
eyes so the idea here is that those are

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.760 
eyes so the idea here is that those are
his<00:02:28.260> eyes

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
his eyes

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.030 
his eyes
so<00:02:28.890> there's<00:02:29.100> your<00:02:29.280> herobrine<00:02:29.970> flag<00:02:30.920> next<00:02:31.920> one

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so there's your herobrine flag next one

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.570 
so there's your herobrine flag next one
is<00:02:32.220> called<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.790> evil<00:02:33.270> bunny<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.920> if<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.400> want
