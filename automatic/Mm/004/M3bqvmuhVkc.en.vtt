00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:08.480
 well then having the 3 by 3 of 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.160
 here yellow and 3 by 13 and white 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.369
 so let's do any of the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.470
 the other four faces that remain 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:20.860
 as exactly as we have done 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.170
 for example, we start with the green face 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.720
 because we already have three pieces 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.310
 placed and we saved ourselves we skipped 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.900
 Down here 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.340
 Well, here we can do it with 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.380
 tranquility as if we had started 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.080
 the white face because we're just going to move 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.470
 these parts and we will not be able to see 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.010
 none of the two that we already have 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:45.090
 achieved well for example 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.100
 two green pieces the forms to your site 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.100
 and on this side a green piece 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.980
 and now we would just have to start 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.380
 do the same movements that we have 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.850
 done before to complete any of 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.730
 the other two faces 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.199
 we have a green piece here and we 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.199
 interesting to place here 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.010
 we put them in place rotate part 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.490
 superior we save the ones that we have put 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.380
 we throw top we recover what 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.710
 that we had moved and the top 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.410
 and we put it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 we only need 2 here we have another 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.100
 we repeat the same movement 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.939
 we put in its place we turn part 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.450
 superior salvamos recover part 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.380
 top we recover moved we go back to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.409
 the top to recover 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.049
 our rows completed well let's 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.850
 for the last the last one we have here 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 down 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.409
 we put it in the face that interests us 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.390
 and since we do not have anything else done now 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.460
 we recover what we have moved so as not 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.940
 lose nothing and we have it ready for 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.100
 cut then equal 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.590
 we look we look at how much higher we save 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.060
 we turn to top 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.640
 we recover by the top and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.610
 we recover skin 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.350
 we would already have one of the four faces 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.090
 remaining well the next 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.960
 I learned in these ways I'm going to 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.910
 teach and good video 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.370
 I think that's the most I really think it is 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.500
 the most comfortable thing is to do the opposite now 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.140
 to the green that would be the blue face well 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.800
 how do we do this as before 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.240
 exactly the same pieces here for 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.130
 place here 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.550
 turn 2 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.480
 and the top 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.150
 we saved 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.319
 we go back top we recover 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.840
 become top we recover no 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 we lose nothing of the green and we go 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.200
 completing the blue 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.380
 and so with all of that with all the pieces 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.260
 blue we have here 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.659
 we turn 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.909
 we put the piece where we are interested in 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.390
 go to your top we save the 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.540
 completed strips we come back with the part 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.030
 top we recover spin the aces 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.819
 top and we put of blue bishop 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.490
 that we have done exactly the same for 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.430
 the last is to always repeat the same 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.700
 we can 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.270
 on your site 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.270
 let's see 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.400
 we remember 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.620
 'We expect grams and turning out well already 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.950
 we have the two proposals well 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.810
 now to complete the last two years 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.849
 I explain it in the following video although 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.849
 the movements are the same but 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.500
 but I'll explain it in another video 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.960
 to select the entire tutorial a 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.860
 little bit more jazz and not doing it so 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.860
 so heavy
