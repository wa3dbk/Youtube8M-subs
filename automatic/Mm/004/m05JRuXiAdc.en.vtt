00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:18.789

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.310
 so we decided to make this exhibition 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.820
 in the month of the child 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.130
 rescuing this 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.620
 the art of producing with the mind without burning the souls of people 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 she 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.300
 the psd came from a job that I had that I needed to finalize which was a 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.360
 miniature dollhouse 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.150
 not everything that is small 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.309

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.870
 the matt taylor ward 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.990
 and I did not find in Brazil that same job 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.920
 So I went outside Brazil where I met 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.619
 in this work of dolls in 1993 and then I fell in love was started to do 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.390
 I studied and went outside the country. 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.720
 and it was from where I came bringing this technology, right? 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 this job 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.829
 besides of all kind of grandson that is the doll she is not thus 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.390
 the product that was the fatigue the child 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.400
 people come and she really delights 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.570
 by having socks with us every adult person has also had 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.640
 in the right moment 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.750
 the children are also in debt, we already had several men here who 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.190
 they came 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
 It's very cool to see people's reaction. 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.650
 afternoon comes on the table for after all who did we saw what is not difficult 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.600
 but it is very laborious 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.610
 porcelain comes liquid 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.940
 and from there was put in a new design furnas this way to manage this from there 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.509
 razed well paid in the marking 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:19.589
 and then goes out to the pharmacies this mass agent goes pro forma then only 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.129
 in the oven 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.949
 a piece I got about eight times 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.959
 chalk then tip during 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.170
 in all with a technique for you pain you get the changes 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:35.909
 of the makeup has some parts that the one I put kit has a gold are 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.889
 several details not even for you 'he told later is this character who are the 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.050
 clothes 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.050
 the sign puppets solar 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:58.089
 we have moments here in the exhibition ranging from 80 reais to 3,000 and 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.229
 five hundred 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:01.099
 huh 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.689
 price variation 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.909
 and also because of the work that went into 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.689
 we decided to make an average with the importance of the doll too 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.969
 and the situation will remain here until the 30th 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.739
 not even a person can come 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.639
 from Monday to Friday until 8 pm sic open house ne 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.669
 and not only on Saturdays until 2 pm 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.299
 the person can come can visit the case 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.109
 Since then he came and we wanted him right here. 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.109
 the medical ones 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.379
 cio follows the average and do with much harmony if it knows each piece is a piece 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.339
 it's unique 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.389
 who do we do sculptures permanently 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.779
 these products even affection 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:50.399
 I think if you have it then you really want the life that the character 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.289
 Nor do we aspire sometimes to get over
