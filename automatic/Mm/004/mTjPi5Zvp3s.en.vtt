00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.630
 there were people like we are in the pp we are 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.710
 here we are with a leasing machine 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:13.730
 and without boxer some 15,000 legendary a 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.990
 skin that will be worth 1150 repres 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.550
 because 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.550
 so let's see 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.699
 a bitch like this to facts of them 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.930
 it is impressive the way they have done 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.309
 up here very well made the truth 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.690
 animations is no longer a problem against 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.690
 a stinking enemy 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.150
 and today is not the day when you will achieve 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.150
 victory 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.120
 this in changed I think I dance 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.329
 no not in exchange yet this but 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.270
 changed surely happens here 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.560
 surely 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.020
 and then the laughter 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.700
 because it is completely the same so 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.700
 let's see the skills but 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.940
 the word is amazing to be here 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.970
 you are going to see because the truth is that it is 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.070
 a king who is finished yet but is 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.070
 that michael has driven me crazy 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 basically 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.360
 we have the curve of the q does not change anything 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.230
 basically another saying but it's cool 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.360
 washers 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.870
 if you notice every time we use the w 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.850
 makes the sound of the ring 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.100
 with the game acts simply for that 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.350
 I like it 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.159
 the beautiful bot 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.159
 again 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.930
 I do not know if they change something in the ass this 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.930
 on the q 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.840
 the constant equal the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.280
 to which also is not very sure 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.330
 then we have the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.170
 double and w 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 in this variable 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.380
 with the double w we have three genes of 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.090
 life as you know 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:36.030
 and then we have the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:40.380
 not much to use to read if I give it 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.010
 under everything it is better to be without being 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.010
 under tower 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.260
 Being here 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.960
 people 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.110
 wait patiently 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.080
 both points 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.190
 is that the net a gazelle well if not not 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.190
 will see week 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.939
 It would be a shit 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.930
 let's go vote fucking 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.390
 is 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.620
 well ferrer 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.250
 As you can see, the place is not shown 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.250
 that we arrived 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.459
 to this simple 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.360
 maybe it is not over yet as I say 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.360
 it's a beta phase 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.620
 And I do not know 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.170
 I guess more special effects I say 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.170
 me to be similar to a ball 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.690
 do not burn too much so nothing 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.690
 you will like it here
