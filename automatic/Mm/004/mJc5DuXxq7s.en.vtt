click<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.359> now<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.350> said<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.710> my

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
click on that now as I said in my

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
click on that now as I said in my
previous<00:01:02.039> video<00:01:02.579> normally<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
previous video normally what I do is I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.500 
previous video normally what I do is I
do<00:01:04.260> three<00:01:04.860> benchmarks<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.180> give<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
do three benchmarks and then I give you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.320 
do three benchmarks and then I give you
an<00:01:06.750> average<00:01:07.290> score<00:01:07.560> from<00:01:08.189> those<00:01:08.400> three<00:01:08.670> but

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
an average score from those three but

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240 
an average score from those three but
since<00:01:09.600> these<00:01:09.840> programs<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.799> necessarily

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
since these programs are not necessarily

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
since these programs are not necessarily
optimized<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.150> android<00:01:12.720> 4.0<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.740> ice<00:01:14.159> cream

sandwich<00:01:14.880> we're<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
sandwich we're just going to do the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
sandwich we're just going to do the
benchmarks<00:01:16.590> once<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.150> actually

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
benchmarks once now this one is actually

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
benchmarks once now this one is actually
a<00:01:18.960> portrait<00:01:19.770> app<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.400> I'm<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
a portrait app so I'm just going to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
a portrait app so I'm just going to
switch<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> way<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.159> basically<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.759> just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
switch it this way and basically it just

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
switch it this way and basically it just
gives<00:01:24.119> me<00:01:24.240> some<00:01:24.420> information<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.229> going

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
gives me some information here I'm going

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
gives me some information here I'm going
to<00:01:25.439> hit<00:01:25.500> OK<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
to hit OK and what I want to do is I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.010 
to hit OK and what I want to do is I
want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.470> run<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.159> full<00:01:29.570> benchmark<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.960> I'm

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
want to run the full benchmark so I'm

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
want to run the full benchmark so I'm
going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.200> click<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> says<00:01:32.130> run

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
going to click up here where it says run

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
going to click up here where it says run
full<00:01:32.759> benchmark<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:34.500> running<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.979> right

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
full benchmark and it's running it right

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
full benchmark and it's running it right
now<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.610> doing<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.850> CPU<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> doing

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
now it's doing the CPU now it's doing

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:52.649 
now it's doing the CPU now it's doing
the<00:01:37.200> memory<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> on

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.110 
with that and here we go let's bring
this<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.739> little<00:02:33.920> closer<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:34.910> see

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
this a little closer in so you can see

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:45.490 
this a little closer in so you can see
it<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.530> says<00:02:36.530> my<00:02:36.920> score<00:02:39.220> 2423<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> let's<00:02:45.319> move

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
it it says my score 2423 so let's move

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.729 
it it says my score 2423 so let's move
on<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.980> next<00:02:46.010> benchmark<00:02:46.819> here<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.739> that

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
on to the next benchmark here and that

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:57.430 
on to the next benchmark here and that
one<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.300> smart<00:02:50.300> bench<00:02:50.709> 2011<00:02:55.510> I'm<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.290> run

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
one is smart bench 2011 I'm going to run

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.580 
one is smart bench 2011 I'm going to run
smart<00:02:57.890> bench<00:02:58.450> and<00:03:00.069> it's<00:03:01.069> calculating<00:03:01.700> pi<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
smart bench and it's calculating pi and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.380 
smart bench and it's calculating pi and
again<00:03:06.590> with<00:03:06.769> this<00:03:06.920> one<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.190> have<00:03:07.519> some

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
again with this one you have some

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.330 
again with this one you have some
graphics<00:03:08.959> on<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:09.830> it's<00:03:09.980> going<00:03:10.069> to<00:03:10.130> run

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
graphics on this so it's going to run

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:31.510 
graphics on this so it's going to run
through<00:03:10.370> its<00:03:10.670> paces

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.260 

and<00:03:31.910> it's<00:03:32.450> complete<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:34.190> let's<00:03:34.400> display<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
and it's complete so let's display the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.310 
and it's complete so let's display the
index<00:03:35.600> scores<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:39.070> here<00:03:40.070> we<00:03:40.160> go<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:41.320> the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
index scores and here we go on the

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.450 
index scores and here we go on the
productivity<00:03:43.130> index<00:03:43.370> my<00:03:44.210> score<00:03:44.660> was<00:03:46.870> 3394<00:03:47.870> on

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
productivity index my score was 3394 on

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.440 
productivity index my score was 3394 on
the<00:03:49.460> game's<00:03:49.760> index<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:51.050> score<00:03:51.470> was<00:03:53.530> 2493<00:03:54.530> and

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
the game's index the score was 2493 and

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.660 
the game's index the score was 2493 and
again<00:03:56.450> this<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.720> running<00:03:57.050> android<00:03:57.530> 4.0<00:03:58.190> and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
again this is running android 4.0 and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.980 
again this is running android 4.0 and
it's<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.480> stock<00:03:59.780> rom<00:04:00.400> let's<00:04:01.400> go<00:04:01.640> back<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.210> do

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
it's the stock rom let's go back and do

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:12.240 
it's the stock rom let's go back and do
another<00:04:03.290> benchmark<00:04:04.070> here<00:04:04.610> which<00:04:04.790> is<00:04:05.030> an<00:04:05.270> 22

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.590 

and<00:04:13.250> I'm<00:04:13.400> going<00:04:13.520> to<00:04:13.550> click<00:04:13.790> test<00:04:14.210> right<00:04:14.570> here

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
and I'm going to click test right here

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.830 
and I'm going to click test right here
and<00:04:15.670> start<00:04:16.670> test<00:04:16.970> down<00:04:17.239> here<00:04:19.299> it's<00:04:20.299> testing

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
and start test down here it's testing

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.730 
and start test down here it's testing
the<00:04:21.020> CPU<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.860> memory<00:04:21.920> right<00:04:22.640> now<00:04:23.530> now<00:04:24.530> it's

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
the CPU and memory right now now it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:37.990 
the CPU and memory right now now it's
testing<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.750> 2d<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.020> 3d<00:04:28.240> OpenGL<00:04:29.240> here

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000 

and<00:04:38.120> those<00:04:38.750> are<00:04:38.930> little<00:04:39.020> androids<00:04:39.650> on

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
and those are little androids on

00:04:40.010 --> 00:05:11.839 
and those are little androids on
skateboards

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.389 

and<00:05:12.270> here<00:05:12.689> we<00:05:12.719> go<00:05:12.809> with<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.259> Knights<00:05:13.499> slashing

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:14.399 
and here we go with the Knights slashing

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:17.899 
and here we go with the Knights slashing
their<00:05:14.550> swords<00:05:15.029> and<00:05:15.919> it's<00:05:16.919> testing<00:05:17.399> the<00:05:17.550> frames

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909

are the scores let me bring this in a

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.020 
are the scores let me bring this in a
little<00:05:46.560> closer<00:05:46.770> so<00:05:46.950> you<00:05:47.160> can<00:05:47.250> actually<00:05:47.460> see<00:05:47.670> it

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
little closer so you can actually see it

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.610 
little closer so you can actually see it
for<00:05:48.210> yourself<00:05:48.600> but<00:05:49.590> I<00:05:49.650> will<00:05:49.950> read<00:05:50.190> them<00:05:50.370> off

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
for yourself but I will read them off

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.310 
for yourself but I will read them off
