00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.610
 very good sisters that such stage follow 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.049
 be welcome to the channel and welcome 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.430
 a new video until I bring a video 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.379
 important and very informative and is the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.029
 schedule about the new season of 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.560
 channel and as you know I already said on twitter 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.480
 a couple of days ago everyone is the world 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 idea and I said that I was just going to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.720
 start this new week you for the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.490
 channel had thought will start on Friday what 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.440
 what's up that says good look we're already 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.600
 to tuesday and it's not called fancy start 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.800
 with the things more and such and to what I 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.990
 I mean with a good season like 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.449
 You see, I'm going to change this week to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 leave absolutely everything all everything 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.140
 everything I'm going to change in a way 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 make everything much nicer very much 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.949
 better and such everything is going to be like a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.449
 little bit is not going away it's as much as a 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.100
 a little more uniform, four 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.530
 designs and such of miniatures and all this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.059
 it's going to be pretty uniform and such and I'm going to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.929
 follow a schedule thing that I've never 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.309
 done because every time I made a 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.049
 schedule so I do not know then I felt lazy 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.339
 follow what they are like that always followed 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.960
 but well finally I made a schedule 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.319
 which I think is pretty good is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.670
 quite correct and as is a 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.780
 video which we are at a schedule of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 which I think is pretty good because 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 I already told you guys that you were not I wanted to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.650
 focus on completing which 100% in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 complete and immerse myself in the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100
 competitive and fit so to speak 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.320
 improve the competitive did not occur 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.990
 I do not know what not but pussy at least 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 it would weaken me to be able to say pussy and the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 competitive game even if it's not good 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 but at least know that you're 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.530
 little things get me to fill the competitive 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.940
 and such that the schedule has been the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 next as I'm going to put you in 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.470
 screen and nothing as you see can go up 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.390
 two videos during the week and ask for them 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.190
 week I'm going to go up three eye that I'm going to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.630
 go up two and three and for example in the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.670
 if they are breaking news 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.350
 in plan I know that one comes out 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.060
 information or something like that well now 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.950
 there will be more videos and they are not scheduled 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.830
 obviously as soon as it comes out I upload ballet 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.179
 and in the case that for example that you 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.890
 I can say I want to make a 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.289
 streaming for anything 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.280
 would basically go the same thing as 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.080
 you see the schedule has been left of the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.759
 next way during the week that is 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.159
 Monday through Friday at three o'clock 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.050
 late nothing since it is a time that is very 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.020
 soon and then well you are a 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.520
 bit weird that there was because 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.710
 barely gives me time digital raid 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.810
 to record it so nothing after the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.179
 six we have during the week we have with 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.100
 times wifi and then we have Saturdays 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.330
 well I said wifi that let me you 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.000
 explain they can be against you 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.530
 It can be done by spots 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 It can be me that I know 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.250
 thousands of ways to eat and wifi tes 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.959
 even some in saud even because no 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.060
 but we're going mainly to be in 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.770
 blond mega is worth it because it is not I want 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.420
 as digital after that the guys 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.060
 we stop tutorial a musician guide 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.620
 that you imagine a guide how to create 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.569
 so to speak I do not think I make it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 at the moment because I do not know how to raise but what 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.569
 that we imagine that I learn italy and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.489
 because I would be going to look me in April 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.319
 a guide how to raise then that for 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.940
 example at Christmas, because there I would put it 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.530
 after Sunday an online meeting 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 and every week and also now that 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.250
 I'm participating in a competition of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.470
 catch pokémons haining so good 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.030
 I guess I'll get something out of pokémon 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.920
 saint and so Sunday is going to be the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.239
 day in which I teach you possibly if 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.690
 You take me out more than one dream a week 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.519
 so bring us to make it a video with 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.019
 several vouchers I'm not going to go into 18 and 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.790
 is for Indian house depends the same does 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.440
 illusion and does not depend a little on 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.860
 saint and dragon way to appear in team 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.480
 then guys we have at ten and 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.950
 average of the night if a little late what 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.540
 they separate from Spain but I think neither 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.340
 It's so late, well, well, I think 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.930
 that is pretty good we do not have monday 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.730
 Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday at 10 and I 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.760
 give a series in this case it would be pokemon 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.100
 hike in a blog is worth it and I think 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.140
 that two is a yes that is pretty good 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.760
 I'll try to give a little more than 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.410
 emotion especially for upcoming videos 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.030
 but good after Friday we have the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.950
 hunting of the same and live since already 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.750
 you know chained fishing I guess I'll do 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.209
 or some more entertaining method like that 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.530
 because yesterday's thing that was resetting us 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.910
 mocks everyone and also I've already taken 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.769
 hobby the trick for fishing 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.390
 chained and usually I usually be in 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.489
 saint is that I will do the hunt for the semi in 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.950

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.180
 I'm uploading the series that I'll touch 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.470
 well you know in this case this strip the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.480
 pharming blog but once finished 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.790
 this series then another series any 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.010
 ok and then on Sunday to this same 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.480
 hour we have a tutorial a guide that 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.700
 good that can be replaced by 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.170
 example by streaming in plan 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.970
 making me super secret base by 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.190
 example that we stay there halfway 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.770
 and it's going to be Friday so there they are 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.780
 things after the 3 guys we have 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.620
 video on Saturday and Sunday that good 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.870
 Saturday at 3 o'clock we will have efe a mister 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.609
 gaming against good subscribers against 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.230
 subscribers nou also against geri 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.239
 because they are all against all the 2 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.370
 against all as subs you already know yours 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.810
 opportunity to leave the channel if not 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.820
 You have seen the video and are looking for 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.500
 channel because really that's a great 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.880
 way that you can in the channel and 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.710
 then on Sunday we have that line 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.410
 week that is already a draw for a pokémon 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.910
 shiny so nothing at three also 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.440
 good stationary that I have been left 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.940
 I do not know if you will like me the truth that 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.130
 I like it quite well I have taken some 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.200
 hours so to speak in which not 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.850
 Many people survived at six o'clock 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.130
 ten and a half viability I think that never 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.240
 I have uploaded video but well I think that 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.980
 it's a truth that is pretty good 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.450
 especially for the Latin American people and 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.000
 the people of Spain so you can see the day 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.140
 next when returning from class or without more 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.580
 you can see it more than engineering that 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.440
 neither is it a time that is too late 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.150
 so you guys did not like the video 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.710
 that has left a like and a favorites 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.480
 remember that the goal for study 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.880
 they are 500 lake and see you in the next 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.050
 video the channel so until the next 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.050
 and so much 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.420
 now
