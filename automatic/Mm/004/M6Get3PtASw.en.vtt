 Yeah it Is pleased to introduce today 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.040
 by signal without indicator without win 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:19.100
 It is yr scan blinker system 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.020
 8 Here's a big thing It's such an oval very compact when combined 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.300
 It becomes size, but 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.220
 That blinker can be divided into students before and after 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.300
 Is it you that well before and after 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.370
 8 here has become so 8 is just attached to the underside of the saddle 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 In it is here is is larger here Nee 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.060
 It's 8 lights and it's a matter of saying it's a winker 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.360
 Just the handle of that handle 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.810
 I 'm trying to attach that to you 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.270
 In Is is a video Netto Well complete recovery 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.180
 Is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.650
 Carbonate is here 4 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.730
 is not it 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:06.380
 Yes Well it is yes After you have entered this way 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:12.230
 Here it is I hey AAA guess here is also single 4 4 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.330
 At 8 power sources you have to put each one, but this red button 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:22.190
 Well, if you push this 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:24.050
 This blinking or with the anti-I is when the flashes that once in also here put it is in the same way great 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.470
 The power is on at 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.470
 Yes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.090
 It is a video 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.890
 It button of that Wynn car is It is the red part this is the button of that win car 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.820
 Become 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.820
 In the I First yeah it is this Order from who I am right 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.640
 This is true though 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.490
 It will be linked back and forth, so pressing it again will cancel you 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.460
 The left is the same 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.460
 Works in this way yes 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:11.440
 It's a front light I think it's a light LED light but 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.440
 If you push the button behind this once, this is the lighting state first of all 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:20.960
 Because it's dazzling if you hit it directly 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.960
 It flashes when you press it sideways 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 It will be off by now if you do it again 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.340
 Yes it does not work me in this 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:40.550
 It is a turnover and once it is in the same way it is also towards the back 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.550
 If you do it again, it will blink again and it will be called strikeoff Yes 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.310
 It's attached but it's 8 front too 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.540
 About the front blinker 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.610
 Well , it 's on that super- handled post 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.670
 That 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.970
 It's like this I hope you have fixed it 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.290
 It is with it that comes is Well hexagon 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.209
 That hex wrench comes with just behind this reflector 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.620
 Since that hex wrench that allows the developer to that contained just removed from that compartment 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.690
 That 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:26.080
 It will be just the way that get installed in the middle It is this handle NiÃ±o this 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.960
 The installation of the blinker itself is here . 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.330
 It contains 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:36.910
 It is time to remove it 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:40.930
 Yes it exits to slip and I'll just to defeat the bell a little before 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.500
 It is a turn signal stay behind , yes this is it 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.180
 Just 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.290
 In this way, it is attached to the pipe under the saddle 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.330
 It is a hexagonal wrench of this is also I that included 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:03.390
 That is supposed to be closed Yes 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:03.390
 Only I am plugged in the same way Edo I front Oriental is also here for You're mounting 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:13.590
 You can fix it in this way, and this Belo again 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.680
 Can be easily removed if you knock down 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.600
 Yes 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.389
 Toka You're that Toka theft when away from the Well of the bicycle 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.580
 It is for the prevention that you have you remove that voice easily to that voice 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.420
 8 Yeah it is an accessory 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.900
 Such a thing 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.550
 Case comes with 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.249
 For example it is in this case 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.860
 Well with that blinker in this way 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.620
 I hope you can store it. 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.610
 Well with a bag 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.480
 I think that I can end up in such a place , yes 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.510
 It looks like this 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.610
 It is later as a note 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:07.510
 Because it is such a product that is driven by that battery by all means during the winter 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:11.470
 Because there are some parts that are weak to weather and weather resistance and also slightly a little 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.500
 Even if you are riding on the previous life with that condition 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.860
 You 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:20.390
 Had you still check Toka state of that over-the-counter state behind it is the Toka signal waiting in between 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.490
 I think it is better 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:27.200
 After all, when the battery becomes weak, the interlocking of the wireless is not that 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.610
 Because there is also a case 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.300
 8 I think if you can pay that attention as much as possible 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.240
 Yes 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:42.699
 It is later because it is import goods yeah 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.350
 I've been into the blister pack but than you Yes and that opened for operation confirmation 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.770
 What 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:52.220
 Please note 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.220
