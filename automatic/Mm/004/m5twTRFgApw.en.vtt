and<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.300> happened<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.110> earthquake<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and what happened in this earthquake is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
and what happened in this earthquake is
see<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.640> well<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> fit<00:00:48.570> into<00:00:48.750> their

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
see how well we have to fit into their

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
see how well we have to fit into their
indeed<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.129> course<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.489> problem<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
indeed of course the problem is not that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
indeed of course the problem is not that
we<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> approach<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
we have to approach now it's the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770 
we have to approach now it's the
buildings<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.820> before<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.600> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
buildings that we go before we make it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.229 
buildings that we go before we make it
so<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.620> guess<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.219> problem<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.730> type<00:00:56.969> food

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
so my guess is a problem in type food

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.610 
so my guess is a problem in type food
agreement<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.109> will<00:00:58.289> could<00:00:58.440> say<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
agreement we will could say that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.709 
agreement we will could say that
community<00:00:59.399> areas<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.030> buildings<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> will

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
community areas of buildings and will

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.799 
community areas of buildings and will
not<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.930> welcome<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.590> hips<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.390> engineers

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
not be welcome your hips so engineers

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.390 
not be welcome your hips so engineers
will<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> been<00:01:04.769> feeling<00:01:05.159> very

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
critically understand how we can to find

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.429
