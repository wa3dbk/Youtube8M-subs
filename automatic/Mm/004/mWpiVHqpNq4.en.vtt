00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.639
 Hello dear friends immediately 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.130
 The main theme channel for today's 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.840
 lesson chose the patch 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.670
 quite often there are such problems 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.000
 myself 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:32.660
 post when the skin is torn by 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.560
 league equality not to the bottom most often 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.510
 it comes from the fact that people 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.710
 rarely cares for her 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.390
 shoes or do not forgive cream these places 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.970
 we are always sometimes under the skin and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.150
 There are many problems as reasons 1 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.989
 and here with this problem which today 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.989
 we will try 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.830
 We start with the fact that using a screwdriver 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:14.480
 road rounded edges no island place 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.960
 we tear off a sole that's on top of about 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.960
 so here 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.340
 such movements just add up 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.850
 the sole 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.009
 here we are going to need her 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.380
 exfoliate more than the zoo itself 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.880
 and do not be afraid to tear more 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.369
 because the more to give those 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.729
 it will be more convenient to patch those 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.700
 better put do not worry 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.700
 if u do not try to make a close 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.130
 it's inconvenient 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.760
 for the separation will continue as I do not like 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.670
 I don't like the heater even when 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:11.450
 heat the sole given let's say 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.540
 composed of primer and sole rand 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.790
 peel off then it will be possible 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.570
 suffer to plant on the local will be seen 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.850
 what will be the intervention when the sole 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.000
 flies yes there so everything is just there you can 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 heat up 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 either on the trainer or with the help of a hair dryer 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.700
 there are many ways 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.120
 but the meaning remains the same 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.120
 from heating glue 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:54.770
 easier and your analysis of the fight at times 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.770
 flattened 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.720
 tore off fire 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:13.920
 up now take out you see 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.920
 our only 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.730
 here we will put the patches so 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.230
 we pulled off came 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:35.670
 rejected the shoe now we need to master 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:38.090
 under such a knife up here we will do 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.090
 So 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:01.269
 cut out the very patch of fish pieces of skin 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:06.340
 trim that is for the folder should 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:09.970
 block our hole at least on 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.970
 centimeters and a half 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.579
 up to this centimeter two two and a half 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.479
 wide 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.479
 we cut the ribbon 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:28.800
 round off edges 2 live like this 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.920
 here look see the patch 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.920
 how much more than herself 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.409
 Now 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:52.640
 Bruce a layer of edge direct so that they do not 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.640
 stood out when all these get together 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.300
 Now I am loafing our flour 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.300
 glue 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.510
 then let it dry 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.190
 let's not start directly 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.190
 installations
