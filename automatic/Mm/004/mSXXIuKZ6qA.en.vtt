00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
of personality level II didn't know the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.960 
of personality level II didn't know the
answer<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.200> didn't<00:05:09.010> know<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.370> felt<00:05:09.670> that

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
answer I didn't know and I felt that

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.700 
answer I didn't know and I felt that
it's<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.390> bit<00:05:10.510> of<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:10.660> poser<00:05:10.900> though<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.320> know<00:05:11.470> yeah

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
it's a bit of a poser though I know yeah

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.190 
it's a bit of a poser though I know yeah
but<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.280> think<00:05:12.580> after<00:05:13.300> 40<00:05:13.690> years<00:05:13.720> of<00:05:14.020> it

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
but you think after 40 years of it

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.720 
but you think after 40 years of it
there'd<00:05:14.440> be<00:05:14.590> some<00:05:14.890> kind<00:05:15.070> of<00:05:15.100> guidelines<00:05:15.310> for

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
there'd be some kind of guidelines for

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.240 
there'd be some kind of guidelines for
these<00:05:15.850> things<00:05:16.260> yeah<00:05:17.260> I<00:05:17.530> mean<00:05:17.830> perhaps<00:05:18.100> that

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
these things yeah I mean perhaps that

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.770 
these things yeah I mean perhaps that
was<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.460> first<00:05:18.700> time<00:05:18.880> anyone<00:05:19.210> thought<00:05:19.570> of

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
was the first time anyone thought of

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.800 
was the first time anyone thought of
putting<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.140> solver<00:05:20.560> Brummie<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.180> Doctor<00:05:22.780> Who

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
putting a solver Brummie is a Doctor Who

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.140 
putting a solver Brummie is a Doctor Who
you
