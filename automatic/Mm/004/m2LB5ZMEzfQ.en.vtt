00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that yeah actually this might be a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
that yeah actually this might be a
little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.120> closer<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.480> what<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> fall

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
little bit closer than what I fall

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.940 
little bit closer than what I fall
because<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> move<00:01:21.450> right<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.950> it's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
because of that move right there it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
because of that move right there it's
not<00:01:23.100> exactly<00:01:23.579> range<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.420> it'll<00:01:25.320> do

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
not exactly range but it's it'll do

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
not exactly range but it's it'll do
that's<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.130> sure<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.729> he's<00:01:27.329> got<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.600> he's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's for sure and he's got that he's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.350
