00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
itself but the cable that came with your

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.530 
itself but the cable that came with your
Samsung<00:01:09.869> Galaxy<00:01:09.900> s3<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:11.369> also<00:01:11.729> work<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.240> sync

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
Samsung Galaxy s3 will also work to sync

Samsung Galaxy s3 will also work to sync
and<00:01:12.750> charge<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.350> battery<00:01:13.590> case<00:01:14.100> now

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and charge this battery case now

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
and charge this battery case now
basically<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.840> kind<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.350> nice<00:01:16.650> soft

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
basically this is kind of a nice soft

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.450 
basically this is kind of a nice soft
silicone<00:01:17.759> case<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> battery<00:01:19.350> built<00:01:20.070> into

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
silicone case with a battery built into

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
silicone case with a battery built into
the<00:01:20.580> back<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.259> does<00:01:22.500> add<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the back as you can see here does add a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.490 
the back as you can see here does add a
little<00:01:22.890> bit<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> thickness<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.060> s3<00:01:24.500> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
little bit of thickness to your s3 but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.230 
little bit of thickness to your s3 but
it<00:01:25.650> gives<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.009> fifteen<00:01:26.549> hundred<00:01:26.850> million

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
it gives you fifteen hundred million

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
it gives you fifteen hundred million
powers<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.780> basically<00:01:28.350> I've<00:01:28.470> tested<00:01:28.920> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
powers so basically I've tested this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
powers so basically I've tested this
about<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.610> four<00:01:29.729> times<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.960> will

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
about three or four times and it will

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.080 
about three or four times and it will
give<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.530> basically<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> chargeback<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
give you basically a chargeback of

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.200 
give you basically a chargeback of
anywhere<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:33.689> fifty<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> sixty<00:01:35.100> percent<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
anywhere from fifty to sixty percent so

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
anywhere from fifty to sixty percent so
in<00:01:36.299> other<00:01:36.360> words<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> run<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.470> Galaxy<00:01:38.340> s3

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
in other words if you run your Galaxy s3

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
in other words if you run your Galaxy s3
down<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.390> twenty<00:01:39.750> percent<00:01:40.140> turn<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
down to about twenty percent turn this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
down to about twenty percent turn this
battery<00:01:41.220> case<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.729> you'll<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.150> somewhere

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
battery case on you'll be somewhere

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.120 
battery case on you'll be somewhere
between<00:01:42.780> seventy<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.530> eighty<00:01:43.829> percent

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
between seventy and eighty percent

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.760 
between seventy and eighty percent
charge<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:45.899> pretty<00:01:46.229> good<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> will

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
charge so that's pretty good and will

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.380 
charge so that's pretty good and will
