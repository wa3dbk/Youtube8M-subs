this<00:02:51.500> question<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.129> connected<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> my

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
this question is connected to my

this question is connected to my
previous<00:02:53.299> answer<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:54.019> didn't<00:02:54.349> put<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.709> battle

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
previous answer we didn't put the battle

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.740 
previous answer we didn't put the battle
frontier<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.519> auras<00:02:55.819> for<00:02:56.030> this<00:02:56.180> very<00:02:56.420> reason

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
frontier in auras for this very reason

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.369 
frontier in auras for this very reason
and<00:02:57.140> quote<00:02:58.239> what<00:02:59.239> this<00:02:59.390> means<00:02:59.659> is<00:02:59.840> that<00:02:59.870> battle

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
and quote what this means is that battle

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.780 
and quote what this means is that battle
frontier<00:03:00.650> was<00:03:00.860> not<00:03:01.069> implemented<00:03:01.489> because

frontier was not implemented because

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.819 
frontier was not implemented because
Game<00:03:02.209> Freak<00:03:02.420> felt<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.989> only<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.349> very<00:03:03.650> small

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
Game Freak felt that only a very small

Game Freak felt that only a very small
portion<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.640> players<00:03:04.879> would<00:03:05.209> come<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.569> to

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
portion of the players would come in to

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.020 
portion of the players would come in to
appreciate<00:03:06.319> such<00:03:06.620> feature<00:03:06.920> they<00:03:07.730> claimed

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
appreciate such feature they claimed

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.420 
appreciate such feature they claimed
that<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.329> today's<00:03:08.480> era<00:03:08.930> players<00:03:09.470> we<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.099> such

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
that in today's era players we have such

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.240 
that in today's era players we have such
and<00:03:10.819> easy<00:03:11.120> access<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.780> many<00:03:12.170> games<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:13.010> less

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
and easy access to many games that less

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.949 
and easy access to many games that less
and<00:03:13.280> less<00:03:13.579> time<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.239> devoted<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> single

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
and less time is devoted to a single

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.619 
and less time is devoted to a single
game<00:03:15.489> perhaps<00:03:16.489> there<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.849> some<00:03:17.030> truth<00:03:17.329> to<00:03:17.359> this

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629

game perhaps there is some truth to this
statement<00:03:18.140> but<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.349> feel<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.889> it<00:03:19.010> only

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
statement but I feel that it only

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.009 
statement but I feel that it only
applies<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.879> younger<00:03:20.239> generations<00:03:20.840> as

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
far as the better ends I feel we still

the games is because they were familiar
with<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.389> originals<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.709> I'm<00:03:33.859> also<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.220> player

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
with the originals but I'm also a player

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.460 
with the originals but I'm also a player
that<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.970> with<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.269> times<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:36.139> my<00:03:36.319> opinion

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
that is with the times and in my opinion

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.800 
that is with the times and in my opinion
Game<00:03:36.980> Freak<00:03:37.159> is<00:03:37.400> somewhat<00:03:37.819> right<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.450> battle

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
Game Freak is somewhat right the battle

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.110 
Game Freak is somewhat right the battle
frontier<00:03:39.079> served<00:03:39.500> as<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.769> challenge<00:03:40.430> because

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
frontier served as a challenge because

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.059 
frontier served as a challenge because
back<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.659> those<00:03:41.810> days<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.379> only<00:03:42.500> people<00:03:42.799> you

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
back in those days the only people you

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.610 
back in those days the only people you
could<00:03:43.280> battle<00:03:43.519> were<00:03:43.909> your<00:03:44.120> friends<00:03:44.629> but<00:03:45.290> now

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
could battle were your friends but now

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.990 
could battle were your friends but now
the<00:03:45.680> why<00:03:46.069> fought<00:03:46.310> battles<00:03:46.760> have<00:03:46.970> been

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
the why fought battles have been

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.729 
the why fought battles have been
introduced<00:03:47.599> it<00:03:47.840> seems<00:03:48.109> that<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.440> battle

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
introduced it seems that the battle

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.680 
introduced it seems that the battle
frontier<00:03:49.099> doesn't<00:03:49.639> serve<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.030> purpose<00:03:50.299> as

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
frontier doesn't serve that purpose as

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.439 
frontier doesn't serve that purpose as
much<00:03:51.049> as<00:03:51.230> before<00:03:51.760> everyone<00:03:52.760> is<00:03:52.849> focusing<00:03:53.329> on

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
much as before everyone is focusing on

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.990 
much as before everyone is focusing on
creating<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.989> perfect<00:03:54.199> Evie<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:55.040> IB<00:03:55.340> team<00:03:55.639> so

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
creating the perfect Evie and IB team so

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.490 
creating the perfect Evie and IB team so
that<00:03:56.030> they<00:03:56.329> can<00:03:56.540> test<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.900> out<00:03:56.989> with<00:03:57.230> players

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
that they can test it out with players

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.069 
that they can test it out with players
all<00:03:57.829> over<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:58.190> world<00:03:58.299> so<00:03:59.299> in<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.629> bright<00:03:59.840> side
