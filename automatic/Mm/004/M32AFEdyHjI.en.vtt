00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
much you can do it's better to have too

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
much you can do it's better to have too
much<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.939> lighting<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.930> capability<00:01:19.470> than<00:01:19.830> not

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
much like lighting a capability than not

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.940

enough<00:01:20.040> Montes<00:01:20.850> opinion<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.140> why<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.680> do

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
enough Montes opinion so that's why I do

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.130 
enough Montes opinion so that's why I do
have<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.880> 430ex<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.770> point<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:27.140> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have the 430ex to just point that out so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.390 
have the 430ex to just point that out so
that's<00:01:28.290> why<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:28.470> saying<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:28.950> bright

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that's why I'm saying it's not bright

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.030 
that's why I'm saying it's not bright
enough<00:01:29.670> sometimes<00:01:30.829> now<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.520> said<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.530> one

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
enough sometimes now that said it is one

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.819 
enough sometimes now that said it is one
of<00:01:35.130> canons<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.700> second<00:01:36.630> from<00:01:36.780> top<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
of canons a second from top and it is

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.999 
of canons a second from top and it is
much<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.280> affordable<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.030> higher-end

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
much more affordable than the higher-end

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
much more affordable than the higher-end
but<00:01:41.009> here's<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.610> got<00:01:42.060> me<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
but here's what really got me about the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.760 
but here's what really got me about the
speed<00:01:42.810> light<00:01:42.990> ken<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.970> advertising<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.390> has

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
speed light ken is advertising it has

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
speed light ken is advertising it has
color<00:01:46.770> temp<00:01:47.220> capabilities<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.420> stuff<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
color temp capabilities and stuff and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.620 
color temp capabilities and stuff and
when<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> first<00:01:49.470> read<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> guy

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
when I first read up on that I'm the guy

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.429 
when I first read up on that I'm the guy
they<00:01:51.630> might<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.930> done<00:01:52.110> something<00:01:52.350> like

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
they might have done something like

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.850 
they might have done something like
Apple<00:01:52.950> did<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.229> iPhones<00:01:55.229> doesn't<00:01:55.680> have

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
Apple did with the iPhones doesn't have

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.700 
Apple did with the iPhones doesn't have
a<00:01:56.100> light<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.390> change<00:01:57.570> color<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.439> help

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a light that can change color to help

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.130 
a light that can change color to help
with<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> color<00:01:59.490> tip<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.909> stuff<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> was

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
with just a color tip and stuff so I was

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.620 
with just a color tip and stuff so I was
like<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> first<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.799> was<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:01.979> really

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
like the first I was like really

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.080 
like the first I was like really
interested<00:02:03.630> start<00:02:04.500> reading<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> guess<00:02:05.640> what

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
interested start reading and guess what

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.660 
interested start reading and guess what
what<00:02:07.020> Canon<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.530> advertising<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> ability

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
what Canon is advertising is the ability

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.029 
what Canon is advertising is the ability
to<00:02:08.849> change<00:02:09.270> color<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:10.110> no<00:02:10.410> more<00:02:10.649> than<00:02:10.709> this

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to change color it's no more than this
