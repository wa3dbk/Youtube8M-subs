playing<00:00:09.630> FCS<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> few<00:00:11.250> reasons<00:00:11.429> one<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
playing FCS for a few reasons one the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.209 
playing FCS for a few reasons one the
games<00:00:12.719> take<00:00:12.990> extremely<00:00:13.500> long<00:00:13.830> because

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
games take extremely long because

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.460 
games take extremely long because
there's<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.549> much<00:00:14.670> scoring<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.330> two<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:16.199> kind

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
there's so much scoring and two it kind

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.050 
there's so much scoring and two it kind
of<00:00:16.590> screws<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> stats<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.520> little<00:00:17.760> bit<00:00:17.880> just

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
of screws up the stats a little bit just

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.540 
of screws up the stats a little bit just
because<00:00:18.289> you<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.590> score<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> lot<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.340> points

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
because you really score a lot of points

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.349 
because you really score a lot of points
and<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.480> really<00:00:21.720> realistic<00:00:22.080> um<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.550> yeah

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and it's not really realistic um so yeah

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.540 
and it's not really realistic um so yeah
but<00:00:24.570> having<00:00:25.350> said<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.980> wanted<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> keep

below
I<00:02:21.489> believe<00:02:22.120> Bennett's<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.689> sophomore<00:02:23.379> 88<00:02:24.189> and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
I believe Bennett's the sophomore 88 and

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.199 
I believe Bennett's the sophomore 88 and
Mariota<00:02:26.079> is<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.200> freshman<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.069> think<00:02:27.250> 79<00:02:27.819> overall

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
Mariota is a freshman I think 79 overall

Mariota is a freshman I think 79 overall
so<00:02:29.110> yeah<00:02:29.319> it's<00:02:29.470> already<00:02:29.709> like<00:02:29.829> 43<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.640> zero

it's<00:02:31.540> 40<00:02:31.870> 44<00:02:32.349> 7<00:02:32.769> sorry<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:34.000> already<00:02:34.269> past

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
it's 40 44 7 sorry and it's already past

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.649 
it's 40 44 7 sorry and it's already past

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
out of the guy's hand and I've just

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.379 
out of the guy's hand and I've just

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
started messing around with this long we

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.750 
started messing around with this long we
run<00:03:25.510> back<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.900> have<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.169> strip<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.340> get<00:03:27.579> in<00:03:27.669> the

he'll<00:03:29.410> actually<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.250> think<00:03:30.699> he<00:03:30.910> had<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> pick

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
he'll actually I think he had a pick

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.420 
he'll actually I think he had a pick
before<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.959> that's<00:03:32.199> I<00:03:32.470> think<00:03:32.889> that<00:03:33.250> would

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
before and that's I think that would

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.939 
before and that's I think that would
come<00:03:33.730> as<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:33.940> fumble<00:03:34.269> recovery<00:03:34.680> pretty<00:03:35.680> sweet

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
come as a fumble recovery pretty sweet

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.280 
come as a fumble recovery pretty sweet
the<00:03:36.639> highlight<00:03:37.030> me<00:03:37.480> running<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.900> stumbling

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
the highlight me running and stumbling

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.869 
the highlight me running and stumbling
okay<00:03:39.310> oh<00:03:39.489> no<00:03:40.329> oh<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.400> would<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.609> fell

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
okay oh no oh if you would have fell

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.240 
okay oh no oh if you would have fell
that<00:03:43.060> would<00:03:43.180> have<00:03:43.269> felt<00:03:43.449> bad<00:03:43.660> but<00:03:44.440> still<00:03:45.220> a

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
that would have felt bad but still a

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.640 
that would have felt bad but still a
good<00:03:45.370> play<00:03:45.750> they<00:03:46.750> got<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.959> field<00:03:47.199> goal<00:03:47.379> here<00:03:47.620> I

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
good play they got a field goal here I

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.170 
good play they got a field goal here I
think<00:03:47.949> this<00:03:48.129> is<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.370> last<00:03:48.549> point<00:03:48.760> they<00:03:48.970> score

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
think this is the last point they score

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.369 
think this is the last point they score
the<00:03:49.389> game<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:50.349> make<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:51.389> sixty<00:03:52.389> seven<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.870> ten<00:03:53.109> I

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
the game to make it sixty seven to ten I

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.599 
the game to make it sixty seven to ten I
think<00:03:53.980> that's<00:03:54.129> what<00:03:54.250> we're<00:03:54.400> at<00:03:54.519> know<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:56.260> yeah

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
think that's what we're at know so yeah

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.860 
think that's what we're at know so yeah
6710<00:03:57.609> it's<00:03:57.849> almost<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.239> end<00:03:58.269> of<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.569> third

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
6710 it's almost the end of the third

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.640 
6710 it's almost the end of the third
give<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.739> little<00:04:00.010> hand<00:04:00.250> off<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.940> mr.<00:04:01.060> barter<00:04:01.650> and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
give a little hand off to mr. barter and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.930 
give a little hand off to mr. barter and
he's<00:04:02.859> gonna<00:04:03.040> take<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.549> house<00:04:03.639> once

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
he's gonna take it to the house once

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.229 
he's gonna take it to the house once
again<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.750> think<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.109> ended<00:04:05.379> up<00:04:05.440> scoring<00:04:06.239> 90

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
again I think I ended up scoring 90

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.689 
again I think I ended up scoring 90
points<00:04:07.870> 87<00:04:08.440> points<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.799> think<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:09.220> think<00:04:09.549> that's

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
points 87 points I think I think that's

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.089 
points 87 points I think I think that's
what<00:04:09.849> I<00:04:09.909> finished<00:04:10.120> with<00:04:10.799> so<00:04:11.799> it's<00:04:11.889> pretty

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.000 
to return the punt and he brings it back
again<00:04:44.139> just<00:04:44.979> ridiculous<00:04:45.610> he's<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.060> fast<00:04:47.010> it's

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.830

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.890 
and that's actually the last score the
game<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.300> think<00:04:52.360> for<00:04:53.020> me<00:04:53.699> maybe<00:04:54.699> not<00:04:54.729> maybe<00:04:55.690> it

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
game I think for me maybe not maybe it

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.659 
game I think for me maybe not maybe it
is<00:04:56.020> oh<00:04:56.229> yeah<00:04:56.650> we<00:04:56.740> get<00:04:56.889> an<00:04:56.979> interception<00:04:57.400> that

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669
