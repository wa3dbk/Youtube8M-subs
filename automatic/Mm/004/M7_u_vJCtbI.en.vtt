00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
going to make this video very brief

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.589 
going to make this video very brief
because<00:00:10.980> Chelsea<00:00:11.700> pretty<00:00:12.000> much<00:00:12.120> dominated

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
because Chelsea pretty much dominated

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.410 
because Chelsea pretty much dominated
the<00:00:12.750> whole<00:00:12.870> match<00:00:13.790> possession<00:00:14.790> wise<00:00:14.940> they<00:00:15.240> had

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the whole match possession wise they had

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.990 
the whole match possession wise they had
more<00:00:15.719> possession<00:00:15.929> obviously<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.430> 6-1

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
more possession obviously with the 6-1

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.359 
more possession obviously with the 6-1
win<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:19.789> win<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:22.250> kind<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
win this is a win that is kind of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
win this is a win that is kind of
bittersweet<00:00:23.640> because<00:00:24.090> if<00:00:24.689> only<00:00:24.960> event<00:00:25.590> is

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
bittersweet because if only event is

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920 
bittersweet because if only event is
lost<00:00:26.039> which<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> hard<00:00:27.060> thing<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.510> you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
lost which is a hard thing because you

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.480 
lost which is a hard thing because you
vent<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.260> barely<00:00:28.470> losses<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.130> city<00:00:29.400> ah

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
vent just barely losses in the city ah

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.510 
vent just barely losses in the city ah
so<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.529> shaping<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.189> think<00:00:32.369> they've

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so and shaping see I don't think they've

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
so and shaping see I don't think they've
watched<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:34.050> went<00:00:34.260> ahead<00:00:34.410> with

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
watched it but they went ahead with

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
watched it but they went ahead with
Shakhtar<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.270> bittersweet

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
Shakhtar it's kind of bittersweet

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.830 
Shakhtar it's kind of bittersweet
because<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.829> win<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.309> dominant<00:00:39.000> win<00:00:39.180> doesn't

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
because the win a dominant win doesn't

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.000 
because the win a dominant win doesn't
lead<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:41.390> advent<00:00:42.390> around<00:00:43.200> advance<00:00:43.649> for

it<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> very<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> nice<00:01:12.540> goal

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it was a very you know as a nice goal

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410 
it was a very you know as a nice goal
wasn't<00:01:13.049> spectacular<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> other<00:01:14.880> other

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
wasn't spectacular and the other other

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630 
wasn't spectacular and the other other
goal<00:01:16.110> was<00:01:16.320> off<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> crossing<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> he<00:01:17.369> stuck<00:01:17.610> his

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.280 
goal was off a crossing and he stuck his
 out<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.049> Juan

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
 out there I think it was from Juan

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.490 
 out there I think it was from Juan
Mata<00:01:19.530> who<00:01:20.250> also<00:01:20.670> scored<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.240> game<00:01:21.479> after<00:01:22.259> he

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
Mata who also scored this game after he

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
Mata who also scored this game after he
shot<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> ball<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:23.790> saved<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> he

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
shot the ball but it was saved and he

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
shot the ball but it was saved and he
was<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.600> his<00:01:24.659> rebound<00:01:25.140> his<00:01:25.320> own<00:01:25.439> rebound<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
was on his rebound his own rebound and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
was on his rebound his own rebound and
he<00:01:26.520> scored<00:01:26.880> he<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.600> deserving<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> go

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
he scored he was very deserving to go

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.870 
he scored he was very deserving to go
towards<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.340> he<00:01:29.460> was<00:01:29.549> running<00:01:29.790> around

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
towards you know he was running around

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
towards you know he was running around
and<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:31.049> he<00:01:31.140> desired<00:01:31.500> those<00:01:31.619> two<00:01:31.770> goals

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and I think he desired those two goals

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.249 
and I think he desired those two goals
it's<00:01:32.220> been<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> long<00:01:32.640> time<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.200> you

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
from one match i'm not sure but uh

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.180

force<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.310> penalty<00:02:11.640> kick<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:11.879> Eden<00:02:12.660> Hazard

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
