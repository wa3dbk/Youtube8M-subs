a<00:00:00.060> little<00:00:00.599> bit<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.780> that<00:00:00.900> I'm<00:00:01.079> gonna<00:00:01.230> hold<00:00:01.500> it

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
a little bit of that I'm gonna hold it

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.570 
a little bit of that I'm gonna hold it
together<00:00:01.740> so<00:00:02.190> that<00:00:03.980> some<00:00:04.980> gum<00:00:05.130> needs<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.460> be

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
together so that some gum needs to be

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.450 
together so that some gum needs to be
sheared<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.839> order<00:00:07.109> for<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> work<00:00:07.529> or<00:00:07.980> that

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
sheared in order for it to work or that

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.000 
sheared in order for it to work or that
the<00:00:09.120> thick<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.570> sharing<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.590> mean<00:00:10.800> by

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
the thick and sharing I mean by

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.079 
the thick and sharing I mean by
splitting<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.820> actual<00:00:12.769> gradual<00:00:13.769> path<00:00:14.280> that

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
splitting the actual gradual path that

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.340 
splitting the actual gradual path that
can<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.330> achieved<00:00:15.660> either<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.230> hand

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
can be achieved either with a hand

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.500 
can be achieved either with a hand
blender<00:00:16.410> or<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.520> these<00:00:17.609> leathers<00:00:18.090> never

put it in a ruble hoop never do it by

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.029 
put it in a ruble hoop never do it by
adds<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.119> need<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.689> cut<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.289> gradual<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.830> half

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
adds you need to cut the gradual in half

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.179 
adds you need to cut the gradual in half
in<00:00:23.340> order<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.300> Sigma<00:00:24.960> type

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
in order for it to actually Sigma type

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.060 
in order for it to actually Sigma type
this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.849> now<00:00:28.039> put<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this is what we're going to do now put a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.209 
this is what we're going to do now put a
little<00:00:29.250> bit<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> verse<00:00:29.609> 11<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:37.040> back<00:00:38.040> and

open<00:00:39.920> for<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.070> amount<00:00:41.370> I'd<00:00:41.579> probably<00:00:41.790> say

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
open for this amount I'd probably say

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:53.380 
open for this amount I'd probably say
about<00:00:42.120> two

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.819 

we<00:00:54.390> started<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.050> again<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.620> said

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
we started in here again like I said

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
we started in here again like I said
really<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.870> nicely

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
really got to get it going get it nicely

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:09.040 
really got to get it going get it nicely
blend<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.239> as<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.570> 30<00:01:00.960> double<00:01:01.350> decide

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.890 

that's<00:01:10.050> already<00:01:10.200> doubled<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.710> size

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
that's already doubled in size

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:21.950 
that's already doubled in size
stabilizes<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.940> then<00:01:21.119> once<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.570> really

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
stabilizes and then once it's really

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
stabilizes and then once it's really
nice<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.380> blended<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> help<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> our

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
nice and blended with the help of our

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.150 
nice and blended with the help of our
trusty<00:01:24.330> mr.<00:01:25.050> Flender<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
trusty mr. Flender we're going to

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.520 
trusty mr. Flender we're going to
transfer<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.910> our<00:01:27.350> KitchenAid<00:01:28.350> stand

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
transfer it to our KitchenAid stand

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.999 
transfer it to our KitchenAid stand
mixer<00:01:29.039> really<00:01:29.550> women<00:01:34.310> that's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.789> bit

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
mixer really women that's a little bit

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.200 
mixer really women that's a little bit
probably<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.190> even<00:01:38.429> like<00:01:38.580> an<00:01:38.700> eighth<00:01:38.910> of<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
probably go even like an eighth of a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:02:34.130 
probably go even like an eighth of a
teaspoon

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:47.640 

good<00:02:35.140> job<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:43.540> here<00:02:45.420> little<00:02:46.420> thicker<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.230> died

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
good job in here little thicker it died

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.199 
good job in here little thicker it died
down<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.370> dampers<00:02:48.700> little<00:02:48.910> heavy<00:02:49.090> right

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
down to the dampers little heavy right

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.020 
down to the dampers little heavy right
made<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.200> actually<00:02:50.560> more<00:02:50.769> denser<00:02:51.280> but<00:02:51.879> now

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
made it actually more denser but now

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.610 
made it actually more denser but now
this<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.359> where<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> aeration<00:02:53.140> process<00:02:53.170> is

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
this is where the aeration process is

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.930 
this is where the aeration process is
going<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.829> come<00:02:53.950> into<00:02:54.069> play<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.489> little<00:02:54.640> like

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
going to come into play a little like

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:04.039 
going to come into play a little like
triple<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.480> size<00:03:02.040> these<00:03:03.040> are<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.340> egg<00:03:03.519> white

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049

tonight right now going up I gather a

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.300 
tonight right now going up I gather a
rip<00:03:09.220> they<00:03:09.370> grow<00:03:09.629> slower<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.870> better<00:03:10.900> why<00:03:11.560> our

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
but the bubble is large right if you

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.820 
but the bubble is large right if you
take<00:03:24.700> your<00:03:24.880> conference<00:03:25.510> will<00:03:25.870> be<00:03:26.050> published
