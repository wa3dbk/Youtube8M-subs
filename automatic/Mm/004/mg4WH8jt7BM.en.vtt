00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
really great tool to use to get gestures

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.010 
really great tool to use to get gestures
like<00:01:02.920> touch<00:01:03.219> you<00:01:03.640> know<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:04.390> know<00:01:04.479> tapping

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
like touch you know you know tapping

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.560 
like touch you know you know tapping

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.320 
swiping and zooming or any sort of
features<00:01:07.869> like<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.940> Scott<00:01:09.940> if<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.149> want<00:01:10.270> to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
features like that Scott if you want to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.389 
features like that Scott if you want to
talk<00:01:10.420> about<00:01:10.539> about<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.050> implementation<00:01:11.399> yep

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
talk about about the implementation yep

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.570 
talk about about the implementation yep
we<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:12.820> do<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.119> so<00:01:13.479> hammer<00:01:14.229> j/s<00:01:14.710> comes<00:01:15.280> as

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
we can do that so hammer j/s comes as

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.139 
we can do that so hammer j/s comes as
either<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.179> standalone<00:01:16.929> library<00:01:17.560> or<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:18.490> jQuery

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
either a standalone library or a jQuery

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.910 
either a standalone library or a jQuery
library<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.200> those<00:01:20.470> of<00:01:20.500> you<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.770> are

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
library so those of you that are

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.340 
library so those of you that are
familiar<00:01:21.250> with<00:01:21.369> jQuery<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:22.630> could<00:01:22.869> implement

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
familiar with jQuery you could implement

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.590 
familiar with jQuery you could implement
it<00:01:23.619> into<00:01:23.740> your<00:01:23.860> site<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.580> use<00:01:25.119> jQuery

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
it into your site and use jQuery

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.540 
it into your site and use jQuery
functionality<00:01:26.350> rather<00:01:26.860> than<00:01:27.130> just<00:01:27.429> the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
functionality rather than just the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.330 
functionality rather than just the
standalone<00:01:27.940> functionality<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:30.009> really

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
standalone functionality it's really

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.910 
standalone functionality it's really
easy<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.670> implement<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.569> script<00:01:32.200> itself<00:01:32.709> is

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
easy to implement the script itself is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.410 
easy to implement the script itself is
actually<00:01:33.250> only<00:01:33.399> two<00:01:33.610> kilobytes<00:01:34.119> when<00:01:34.300> it's

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
actually only two kilobytes when it's

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.930 
actually only two kilobytes when it's
minified<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.259> it's<00:01:35.950> it's<00:01:36.250> very<00:01:36.340> little<00:01:36.759> load

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
minified so it's it's very little load

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.839 
minified so it's it's very little load
time<00:01:40.349> it's<00:01:41.349> a<00:01:41.470> focus<00:01:41.860> javascript<00:01:42.399> library

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
time it's a focus javascript library

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.089 
time it's a focus javascript library
it's<00:01:43.060> only<00:01:43.360> four<00:01:43.869> touch<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.770> multi-touch

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
it's only four touch and multi-touch

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.400 
it's only four touch and multi-touch
gestures<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.149> can<00:01:49.330> do<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.259> can

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
gestures and what you can do is you can

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.620 
gestures and what you can do is you can
attach<00:01:51.069> it<00:01:51.099> to<00:01:51.310> any<00:01:51.459> element<00:01:51.970> on<00:01:52.060> your<00:01:52.239> website

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
attach it to any element on your website

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.080 
attach it to any element on your website
pretty<00:01:52.840> much<00:01:53.050> so<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.709> can<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.340> know<00:01:54.459> say<00:01:54.759> for

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
pretty much so you can you know say for

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.150 
pretty much so you can you know say for
instance<00:01:55.360> your<00:01:55.630> logo<00:01:55.989> if<00:01:56.229> somebody<00:01:56.619> swipes<00:01:56.950> on

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
instance your logo if somebody swipes on

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.680 
instance your logo if somebody swipes on
that<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.459> changed<00:01:57.819> to<00:01:57.849> a<00:01:57.970> different<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.660> know

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
that it changed to a different you know

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.350 
that it changed to a different you know
version<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.289> that<00:01:59.440> or<00:01:59.739> you<00:02:00.550> know<00:02:00.670> pages<00:02:01.209> and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
version of that or you know pages and

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.510 
version of that or you know pages and
WordPress<00:02:01.750> want<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> swipe<00:02:02.380> switch<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.160> pages

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
WordPress want to swipe switch the pages

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.760 
WordPress want to swipe switch the pages
go<00:02:03.849> ahead<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.149> do<00:02:04.239> that<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.690> I'm<00:02:05.530> really

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
go ahead and do that so I'm really

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.199 
go ahead and do that so I'm really
shocked<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.160> see<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.369> there<00:02:06.700> isn't<00:02:06.970> more<00:02:07.090> of

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
shocked to see that there isn't more of

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.580 
shocked to see that there isn't more of
this<00:02:07.300> implementation<00:02:07.810> out<00:02:08.110> there<00:02:08.319> these<00:02:08.530> days

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
this implementation out there these days

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.889 
this implementation out there these days
I<00:02:09.129> guess<00:02:09.670> maybe<00:02:09.849> it's<00:02:10.030> because<00:02:10.119> because<00:02:10.660> it

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
I guess maybe it's because because it

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.600 
I guess maybe it's because because it
comes<00:02:11.140> more<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.560> form<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.770> apps<00:02:12.040> that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
comes more in the form of apps that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.010 
comes more in the form of apps that
developers<00:02:13.000> put<00:02:13.150> out<00:02:13.270> for<00:02:13.450> these<00:02:13.569> devices<00:02:13.989> for

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
developers put out for these devices for

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.280 
developers put out for these devices for
your<00:02:14.230> androids<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:14.800> your<00:02:14.890> iPhones<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:16.290> that

your androids for your iPhones that that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.630 
your androids for your iPhones that that
sort<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.590> gives<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.890> ability<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.610> that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
sort of gives it that ability in that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.920 
sort of gives it that ability in that
implementation<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.569> really<00:02:19.780> wish<00:02:19.900> that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
implementation but I really wish that

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.750 
implementation but I really wish that
more<00:02:20.140> websites<00:02:20.530> had<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.340> had<00:02:21.459> features

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
more websites had think had features

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.339 
more websites had think had features

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
like this built in yeah I do as well

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.500 
like this built in yeah I do as well
because<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:24.069> feel<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.849> we're<00:02:24.970> moving<00:02:25.330> that

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
way we're moving towards apps and as

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.540 
way we're moving towards apps and as
more<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.140> more<00:02:29.290> users<00:02:29.739> become<00:02:30.069> familiar<00:02:30.459> with

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
more and more users become familiar with

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.360 
more and more users become familiar with
the<00:02:30.879> gestures<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:32.109> can<00:02:32.140> literally<00:02:32.560> turn<00:02:33.189> your

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the gestures you can literally turn your

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
website into we'll call it an app

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.390 
website into we'll call it an app
because

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
because

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.610 
because
it<00:02:35.730> has<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.329> function<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.750> lot<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.409> lot

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
it has all the function a lot of a lot

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.449 
it has all the function a lot of a lot
of<00:02:37.769> places<00:02:38.099> now<00:02:38.370> are<00:02:38.400> designing<00:02:38.849> responsive

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
of places now are designing responsive

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.250 
of places now are designing responsive
websites<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.549> know<00:02:41.610> our<00:02:41.819> studio<00:02:42.629> here<00:02:42.870> does<00:02:43.049> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
websites I know our studio here does the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.649 
websites I know our studio here does the
does<00:02:43.950> our<00:02:44.069> minimize<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.700> theme<00:02:45.000> which<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.360> for

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659

WordPress<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:46.409> responsive<00:02:46.980> app<00:02:47.129> so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
WordPress is a very responsive app so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.920 
WordPress is a very responsive app so
basically<00:02:47.849> what<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.030> does<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.510> takes<00:02:48.750> your

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
basically what that does is takes your

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.750 
basically what that does is takes your
website<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.860> puts<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.129> down<00:02:50.159> into<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.489> mobile

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
website and puts it down into a mobile

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
website and puts it down into a mobile
device<00:02:50.970> size<00:02:51.269> so<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.049> it's<00:02:52.349> kind<00:02:52.620> of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
device size so that it's kind of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.410 
device size so that it's kind of
formatted<00:02:53.129> for<00:02:53.340> their<00:02:53.519> what<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> perfect

the swipe gestures as well things like
that<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.530> brought<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.739> up<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:08.159> little

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that you brought that up a little

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.309 
that you brought that up a little
earlier<00:04:08.669> yeah<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.090> can<00:04:09.389> actually<00:04:09.569> also<00:04:09.870> hold

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
earlier yeah you can actually also hold

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.860 
earlier yeah you can actually also hold
down<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.859> an<00:04:10.979> element<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.540> actually

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
down on an element and this actually

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.539 
down on an element and this actually
brings<00:04:13.079> me<00:04:13.199> to<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> good<00:04:13.680> point<00:04:13.889> so<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.280> can

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
brings me to a good point so you can

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.490 
brings me to a good point so you can
actually<00:04:14.760> set<00:04:15.180> specific<00:04:15.720> options<00:04:16.169> for<00:04:16.380> this

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
actually set specific options for this

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.560 
actually set specific options for this
plug-in<00:04:16.739> which<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.579> really<00:04:17.849> cool<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.299> can

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
plug-in which is really cool so you can

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.689 
plug-in which is really cool so you can
say<00:04:18.810> on<00:04:19.289> this<00:04:19.560> particular<00:04:19.859> element<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.489> want

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
say on this particular element I want

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.360 
say on this particular element I want
the<00:04:20.880> user<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.150> have<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.510> hold<00:04:21.690> down<00:04:21.780> for<00:04:22.380> half

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
the user to have to hold down for half

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.520 
the user to have to hold down for half
of<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.610> second<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.120> then<00:04:24.510> something's<00:04:25.320> going

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
of a second and then something's going

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.939 
of a second and then something's going
to<00:04:25.560> happen

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
to happen

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.800 
to happen
so<00:04:26.280> this<00:04:26.490> library<00:04:26.909> supports<00:04:27.419> that

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
so this library supports that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.920 
so this library supports that
functionality<00:04:28.380> as<00:04:28.710> well<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:29.820> can<00:04:30.000> also<00:04:30.240> set

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
functionality as well you can also set

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.350 
functionality as well you can also set
the<00:04:31.080> swipe<00:04:31.349> time<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.010> how<00:04:32.250> fast<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:33.060> users

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
the swipe time so how fast the users

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.210 
the swipe time so how fast the users
need<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.960> swipe<00:04:34.199> in<00:04:34.710> order<00:04:34.979> for<00:04:35.159> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
need to swipe in order for the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.060 
need to swipe in order for the
functionality<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.320> occur<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:37.830> cool

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
functionality to occur that is so cool

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.370 
functionality to occur that is so cool
yeah<00:04:38.310> it's<00:04:38.520> pretty<00:04:38.699> neat<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.659> then<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:40.199> can

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
yeah it's pretty neat and then you can

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.680 
yeah it's pretty neat and then you can
also<00:04:40.590> for<00:04:41.130> instance<00:04:41.430> set<00:04:41.789> an<00:04:41.970> element<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.510> only

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
also for instance set an element to only

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.529 
also for instance set an element to only
respond<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.409> the<00:04:43.650> tap<00:04:43.889> so<00:04:44.250> if<00:04:44.639> you<00:04:44.789> want<00:04:45.029> just<00:04:45.419> a

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
respond to the tap so if you want just a

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.570 
respond to the tap so if you want just a
single<00:04:45.840> tap<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.409> this<00:04:46.620> particular<00:04:46.919> element<00:04:47.279> on

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
single tap on this particular element on

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.399 
single tap on this particular element on
your<00:04:47.610> page<00:04:47.760> user<00:04:48.630> taps<00:04:48.960> on

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
your page user taps on

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.589 
your page user taps on
it<00:04:49.469> works<00:04:49.769> if<00:04:50.039> they<00:04:50.159> DoubleTap<00:04:50.699> nothing

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
it works if they DoubleTap nothing

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.159 
it works if they DoubleTap nothing
happens<00:04:51.989> but<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:52.439> would<00:04:52.559> be<00:04:52.709> of<00:04:52.949> course<00:04:53.459> it's

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
happens but that would be of course it's

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.829 
happens but that would be of course it's
customizable<00:04:55.169> up<00:04:55.499> to<00:04:55.649> your<00:04:55.830> liking<00:04:56.159> so<00:04:56.839> it's

00:04:57.829 --> 00:04:57.839 
customizable up to your liking so it's

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.089 
customizable up to your liking so it's
almost<00:04:57.989> ahead<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.349> its<00:04:58.469> time<00:04:58.529> in<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.889> sense

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
almost ahead of its time in a sense

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.159 
almost ahead of its time in a sense
because<00:04:59.309> I<00:04:59.429> don't<00:04:59.580> even<00:04:59.639> see<00:04:59.909> most<00:05:00.149> apps<00:05:00.449> using

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
because I don't even see most apps using

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.839 
because I don't even see most apps using
a<00:05:01.349> hold<00:05:01.529> functionality<00:05:02.159> which<00:05:02.429> is<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.610> really

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
a hold functionality which is a really

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.309 
a hold functionality which is a really
great<00:05:03.059> thing<00:05:03.179> I<00:05:03.269> know<00:05:03.330> I'll<00:05:03.479> be<00:05:03.599> driving<00:05:04.110> home

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
great thing I know I'll be driving home

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.540 
great thing I know I'll be driving home
I<00:05:04.559> supposed<00:05:04.769> to<00:05:04.800> use<00:05:04.949> my<00:05:05.069> phone<00:05:06.619> my<00:05:07.619> hands<00:05:08.339> and

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
I supposed to use my phone my hands and

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.489 
I supposed to use my phone my hands and
I<00:05:08.639> actually<00:05:09.209> only<00:05:09.479> tap<00:05:09.659> on<00:05:09.839> something<00:05:10.019> having

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:10.499 
I actually only tap on something having

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:11.600 
I actually only tap on something having
that<00:05:10.589> hold<00:05:10.800> feature<00:05:10.979> would<00:05:11.159> alleviate<00:05:11.369> that

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
that hold feature would alleviate that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.639 
that hold feature would alleviate that
problem<00:05:11.999> yes<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.229> don't<00:05:13.349> really<00:05:13.439> see<00:05:13.529> a

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:13.649 
problem yes and you don't really see a

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:16.279 
problem yes and you don't really see a
lot<00:05:13.679> of<00:05:13.889> that<00:05:14.009> you<00:05:14.279> know<00:05:15.269> speed<00:05:15.719> swipe<00:05:16.080> gesture

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
lot of that you know speed swipe gesture

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.600 
lot of that you know speed swipe gesture
thing<00:05:16.559> either<00:05:16.679> which<00:05:16.889> I<00:05:16.979> think<00:05:17.159> would<00:05:17.249> also<00:05:17.399> be

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
thing either which I think would also be

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.279 
thing either which I think would also be
really<00:05:17.729> really<00:05:18.149> great<00:05:18.360> implementation<00:05:19.080> and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
really really great implementation and

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.799 
really really great implementation and
many<00:05:19.529> websites<00:05:20.009> yeah<00:05:20.489> and<00:05:20.729> I<00:05:20.909> think<00:05:21.209> another

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:21.809 
many websites yeah and I think another

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.049 
many websites yeah and I think another
good<00:05:22.139> use<00:05:22.769> for<00:05:22.829> it<00:05:23.099> might<00:05:23.339> be<00:05:23.519> like<00:05:23.789> a<00:05:23.819> hidden

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:24.059 
good use for it might be like a hidden

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.569 
good use for it might be like a hidden
easter<00:05:24.300> egg<00:05:24.659> yeah<00:05:25.139> it<00:05:25.649> was<00:05:25.739> the<00:05:25.919> event<00:05:26.459> you

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:26.579 
easter egg yeah it was the event you

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:28.219 
easter egg yeah it was the event you
