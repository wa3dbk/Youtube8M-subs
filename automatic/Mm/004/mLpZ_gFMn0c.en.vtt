00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 on Monday prefer the movie lounge to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.280
 trailer and treviso everything is upside down 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.440
 new pixar animated movie radis elf 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.570
 years old but because her father's job is new 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.190
 She has accepted her home 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.900
 leave and now go to san 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.699
 francisco pulling or playing in the head 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.470
 her feelings are crazy and that's exactly what they are 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 also the protagonists in this film 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.350
 we are in the mood for fear of disgust 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 and mourning and joy so just one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.789
 the protagonist wants somehow 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.740
 the positive look at ea change 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.840
 but the others for yes rather negative 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.350
 Emotional emotions worry in the head 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.719
 really for that he reilly himself 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.100
 blocked, and not as much fun to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.110
 ten francisco can get 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 but in the end she has to look like 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 she goes to this changed everyday life 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.079
 These five have to go to and there 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.300
 various emotions in the head finally 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.559
 agree how the whole looks like if 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.930
 you have to imagine that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.680
 Afterwards, how was the first day in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 the new school 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.149
 he thinks i'm okay no idea 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.000
 Do you sometimes see someone else asking? 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.130
 you what is going well in his head of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.689
 metals did you notice that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.170
 it's not true, we'll fix it 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.090
 the reason 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:23.310
 but we need support signal 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:26.460
 to which one looks at us what they 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.200
 said what nobody had to listen to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.960
 after out the klobrille was after 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.740
 above what will woman waas still a team 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.780
 Signal and Reilly was the new school 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.189
 and that can not be true 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.450
 we have the brazilian for that 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.450
 pilots dumped 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.130
 The school was great what they wanted 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.549
 We do not pretend that everything is okay 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.469
 Reilly is all right she has 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.640
 just the eyes representative a little 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.679
 shot of a book I do not want to be the same 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.179
 a power word speak no no 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.289
 say reilly 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.289
 This new sound found 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.340
 I do not know where from this one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:24.970
 disrespectful sound key 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.540
 Safety position ready to start 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.540
 their chance 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.630
 Do not answer his room now 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.630
 Spoken spoken word 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.960
 very close to a catastrophe 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.960
 that was a disaster 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.520
 Come fly with me 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.499
 fix as he has known for years 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.510
 to create quite innovative films 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:03.510
 great stories to tell yet 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.769
 Some critics think so too and that 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.030
 You really can only do that 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.499
 just sign that in the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.969
 last years, you a bit 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.139
 have weakened all the more exciting and 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.989
 more exciting because it is actually the question 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.790
 what makes pixar out of such an idea 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.620
 on the one hand maybe one like that 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.819
 bit upside down and went on the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.129
 other side but double and triple 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.469
 awesome and you can tell already 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.569
 after a few minutes that movie 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.969
 just an incredible magic 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.200
 radiates and as brilliant 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:31.709
 is written that the dialogues 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.569
 between them, they feel awfully good 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.269
 are that this whole from the head in 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.579
 change your head 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.049
 that has been implemented very well 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.419
 that it's just really at every point 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.790
 fits that one finds himself again 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.189
 also in this whole bustle of 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.049
 Everyone knows how it feels when emotions 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.370
 one has so different feelings one 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.859
 happy but also scared 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.959
 what prevails why does it outweigh that 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.699
 negative actually then so often and 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.259
 that's the nice thing about it 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.060
 film just as entertainment 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.519
 can look as well as that is quite 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.049
 Funny and I can somehow 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.879
 everything had at one time but at the same time 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.349
 also very accurately researched 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.060
 explains gets up that's the 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.560
 That means everything is right or wrong 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.329
 as biological as all that 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.829
 head and body happens 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.139
 that is actually really so 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.590
 something like this movie the knight beat 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.509
 Do it on one side 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.729
 technically absolutely correct and 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.039
 totally fascinating if you really 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.930
 he also learns something at the same time 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.180
 but also very charming characters 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.220
 beautiful dialogues incredibly horny 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.580
 animated and it's just like that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.440
 imaginative and so full of perfection 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.210
 that one can only say pixar is 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.219
 really back with one 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.259
 bang a long time no longer such a 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.630
 great animated films seen the 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.849
 just show what you can do with this medium 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.139
 you can make yourself creative 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.630
 thinking out stories you can do things 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.639
 you create that as a real movie 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.469
 can not implement at all and 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.560
 just kids as well 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.360
 Adults as well as so the 14 to 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.289
 19 year olds often entertain 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.330
