00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.650
 Of course it was not just as numbers but several times back to the 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.679
 File more expensive 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.109
 by giving her a second number 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.509
 even if I'm on the rent I'm short here with the never the track so one 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.769
 audio track 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.499
 but I can too 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.970
 because he's nothing 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.089
 just go to generate generate audio track 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.679
 and already I have a new Audi tracks can also do something 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 It is always good to label these traces immediately 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 the one with 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420
 you later know what you are here 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.340
 because if you later percent as it was once Reinhard and 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.030
 Betting Fekter and everything possible and here has ten tracks on 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.580
 One has very quickly lost the overview of what is so long is easy 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.690
 my missing that is to be united 1 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.230
 Criticism of some I do that now 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 removed is similar to 2 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.860
 if I do not want to have it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 just click there and work that Chen 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.150
 Labeling is also about edit rename 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.070
 took a hand 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.080
 Now if I double-click on mine here 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.180
 Give Citi a window down here 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 that's the same window 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.640
 Here you can see your compulsion 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.800
 from the beginning to the end so it starts slowly 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.260
 with this run with their trekkers 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.670
 and with the guest and Petit come to an end 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.700
 cares in a well-groomed times 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.020
 and she suddenly very little 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.100
 that's not because that's just a clipping 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 See below in the timeline where he's been wearing 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 and down here 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.770
 nevertheless survey window means 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.470
 that's all the anger 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.049
 you can see that is only a small section of Prada shown here 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.919
 that one is on but much larger 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.329
 and the whole sense just 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.569
 with the mouse that it becomes a magnifying glass 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.569
 at CeBIT will hold and then pull up 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.360
 and the whole thing came back again 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.049
 It may well happen then he starts forcing and he runs suddenly 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.669
 have a lot faster or are much afraid 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.549
 that's because he's just that different 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.349
 Oh, that's live 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.629
 Miyama a specific 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.479
 just that in the one 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.239
 When turned on, one has scored all and scores on a global one 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.479
 Tempo around 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.479
 is quantified so to speak 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.469
 if you now who in these centers a liter goes double-click 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.049
 DS the places 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.990
 the GEZ Derek Jeter 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.990
 and here a board button 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.719
 your word is out 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.839
 I think it was always like this 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.939
 The city plays the market like a coordinate 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.299
 you see, so are the speeds 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.299
 that the original speed has us 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.299
 the density over 135 as pm 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.449
 if there is employed 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.690
 then the global speed applies 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.480
 the global speed is the one set up in the corner here 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.019
 the chalk down at 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.419
 20 ppm not 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.299
 2 if I say no again 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.849
 he does not play offspring 35 the Peanuts but on the 120 BPM 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.709
 Tomorrow looks 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.709
 one third of the table 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.649
 the most famous hits belonged 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.639
 but if I have all 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.389
 So obviously from all the injured Heinz g then always directed 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.490
 Tempo after what rhymed 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.490
 is little 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.449
 change this 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.449
 he 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.559
 Dr 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:42.460
 who likes 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.460
 the 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.090
 cath 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.379
 more the 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:56.379
 Our Terms 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.569
 always back 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.740
 when I was there exhibited 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.169
 Sit the mirror 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.860
 set speed 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.789
 then I can do what I want here 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.319
 it does not change anything to become quite fast 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.639
 the whole club will be 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.639
 here is an almost 135 points 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.009
 So Butzko only one thing 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.150
 That's what we'll see later at the next, that's not necessary 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.330
 that for the g20 get an equal speed in their songs 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.279
 one again 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.099
 first to merge in the midst of a 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.590
 if he only plays the Volt and the original 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.629
 speed 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.770
 Countries the guests only the so Borkumer set up 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.190
 BT
