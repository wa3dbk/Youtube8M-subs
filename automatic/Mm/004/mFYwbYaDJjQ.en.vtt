used<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:14.810> already<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:16.479> did<00:01:17.479> quite<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.960> bit

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
used it already and did quite a bit

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.469 
used it already and did quite a bit
extreme<00:01:18.440> trimming<00:01:19.009> I'll<00:01:19.399> say<00:01:19.729> right<00:01:20.000> off<00:01:20.240> that

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
extreme trimming I'll say right off that

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.810 
extreme trimming I'll say right off that
I<00:01:20.539> like<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.990> unit<00:01:21.289> it's<00:01:21.470> heavier<00:01:21.860> than<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.610> 2

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
I like the unit it's heavier than the 2

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.580 
I like the unit it's heavier than the 2
stroke<00:01:23.180> unit<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.780> used<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.140> have<00:01:24.350> which

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
stroke unit that I used to have which

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.999 
stroke unit that I used to have which
was<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.979> curved<00:01:25.880> shaft<00:01:26.179> unit<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.440> got<00:01:27.979> a

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
was the curved shaft unit this is got a

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.190 
was the curved shaft unit this is got a
longer<00:01:28.369> reach<00:01:28.520> its<00:01:28.970> heavier<00:01:29.390> however<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
longer reach its heavier however the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.740 
longer reach its heavier however the
balancing<00:01:30.770> is<00:01:30.920> very<00:01:31.160> good<00:01:31.399> on<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.729> it's<00:01:32.509> easy

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
used before with great success because I

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.540 
used before with great success because I
have<00:01:37.580> something<00:01:37.940> was<00:01:38.090> like<00:01:38.209> a<00:01:38.240> 15<00:01:38.660> year<00:01:38.810> old

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.479 
it's hard on the string trimmer as far
as<00:02:08.179> actual<00:02:08.479> string<00:02:08.869> itself<00:02:09.500> wears<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.369> off

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
as actual string itself wears it off

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.680 
as actual string itself wears it off
fairly<00:02:10.759> fast<00:02:11.120> however

the<00:02:17.450> head<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:19.250> went<00:02:19.489> very<00:02:19.640> well<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:20.090> far<00:02:20.180> as

the<00:02:28.069> gas<00:02:28.720> reservoir<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.440> after<00:02:30.860> about<00:02:31.100> an

the gas reservoir this is after about an

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.010 
the gas reservoir this is after about an
hour's<00:02:31.640> worth<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:32.000> use<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.720> don't<00:02:32.810> know<00:02:32.930> if

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
hour's worth of use and I don't know if

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.870 
hour's worth of use and I don't know if
you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.260> see<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> video<00:02:34.130> or<00:02:34.340> not

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
you can see that in the video or not

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.480 
you can see that in the video or not
but<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.570> fuel<00:02:35.900> levels<00:02:36.290> about<00:02:36.800> right<00:02:37.280> in

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
but the the fuel levels about right in

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.930 
but the the fuel levels about right in
there

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
there

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.170 
there
so<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.750> hours<00:02:39.500> worth<00:02:39.710> of<00:02:39.890> use<00:02:40.130> we<00:02:40.760> were<00:02:40.820> able<00:02:41.000> to

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
so in hours worth of use we were able to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.530 
so in hours worth of use we were able to
get<00:02:41.710> just<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.830> half<00:02:43.040> tank<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.520> gas<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.060> because

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
get just a half tank of gas and because

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.540 
get just a half tank of gas and because
it's<00:02:44.690> four-stroke<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:46.040> don't<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.400> to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
it's four-stroke you don't have to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.550 
it's four-stroke you don't have to
premix<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.300> fuel<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.720> oil<00:02:48.020> because<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
premix the fuel with oil because the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.890 
premix the fuel with oil because the
lubrication<00:02:49.040> comes<00:02:49.520> from<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:50.060> very<00:02:50.540> small

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
lubrication comes from a very small

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.180 
lubrication comes from a very small
something<00:02:51.260> there<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.620> we<00:02:51.800> showed<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
something there that we showed on the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.700 
something there that we showed on the

off the unit what's running you don't

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.910 
off the unit what's running you don't
want<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.450> choke<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.810> out<00:03:11.960> or<00:03:12.170> do<00:03:12.260> anything<00:03:12.470> here

want to choke it out or do anything here

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.230 
want to choke it out or do anything here
you<00:03:13.070> would<00:03:13.190> just<00:03:13.220> leave<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.550> in<00:03:13.760> run<00:03:13.940> position

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
you would just leave it in run position

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.050 
you would just leave it in run position
let<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.140> return<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.650> idle<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.220> then<00:03:16.730> right

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
let it return to idle and then right

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.950 
let it return to idle and then right
over<00:03:17.090> here

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
over here

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.720 
over here
there's<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.470> switch<00:03:18.860> right<00:03:18.890> here<00:03:19.460> that<00:03:19.640> you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
there's a switch right here that you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.240 
there's a switch right here that you
would<00:03:19.850> just<00:03:20.000> push<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.510> notice<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:21.530> rocks<00:03:21.920> back

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
would just push and notice it rocks back

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.890 
would just push and notice it rocks back
once<00:03:22.550> you're<00:03:22.670> done<00:03:22.820> pushing<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.540> in<00:03:23.690> run

awkward<00:03:26.270> but<00:03:26.570> consider<00:03:27.200> where<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.800> on<00:03:28.010> the

to<00:04:38.389> 60<00:04:38.419> seconds<00:04:39.319> I<00:04:39.409> found<00:04:39.709> that<00:04:39.919> to<00:04:40.099> be<00:04:40.129> the

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:40.309 
to 60 seconds I found that to be the

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.029 
to 60 seconds I found that to be the
case<00:04:40.550> if<00:04:41.539> you<00:04:41.719> don't<00:04:41.869> let<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.139> warm<00:04:42.439> up<00:04:42.709> it'll

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
case if you don't let it warm up it'll

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.359 
case if you don't let it warm up it'll
stall<00:04:43.339> out<00:04:43.610> on<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:44.089> and<00:04:44.919> I'm<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:45.979> lousy

timekeeper in my brain I'll say 30

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:54.009 
timekeeper in my brain I'll say 30
seconds<00:04:49.339> okay<00:04:51.519> okay<00:04:52.519> that's<00:04:52.759> 30<00:04:53.089> seconds<00:04:53.689> well

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:54.019
