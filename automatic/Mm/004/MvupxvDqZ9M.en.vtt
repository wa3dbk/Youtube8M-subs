00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.070 

very<00:00:10.490> good<00:00:10.730> another<00:00:11.360> pattern<00:00:11.690> is<00:00:13.150> to<00:00:14.150> going

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
very good another pattern is to going

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.820 
very good another pattern is to going
outward<00:00:15.440> to<00:00:16.430> our<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.509> those<00:00:18.110> of<00:00:18.140> you<00:00:18.410> do<00:00:18.619> Tai

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
outward to our so those of you do Tai

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.760 
outward to our so those of you do Tai
Chi<00:00:18.860> recognize<00:00:19.730> this<00:00:20.720> basic<00:00:21.230> pattern<00:00:21.410> is

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
Chi recognize this basic pattern is

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.549 
Chi recognize this basic pattern is
waving<00:00:22.130> hands<00:00:22.340> like<00:00:22.610> clouds<00:00:26.259> but<00:00:27.259> it's<00:00:27.380> also

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:27.559 
waving hands like clouds but it's also

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.339 
waving hands like clouds but it's also
quite<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.369> few<00:00:28.700> other<00:00:28.910> movements<00:00:29.570> too<00:00:29.840> as<00:00:30.110> you

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
quite a few other movements too as you

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.470 
quite a few other movements too as you
see<00:00:30.800> us<00:00:30.980> we<00:00:31.189> open<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:31.939> sides<00:00:32.210> up<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:32.960> again

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
see us we open the sides up so again

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.880 
see us we open the sides up so again
it's<00:00:35.480> inside<00:00:36.410> we<00:00:36.830> have<00:00:37.070> this<00:00:37.250> these<00:00:37.790> waves

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
it's inside we have this these waves

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's inside we have this these waves
crashing<00:00:39.890> back<00:00:40.130> and<00:00:40.490> forth<00:00:42.130> around<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.790> belly

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.220 

and<00:00:49.100> open

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 

this<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.950> feels<00:00:53.190> particularly<00:00:53.730> natural<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this one feels particularly natural and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.680 
this one feels particularly natural and
good<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.710> maybe<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.400> of<00:00:56.880> Tai<00:00:57.239> Chi<00:00:57.510> we

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
good I think maybe because of Tai Chi we

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.470 
good I think maybe because of Tai Chi we
do<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.200> lot

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
do it a lot

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.890 
do it a lot
okay<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.540> stepping<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.200> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.470> left<00:01:01.650> foot

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.480 

so<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> becomes<00:01:07.500> quite<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.800> few<00:01:08.100> different

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so this becomes quite a few different

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
so this becomes quite a few different
things<00:01:08.729> course<00:01:09.390> clouds<00:01:09.720> hands<00:01:10.050> becomes<00:01:11.040> ward

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
things course clouds hands becomes ward

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:22.890 
things course clouds hands becomes ward
off

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.650 

and<00:01:24.090> pull<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.590> we<00:01:26.650> can<00:01:26.980> hear<00:01:27.640> we<00:01:27.790> can<00:01:27.970> pull<00:01:28.390> in

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
and pull now we can hear we can pull in

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.760 
and pull now we can hear we can pull in
both<00:01:28.870> directions<00:01:29.290> we<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:29.620> pull<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:31.260> pull<00:01:32.260> and

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
both directions we can pull and pull and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.310 
both directions we can pull and pull and
pull<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:34.120> pull<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.740> pull<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.790> pull<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:38.020> pull

can't pull and push pull and push pull
and<00:02:07.630> push<00:02:08.170> pull<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.610> push<00:02:10.030> or<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.360> other<00:02:10.510> way

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
and push pull and push or the other way

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.740 
and push pull and push or the other way
it's<00:02:11.160> pull<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.580> push<00:02:13.440> pull<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.800> push<00:02:15.750> pull

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750

it's pull and push pull and push pull
and<00:02:17.440> push<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.610> complete<00:02:19.060> different<00:02:19.630> set

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
and push it's a complete different set

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.310 
and push it's a complete different set
of<00:02:20.610> muscles<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.940> we<00:02:22.240> use<00:02:22.270> for<00:02:22.780> each<00:02:22.960> one<00:02:23.290> of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
of muscles that we use for each one of

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.620 
of muscles that we use for each one of
those<00:02:23.560> little<00:02:23.980> exercises<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.360> just

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
those little exercises it's just

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.380 
those little exercises it's just
somewhat<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.230> interesting<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.070> much<00:02:27.280> fun

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.810 

another<00:02:31.390> sign<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:36.010> Taiji<00:02:36.310> we<00:02:36.670> have

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
another sign you know in Taiji we have

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.090 
another sign you know in Taiji we have
the<00:02:36.970> same<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.420> energy<00:02:37.900> follows<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.890> mind

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
the same that energy follows the mind

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.790 
the same that energy follows the mind
you<00:02:39.670> know<00:02:39.820> what<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.270> think<00:02:40.660> we'll<00:02:41.050> that's<00:02:41.650> how

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
you know what you think we'll that's how

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.699 
you know what you think we'll that's how
the<00:02:41.860> energy<00:02:42.310> will<00:02:42.430> express<00:02:42.820> itself<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:44.290> we

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
the energy will express itself and so we

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.830 
the energy will express itself and so we
are<00:02:44.830> really<00:02:45.120> demonstrating<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.330> to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
are really demonstrating that to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.250 
are really demonstrating that to
ourselves<00:02:47.050> right<00:02:47.470> now<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:48.610> see<00:02:48.910> because<00:02:49.780> if

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
ourselves right now you see because if

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
ourselves right now you see because if
we<00:02:50.650> pull<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.610> pull<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.810> pull<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:54.040> pull<00:02:54.400> you

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
we pull and pull and pull and pull you

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.190 
we pull and pull and pull and pull you
just<00:02:55.209> feel<00:02:56.550> how<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.610> body<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.239> working<00:02:58.450> where

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
just feel how the body is working where

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.130 
just feel how the body is working where
is<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.890> emphasis<00:03:00.580> which<00:03:01.060> muscles<00:03:01.870> are

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
is the emphasis which muscles are

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.590 
is the emphasis which muscles are
working<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.550> make<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.180> movement<00:03:04.750> happen<00:03:06.600> my

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
working to make this movement happen my

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.759 
working to make this movement happen my
back<00:03:08.050> leg<00:03:08.500> my<00:03:08.860> front<00:03:09.459> leg<00:03:09.760> my<00:03:10.120> back<00:03:10.570> leg<00:03:10.989> front

movement or a pushing movement it's a

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.790 
movement or a pushing movement it's a
