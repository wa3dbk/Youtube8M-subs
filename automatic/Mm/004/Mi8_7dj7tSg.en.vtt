00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.290
 ok well what I come to teach 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:09.809
 is this roma custom is installed in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.290
 this 3000 well the mere truth of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.590
 this rom is very good for me I loved it 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.410
 this rom 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.570
 It has many things but the only bad thing is 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.490
 that has too many books I do not know if it's 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.990
 the version or I do not know what wave but but the 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.310
 it really causes me a lot of problems has 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.170
 too many books I had to eliminate 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.820
 many applications as you can see there 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.930
 I do not have many 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.900
 many applications with books and I had to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.960
 install them with a status of frob 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.010
 but this rom is good in itself and is very 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.579
 good I think it's very good is coal 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 equally his name is rooms 4.4 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.230
 point 4 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.230
 I really liked that they are 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.210
 the truth and I like scrap but I know 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.870
 that I'm going to have to install the install 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.870
 a new why 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.450
 that the truth if it causes me problems 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 because the moment is intent when 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.369
 I turn the phone off and on 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 I do not detect the phone or not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.979
 it produces calls because it does not give me a signal and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.350
 force saw of the saw and by the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.600
 close and that's how it is but the truth is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.210
 rom is very good I liked pretty 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 in what I've tried 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.760
 and well, it would be a matter of each 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.740
 who try this rom is tlc 3.000 no 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.700
 I'm sure if it's available for 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.650
 other android phones but well 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.720
 here is this rom you can leave them in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.430
 the description and remember that each 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.830
 who does what he wants with his phone 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.560
 I only leave the means and already 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.500
 you know if they approve or not 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 You see that here it is good and I have 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.340
 what to mention is that this rom as is 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 4.4 point 4 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.009
 de ma klaus has to be installed with 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.039
 the tvcp that that recovery that lighter 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.530
 recommends that you do not liquidate your 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.230
 cellular because the truth if it is blocked 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.340
 when you install it is a 4.4 point 4 with 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.410
 another advanced recovery 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.379
 Well, we do not want that to happen, so 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.740
 low in the recovery this I tell you and 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:27.460
 Well then that would be it not do 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.250
 recommended steps uip is to install the 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.040
 rom normally and that would be all for now 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.990
 well I send you a greeting and then you 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.580
 they want to try there I leave the means 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.650
 for you to do it but remember 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.510
 that everyone do so at your 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.840
 responsibility until next time 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.840
