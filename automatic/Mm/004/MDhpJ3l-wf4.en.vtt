00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.619 

now<00:02:40.329> let's<00:02:40.569> apply<00:02:41.349> some<00:02:41.379> minutes<00:02:41.829> of<00:02:41.980> my

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
now let's apply some minutes of my

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.489 
now let's apply some minutes of my
cousin's<00:02:43.629> on<00:02:43.749> the<00:02:43.900> sides<00:02:44.170> about<00:02:44.609> 82<00:02:45.609> minutes<00:02:45.849> I

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:46.499 
cousin's on the sides about 82 minutes I

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:52.199 
cousin's on the sides about 82 minutes I
gotta<00:02:48.060> get<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> gun<00:02:49.299> pulled<00:02:50.230> up<00:02:51.209> they

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
gotta get the gun pulled up they

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.440 
gotta get the gun pulled up they
immediately<00:02:52.810> started<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.249> know<00:02:54.609> you<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:58.420> a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
immediately started you know you like a

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:07.020 
immediately started you know you like a
guy<00:02:58.719> about<00:03:00.120> momentum

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:18.729 

heyo

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.820 

they<00:03:31.610> also<00:03:31.760> did<00:03:33.460> some<00:03:34.460> bleep<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:36.320> army<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.680> buy

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
they also did some bleep the army to buy

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.350 
they also did some bleep the army to buy
a<00:03:36.860> jacket

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.130 

Oh

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.010 

that's<00:03:44.740> a<00:03:44.890> taillight

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.690 

which<00:03:50.020> are<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.380> didn't<00:03:50.650> either

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
which are you didn't either

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.860 
which are you didn't either
again<00:03:52.360> even<00:03:52.599> that<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.980> has<00:03:54.160> momentum<00:03:54.569> in<00:03:55.569> order

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
again even that it has momentum in order

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.150 
again even that it has momentum in order
to<00:03:56.020> select<00:03:56.170> occlusion

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
to select occlusion

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.860 
to select occlusion
you<00:03:57.880> may<00:03:58.060> have<00:03:58.620> but<00:03:59.620> you
