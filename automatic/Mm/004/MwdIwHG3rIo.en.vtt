00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 if you want to lose weight a motivation is 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.600
 fundamental first link of success 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.330
 the joy continues is the most 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.330
 clear of wisdom 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.509
 and you always want me to motivate you from 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.680
 this television space feeds your life 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:36.460
 and here I am for that to transmitirte 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.839
 all my support and to try to motivate 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.089
 I want you to change your life in the 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.809
 case that is a person who has 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:49.120
 overweight or that you are obese has 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 present that the first pillar is the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.339
 motivation and that you will achieve 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 thinking about the treatment before you 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:04.059
 to follow and not do it suddenly 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.939
 motivated by some magical treatment 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.990
 that the only thing that will take you is to the 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:14.560
 frustration and you will achieve is to motivate you 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.070
 and leave the path that ultimately is 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.740
 the best thing that can happen because making 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.560
 a tedious diet what can you be 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.350
 predisposed is to contract diseases 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.600
 important and that can often be 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.840
 become reversible 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.270
 for that reason I propose that you 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.790
 stop for a moment and think about your 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.480
 lifetime 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 how good it would be that you now 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.250
 in more 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.370
 change your mind those thoughts that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.210
 they confuse you that they separate you from health 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.410
 and that ultimately make you very sad 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.180
 and many times away from people 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.780
 think about doing a treatment for 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.640
 lose weight does not mean starving the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.580
 fact is that I talked with a 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.890
 nutritionist with that professional who 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.540
 I support you so I can understand your 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:22.320
 problematic and that the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.450
 food according to the evolution that 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.010
 go presenting 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.860
 for that reason if you can understand that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.110
 to lose weight you do not have to think about 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.599
 deprivations but you have to educate yourself 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.930
 know how to choose all the foods that go 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.420
 to satisfy you and that they will not allow 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.569
 that is all day thinking to see what 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.030
 I can eat and that ultimately 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.310
 you are going to choose what separates you from the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.150
 health that are those cargo foods 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.260
 fats that take away your energy and that is 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.870
 so much the addiction that they produce you that is 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.190
 as a closed circle in which no 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.150
 you can let go 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.989
 then I got out of that situation 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:16.329
 put in your mind thoughts that you 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:19.850
 help to think about an effective process 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.060
 for your life in changes 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.540
 and those changes are not going to get you from 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.090
 one day for another you have patience 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.720
 think that you are a human being and that each 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.470
 one has its times and to the extent that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.010
 you manage to understand that no stumbles 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.320
 it means that you have lost the battle 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.370
 you will be able to progress in the process 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.160
 of weight loss but that yes with 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.350
 changes in eating behavior in the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.750
 lifestyle in those thoughts that 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.320
 you have to hinder them from working 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.170
 so that they are not impediments that your 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.720
 treatment is achieving the result 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.740
 what do you really need to increase your 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.970
 quality of life 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:17.350
 leave that old man behind 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.790
 I was born again with that jovial spirit of 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.520
 want to discover new paths of health 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.430
 here I am to help you but have 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.080
 present that there are many people who 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.520
 can help in this process I resorted to 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.879
 they 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.660
 and be happy do not think that the excess of 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:43.750
 weight gives you happiness because you do not have 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.659
 nothing to do with the mood if 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.409
 has to see why recognize their 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.449
 mistakes 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.840
 your fetters 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:57.779
 and start a good choice of 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.779
 treatment for your health 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:06.779
 very good to keep thinking about the past 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:10.409
 with sadness it is better to take a step 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.409
 smiling to life
