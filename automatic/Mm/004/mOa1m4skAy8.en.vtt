00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
 another order and repeat the drawing of a 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.860
 exactly the same as before 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.860
 a spiral 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.899
 there was a problem 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:19.359
 a goal if you do the drawing by the four ends you will have a fantastic margin 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.650
 like this 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.510
 and notice that it is very simple to do and gives a very good final touch to your 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.279
 drawing 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.810
 Now the only thing you need to do any design that is recorded in the 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.809
 template let's try some more look at this 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 once again place the template on top of the paper near the board now let's go 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 make a very simple stripes from top to bottom 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.630
 it does not seem at the end of the template 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.580
 let her be the one that stops you here 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.730
 and you're going to keep doing the same thing all over the edge b 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.100
 a goal 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.330
 when you have finished you will suffer credible frame with template like this 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.830
 look how simple it is 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 what do you think if we try more elaborate designs 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.460
 this time we are going to draw semicircles 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 as one within others 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
 yes this very well to give an emotional effect 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 min 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.040
 yes until the end of the template and so on all sides of the same paper 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.780
 shape 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 do not 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.190
 when you have finished the margins you will have something similar to this 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.920
 and it really gives the final touch not 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.740
 now you can make the margins that you want that you think the one that I put 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.590
 this greek drawing 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.620
 very classic no 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.500
 and you can also use other materials that you think of this little horse 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 of sea that frame it with silver marker 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.780
 it really gives another touch 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.680
 today you can even do it for your homework or your school work 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.880
 look at this poem 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 is much better with this margin that I put 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.469
 how about 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.689
 test your own margins with template 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:14.989
 and we're out of time
