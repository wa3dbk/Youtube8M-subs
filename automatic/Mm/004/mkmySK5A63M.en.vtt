00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.590
 Good morning , I'm Luiz Tomazzia . 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.849
 July the staff knows me more than 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.590
 thomas l 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.490
 and for several years by working.com 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.330
 In fact, I already had several children, but the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 objective is now to start a new kind of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 video is where I develop in the project 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 is a work a piece and where the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.680
 detail the entire run of this play the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.610
 that whoever comes to see this 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.920
 video can develop this same 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.309
 part is provided that the person has some 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.600
 machines and a little skill or 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.660
 at least the will to learn 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 It is obvious that the person is going to be 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.300
 able to play the piece so I go 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 show a little of my own 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:10.830
 for you as the work that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:13.070
 then back to speak to be good 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.350
 This is my workbench here. 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.320
 and lateral death to frontal death a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 works fine this law did not give there 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.220
 I have my saw tape a series of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.960
 40 that my bench line mlt a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.210
 breaking the branch for now but in 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.680
 dell series circular saw 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.850
 It's always good, you have a strong saw. 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.530
 which is the main tool of the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.439
 woodwork 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 there is also a bench with a lot of fighting 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.900
 on top of a spindle drill 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.490
 An emery is an auxiliary workbench. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:00.170
 I use it to store the tools, right? 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.409
 Easy bottle to hand here one 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.220
 thirty-two 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.440
 money is a 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.720
 she is small but she is not there 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.579
 You're going to come here soon and a bench here. 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.890
 from Tupi am 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.760
 It's right again to my bench then 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.730
 I work in a circle here 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.500
 is where I have all the tools to 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:34.790
 hand like I said I'm going to play a part 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:38.120
 and try to detail this so that the person 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.060
 watching the videos having the project in 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:48.739
 hands she can play this piece 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:52.069
 If this video right plan to give 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.099
 continuity to this series of videos with 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.569
 other projects that I have in mind 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.379
 so it 's a project that I'll detail 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:04.340
 today this bonsai table is a table 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.709
 she is 10 tall and has 30 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.139
 wide or 30 long by 20 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.930
 width 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:19.639
 here the side view gave is the view 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:21.190
 than the top then we have 20 per 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.269
 30 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.190
 Here I am going to do a little bit today. 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.690
 different but is a little different the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.329
 size but the principle is the same then 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.099
 detail that I want to draw attention to is 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.419
 just this one 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:42.560
 see that the foot has a box and 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:46.190
 triple treadmill in all directions 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.040
 Good, I'll call the other photo here. 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.480
 You'll see better. 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:57.040
 this detail here you can see her 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.449
 same power in this 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.889
 so why a month could triple 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.650
 in three directions 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:07.340
 she closes the month you do not see 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.940
 no wood stump here on snow face 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.900
 easy face easy easy easy does not appear 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.389
 wood stump 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.060
 besides we have one of the small 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.599
 thorns that serve on each of the feet 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.240
 which serves to fix the top 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:26.090
 Yeah, I'm Chinese, that's right. 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.400
 visually is not a snap like this 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.069
 complicated but I'll bring it here 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.930
 you see one thing 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:35.060
 op what apparently is a simple 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.759
 cut month a gang has ears for 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.759
 inside the looking over 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:52.250
 then inside and letting go even more 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.840
 see how it fits that tenon 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:02.949
 that gives all the support so that he does not 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.949
 slip away do not leave stay tight 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:13.280
 Okay, so I'm going from the project right now. 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.759
 show the project and then the choice 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.759
 of wood 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:26.539
 This is the design of the project in 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:27.319
 same height it has 10 centimeters 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.630
 tall 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:32.289
 The first thing I want to set is 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.690
 the height of the piece of each foot 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.940
 she is 10 cm tall, the top has two 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.710
 of thickness 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.110
 but it expires that it enters until half of 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.560
 time then 10 - 28 with more than half 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:51.740
 nine centimeters tall 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:53.949
 the piece from here until now I already have 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.949
 defined 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.150
 nine centimeters tall 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:09.690
 the width 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:12.210
 as I do not know yet why why I 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.940
 I do not know what wood I have for this. 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.970
 I always talk in carpentry I avoid 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.919
 make a very detailed project because a 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.449
 assumes that it defines its width 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.729
 six centimeters 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.110
 I get the piece I have here. 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.629
 use is only five 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.419
 and I'll leave it there, I 'll leave it 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:34.009
 do because she has five not if I 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:41.639
 can adapt without pb harmony of the project 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:45.599
 I adapt so I need to define this 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:49.229
 this width of the foot because it eats only 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:53.129
 which at a rate of 6 squares the width 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:56.669
 will also set the width 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:59.190
 work with wood in 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:00.569
 different heights I will not be able to use 45 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.360
 degrees - gang 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:07.710
 so how do you want to use 45 degrees the width 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:11.699
 of the foot will define the width of the crosspiece 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:16.729
 It's okay then to select wood that I 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.729
 I have and let's define this 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.909
 this one is going to be the end result 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:23.849
 of this project 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:28.050
