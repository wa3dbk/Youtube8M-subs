00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
have to build an entire subframe we have

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.200 
have to build an entire subframe we have
to<00:05:19.409> reinforce<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.069> roof<00:05:20.279> we<00:05:20.969> have<00:05:21.090> to

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
to reinforce the roof we have to

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.379 
to reinforce the roof we have to
reinforce<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.870> floor<00:05:22.139> we<00:05:22.439> have<00:05:22.469> a<00:05:22.680> lot<00:05:23.069> of

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
reinforce the floor we have a lot of

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.879 
reinforce the floor we have a lot of
design<00:05:24.389> work<00:05:24.419> involved<00:05:25.080> in<00:05:25.199> doing<00:05:25.319> this<00:05:25.620> so

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
design work involved in doing this so

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.040 
design work involved in doing this so
our<00:05:26.520> videos<00:05:26.939> are<00:05:27.120> gonna<00:05:27.210> slow<00:05:27.539> down<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:27.990> just
