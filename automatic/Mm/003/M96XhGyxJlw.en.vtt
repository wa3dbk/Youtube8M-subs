00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
humbuckers if you have really high

it'll<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:13.259> tougher<00:01:13.680> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it'll be a little bit tougher just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
it'll be a little bit tougher just
because<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> tone<00:01:14.580> has<00:01:15.149> real<00:01:15.479> open<00:01:15.960> bitey

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
because that tone has real open bitey

quality to it in the recording and it's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
quality to it in the recording and it's
hard<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.690> when<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.500> pickups<00:01:19.920> are

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040

hard to do that when your pickups are
pushing<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> amp<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.790> hard<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.420> maybe<00:01:21.570> roll

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pushing the amp so hard so maybe roll

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.969 
pushing the amp so hard so maybe roll

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
guitar sound like that's it it's just

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.020 
guitar sound like that's it it's just
nailed<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.690> box<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.920> I'll<00:02:16.340> turn<00:02:16.850> on

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
nailed it in a box and so I'll turn on

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.650 
nailed it in a box and so I'll turn on
just<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.520> basically<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.670> tape<00:02:19.880> head<00:02:20.120> side<00:02:20.480> of

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
just the basically the tape head side of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.420 
just the basically the tape head side of
it<00:02:20.780> which<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.380> proposal<00:02:21.980> old<00:02:22.190> tape

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
it which is this is a proposal old tape

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.920 
it which is this is a proposal old tape
machine<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> left<00:02:23.180> side<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.420> your<00:02:23.750> tape

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
machine so the left side is your tape

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.020 
machine so the left side is your tape
saturation<00:02:24.200> your<00:02:25.040> right<00:02:25.220> side<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> actual

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
saturation your right side is the actual

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.240 
saturation your right side is the actual
machine<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:26.990> can<00:02:27.200> spread<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.770> tape<00:02:27.980> heads

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
machine so you can spread the tape heads

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.490 
machine so you can spread the tape heads
out<00:02:28.490> with<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> lag<00:02:29.390> time<00:02:29.420> all<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.200> way<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
out with the lag time all the way to the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.900 
out with the lag time all the way to the
right<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.860> most<00:02:31.040> lag<00:02:31.280> time<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:31.880> a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
right the most lag time you get like a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.730 
right the most lag time you get like a
slap<00:02:32.180> back<00:02:32.390> delay<00:02:32.420> all<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.320> way<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> left

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
slap back delay all the way to the left

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.410 
slap back delay all the way to the left
you<00:02:34.070> go<00:02:34.220> through<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.550> zero<00:02:34.760> point<00:02:34.970> start<00:02:35.330> to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
you go through the zero point start to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.360 
you go through the zero point start to
get<00:02:35.540> really<00:02:35.780> cool<00:02:35.959> chorusing<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.770> flange

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
get really cool chorusing and flange

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.040 
get really cool chorusing and flange
encountered

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.050 

really<00:02:45.050> awesome<00:02:45.230> really<00:02:46.129> awesome<00:02:46.250> kind<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:46.909> in

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
really awesome really awesome kind of in

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.759 
really awesome really awesome kind of in
between<00:02:47.150> flange<00:02:47.720> course<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.290> settings<00:02:48.620> I'm

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
between flange course the settings I'm

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.070 
between flange course the settings I'm
using<00:02:48.980> are<00:02:49.250> about<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.480> don't<00:02:50.659> know<00:02:50.840> where<00:02:50.989> this

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
using are about I don't know where this

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.350 
using are about I don't know where this
is<00:02:51.170> 11<00:02:51.530> o'clock<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.159> leg<00:02:52.340> knob<00:02:52.640> we've<00:02:53.239> got

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
is 11 o'clock on the leg knob we've got

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.910 
is 11 o'clock on the leg knob we've got
the<00:02:53.450> blend<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.870> little<00:02:54.110> less<00:02:54.260> than<00:02:54.470> half<00:02:54.530> I

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the blend a little less than half I

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.440 
the blend a little less than half I
don't<00:02:54.950> want<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.250> be<00:02:55.340> too<00:02:55.549> overpowered<00:02:56.239> with

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
don't want to be too overpowered with

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.479 
don't want to be too overpowered with
the<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.110> chorus<00:02:57.500> flange<00:02:57.799> sound<00:02:58.129> so<00:02:58.340> it's

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
the the chorus flange sound so it's

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.150 
the the chorus flange sound so it's
about<00:02:58.670> again<00:02:59.269> around<00:02:59.480> 11<00:02:59.840> o'clock<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.680> wobble

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
about again around 11 o'clock the wobble

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.430 
about again around 11 o'clock the wobble
which<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.549> actual<00:03:02.060> extremity<00:03:03.019> of<00:03:03.049> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
which is the actual extremity of the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.070 
which is the actual extremity of the
modulation<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.459> tape<00:03:04.700> itself<00:03:05.180> or<00:03:06.019> just

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
modulation of the tape itself or just

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.280 
modulation of the tape itself or just
like<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.950> intensity<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.390> flange<00:03:08.900> sound

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
like the intensity of the flange sound

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.750 
like the intensity of the flange sound
is<00:03:09.470> with<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.010> wobble<00:03:10.280> knob<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.489> doing<00:03:10.670> some

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
is with the wobble knob is doing some

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.030 
is with the wobble knob is doing some
kind<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.000> wobble<00:03:11.299> set<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.599> around<00:03:12.019> one<00:03:12.890> o'clock

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
kind of wobble set it around one o'clock

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.890 
kind of wobble set it around one o'clock
so<00:03:13.489> there's<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:14.450> bit<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.599> movement

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
so there's a little bit of movement

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.360 
so there's a little bit of movement
enough<00:03:15.349> to<00:03:15.470> be<00:03:15.530> noticeable<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:18.040> we<00:03:19.040> are<00:03:19.129> using

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
enough to be noticeable and we are using

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.420 
enough to be noticeable and we are using
the<00:03:19.790> bounce<00:03:20.150> setting<00:03:20.660> which<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.010> bottom

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
the bounce setting which is the bottom

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.339 
the bounce setting which is the bottom
on<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:23.030> 3-way<00:03:23.209> toggle<00:03:23.750> switch<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.079> then

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
on a little 3-way toggle switch and then

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.229 
on a little 3-way toggle switch and then
I'm<00:03:24.799> using<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.340> little<00:03:25.370> bit<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.849> drive<00:03:26.090> from

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
I'm using a little bit of the drive from

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.460 
I'm using a little bit of the drive from
the<00:03:26.329> deco<00:03:26.540> because<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.140> beautiful

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
the deco because it's a beautiful

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.670 
the deco because it's a beautiful
sounding<00:03:28.480> really<00:03:29.480> nice<00:03:29.840> overdrive<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.530> get

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
sounding really nice overdrive you get

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.470 
sounding really nice overdrive you get
from<00:03:30.829> this<00:03:30.950> unit<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.670> here's<00:03:31.849> what<00:03:32.000> our<00:03:32.030> clean

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
from this unit so here's what our clean

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.680 
from this unit so here's what our clean
is<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:34.310> we're<00:03:34.400> putting<00:03:34.519> on<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.450> tape

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
is then we're putting on the tape

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.770 
is then we're putting on the tape
saturation

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.960 

really<00:03:42.780> nice<00:03:43.050> even<00:03:43.830> harmonics<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.610> smooth

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
really nice even harmonics it's smooth

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.090 
really nice even harmonics it's smooth
it's<00:03:45.270> not<00:03:45.450> overly<00:03:45.959> aggressive<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:46.890> just

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
it's not overly aggressive and it just

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.010 
it's not overly aggressive and it just
seems<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.700> lend<00:03:47.819> itself<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.300> this<00:03:48.420> tone<00:03:48.690> really

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
seems to lend itself to this tone really

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.410 
seems to lend itself to this tone really
well<00:03:49.170> then

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.850 

it's<00:03:55.420> got<00:03:55.569> just<00:03:55.780> enough<00:03:55.959> Drive<00:03:56.380> for<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.680> nose

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
it's got just enough Drive for the nose

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.280 
it's got just enough Drive for the nose
to<00:03:56.890> grab<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:58.209> could<00:03:58.360> still<00:03:58.599> clearly<00:03:59.080> hear<00:03:59.260> the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
to grab you could still clearly hear the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.900 
to grab you could still clearly hear the
chorusing<00:03:59.830> effect<00:03:59.890> happening<00:04:00.520> you<00:04:00.580> can<00:04:00.700> nail

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
chorusing effect happening you can nail

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.809 
chorusing effect happening you can nail
a<00:04:01.180> lot<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.750> those<00:04:01.989> like<00:04:02.680> late<00:04:02.920> 70s<00:04:03.550> kind<00:04:03.730> of

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
a lot of those like late 70s kind of

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.710 
a lot of those like late 70s kind of
classic<00:04:04.390> rush<00:04:04.750> era<00:04:05.080> tones<00:04:05.610> with<00:04:06.610> just<00:04:06.880> one<00:04:07.480> box
