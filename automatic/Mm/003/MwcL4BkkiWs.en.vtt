00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
this year because the Leafs have just

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.180 
this year because the Leafs have just
been<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:49.780> relying<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.380> goaltending<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.069> it's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
point saying it but the goalie has one

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.089 
point saying it but the goalie has one
job<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.929> you<00:01:56.020> might<00:01:56.200> be<00:01:56.319> saying<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.679> that<00:01:56.830> stop
