00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
apart for parts I'm actually gonna use

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.610 
apart for parts I'm actually gonna use
the<00:00:31.700> Dodge<00:00:31.880> Ram<00:00:32.119> body<00:00:32.450> on<00:00:32.780> my<00:00:33.260> light<00:00:33.410> Hawk

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
the Dodge Ram body on my light Hawk

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.310 
the Dodge Ram body on my light Hawk
brute<00:00:33.890> if<00:00:34.010> I<00:00:34.100> can<00:00:34.250> make<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:34.520> fit<00:00:34.989> anyway<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.050> I

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
brute if I can make it fit anyway so I

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.889 
brute if I can make it fit anyway so I
thought<00:00:38.620> let's<00:00:39.620> see<00:00:39.800> if<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.040> tires<00:00:40.309> can<00:00:40.940> go

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
thought let's see if the tires can go

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.270 
thought let's see if the tires can go
across<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.269> turns<00:00:44.510> out<00:00:44.749> the<00:00:45.499> rims<00:00:45.769> will

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
across and it turns out the rims will

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.889 
across and it turns out the rims will
mount<00:00:46.579> without<00:00:47.149> any<00:00:47.510> problem<00:00:48.050> on<00:00:48.399> to<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.059> wolf

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
mount without any problem on to the wolf

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.569 
mount without any problem on to the wolf
Pro<00:00:51.550> but<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:53.629> make<00:00:53.839> things<00:00:54.079> work<00:00:54.379> properly<00:00:54.710> is

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
Pro but to make things work properly is

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.910 
Pro but to make things work properly is
gonna<00:00:55.850> require<00:00:56.089> some<00:00:56.870> carving<00:00:57.409> of<00:00:57.589> the<00:00:57.620> body

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
gonna require some carving of the body

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
do would be to start right along that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.850 
do would be to start right along that
wheel<00:01:16.040> flare<00:01:16.460> remove<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.659> area<00:01:18.110> first<00:01:18.530> and
