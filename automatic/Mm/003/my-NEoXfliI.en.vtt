then I was just like feeling it and i'm
using<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.190> diablo<00:05:08.729> which<00:05:08.880> is<00:05:09.030> submachine<00:05:09.599> gun

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
using the diablo which is submachine gun

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.250 
using the diablo which is submachine gun
and<00:05:10.080> i<00:05:11.120> like<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.330> but<00:05:12.479> i<00:05:12.539> like<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.870> fact<00:05:12.900> the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
and i like it but i like the fact the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.589 
and i like it but i like the fact the
super<00:05:13.590> beat<00:05:13.740> which<00:05:14.099> is<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.340> vector<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:15.389> looks

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
super beat which is the vector it looks

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.150 
super beat which is the vector it looks
just<00:05:15.690> like<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.229> know<00:05:16.320> it's<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.530> MW<00:05:16.979> two

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
just like you know it's the MW two

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
just like you know it's the MW two
vectors<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.760> looks<00:05:17.970> ain't<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.419> um<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:20.280> yeah

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
vectors it looks ain't it um so yeah

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.700 
vectors it looks ain't it um so yeah
right<00:05:21.449> there<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:21.960> then<00:05:22.020> from<00:05:22.289> there<00:05:22.349> was

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
right there and then from there was

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.740 
right there and then from there was
pretty<00:05:23.400> much<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.580> wrap<00:05:23.880> like<00:05:24.210> we<00:05:24.389> won<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.720> first

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
pretty much a wrap like we won the first

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.870 
pretty much a wrap like we won the first
side<00:05:25.199> and<00:05:25.500> push<00:05:25.680> them<00:05:25.860> back<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.400> then<00:05:26.520> if<00:05:26.760> you

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
side and push them back and then if you

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.969 
side and push them back and then if you
see<00:05:27.090> if<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:27.389> saw<00:05:27.599> on<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.930> overhead<00:05:28.410> just<00:05:28.800> keep

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
see if you saw on the overhead just keep

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.560 
see if you saw on the overhead just keep
watching<00:05:29.130> over<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:29.760> see<00:05:29.970> we<00:05:30.120> hadn't<00:05:30.419> pushed

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
watching over you see we hadn't pushed

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.629 
watching over you see we hadn't pushed
into<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.020> corner<00:05:31.440> there<00:05:31.949> was<00:05:32.099> no<00:05:32.250> getting<00:05:32.430> out

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
into the corner there was no getting out

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.790 
into the corner there was no getting out
for<00:05:32.880> them<00:05:33.030> so<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.539> just<00:05:33.780> we<00:05:34.229> just<00:05:34.440> went<00:05:34.650> on

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
for them so I just we just went on

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.830 
for them so I just we just went on
tearing<00:05:35.430> them<00:05:35.520> up<00:05:35.669> with<00:05:35.970> our<00:05:36.090> street<00:05:36.449> with<00:05:36.750> our

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
tearing them up with our street with our

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.710 
tearing them up with our street with our
kill<00:05:37.080> streaks<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.210> everything<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.479> think

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
kill streaks and and everything I think

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.270 
kill streaks and and everything I think
I<00:05:39.810> was<00:05:39.930> using<00:05:40.110> a<00:05:40.349> I<00:05:40.680> was<00:05:40.860> using<00:05:40.979> a<00:05:41.130> white
