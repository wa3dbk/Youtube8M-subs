secure with bobby pins and just adding
one<00:02:01.810> in<00:02:01.930> there<00:02:02.080> because<00:02:02.290> there<00:02:02.440> was<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:02.680> a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
one in there because there was like a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.499 
one in there because there was like a
little<00:02:02.979> blump<00:02:03.550> in<00:02:03.729> there<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.149> did<00:02:04.360> not
