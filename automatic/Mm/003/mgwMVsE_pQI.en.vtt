00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
interesting is the simple fact that

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.180 
interesting is the simple fact that
think<00:03:46.790> about<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.180> if<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.230> didn't<00:03:48.560> walk<00:03:48.800> there

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
think about it if I didn't walk there

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.479 
think about it if I didn't walk there

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
months do you think that people would

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.530 
months do you think that people would

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
you have to do things over and over and

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.860 
you have to do things over and over and
over<00:04:37.050> again<00:04:37.550> that's<00:04:38.550> how<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:38.970> get<00:04:39.240> great<00:04:39.720> at

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
something not by doing something once

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.170 
something not by doing something once
people<00:04:42.930> don't<00:04:43.289> remember<00:04:43.710> well<00:04:44.460> depending<00:04:45.060> on

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180

people don't remember well depending on
what<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.479> is<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.870> guess<00:04:45.930> there's<00:04:46.289> a<00:04:46.350> few

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
what it is I guess there's a few

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.150 
what it is I guess there's a few
scenarios<00:04:47.430> out<00:04:48.030> there<00:04:48.330> but<00:04:48.780> overall<00:04:49.199> it's

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
scenarios out there but overall it's

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.100 
scenarios out there but overall it's
that<00:04:50.430> consistency<00:04:51.270> of<00:04:51.479> somebody<00:04:51.930> doing

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
that consistency of somebody doing

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.020 
that consistency of somebody doing
something<00:04:52.620> over<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.100> over<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.580> over<00:04:53.940> again

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
something over and over and over again

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.170 
something over and over and over again
and<00:04:54.560> sometimes<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.370> craziest<00:04:56.910> things

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
and sometimes it's the craziest things

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.840 
and sometimes it's the craziest things
it's<00:04:57.449> not<00:04:57.600> even<00:04:58.220> something<00:04:59.220> that's<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.639> mean<00:04:59.729> it

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
it's not even something that's I mean it

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.969 
it's not even something that's I mean it
can<00:04:59.970> be<00:05:00.000> good<00:05:00.330> bad<00:05:00.630> or<00:05:00.660> indifferent<00:05:00.900> but<00:05:01.830> that

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
can be good bad or indifferent but that

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.370 
can be good bad or indifferent but that
person<00:05:02.639> you<00:05:03.000> know<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.360> guys<00:05:03.539> are<00:05:03.600> on<00:05:03.840> Facebook

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.180 
or whatever it is you've got that person
you<00:05:06.900> might<00:05:07.050> even<00:05:07.199> complain<00:05:07.710> about<00:05:07.889> them

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
you might even complain about them

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.650 
you might even complain about them
because<00:05:08.430> they're<00:05:08.580> always<00:05:08.729> driving<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.479> nuts

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
because they're always driving you nuts

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.930 
because they're always driving you nuts

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
but it's because they consistently do

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.420 
but it's because they consistently do
something<00:05:12.479> over<00:05:12.960> and<00:05:13.289> over<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.949> over<00:05:14.310> again

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
something over and over and over again

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.820 
something over and over and over again
and<00:05:14.760> then<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.180> talk<00:05:15.570> about<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.960> if<00:05:16.410> they<00:05:16.620> only

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
and then you talk about it if they only

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.890 
and then you talk about it if they only
posted<00:05:17.310> something<00:05:17.580> once<00:05:18.090> every<00:05:18.539> six<00:05:18.810> months

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
posted something once every six months

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.089
