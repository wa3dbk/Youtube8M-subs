00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.859
 80-year history of All-Russian Research Institute 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.349
 sheep and goat in times 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.509
 USSR edge called the main sheepfold 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.740
 countries over the years the scientist have achieved 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 great success 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.660
 dozens of new breeds were created over 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.300
 this task worked the best minds of one 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.189
 sixth of the earth after 13 years 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.109
 All-Russian Research Institute of Sheep and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.119
 goat breeding return their positions 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.650
 this decision was recently made 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.869
 federal agency of scientific 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.489
 organizations of St. Petersburg entrepreneur 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.829
 Oleg Swan also passed his 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.550
 the unique way of creating your own 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.370
 breeds of sheep 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 It took him nearly 20 years to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.870
 the animals in his household became 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.210
 unique about the challenges of launching a new 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.670
 meat breed sheep tell Alexey 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.309
 malahin for their sheep or fortify 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.469
 meets the cowboy hat and with a smile on 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 face he zahleb tells about his 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.420
 animals that calls 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.129
 the best among sheep meat 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 many years ago Oleg put in front 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.519
 is a task to create a breed of meat which 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.189
 would be better than the available breeds 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.159
 the first thing he refused to receive 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.610
 wool wool and high quality and tasty and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.189
 meat two things incompatible 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.430
 quality wool it should be 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.890
 the good 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.080
 glands that give a lot of lanolin 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.409
 which lubricates this wool and at the same 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.159
 while the same lanolin spoils its meat 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.890
 the smell 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.890
 as if by taste itself 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.619
 the breeding process to the fog sheep exactly 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.579
 so called new breed was long and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.000
 uneasy 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.009
 we crossed Romanov sheep with 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.950
 american laying shorts about you 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.899
 strange breeds katadyn then hybrids 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.259
 first generation f1 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.290
 we crossed again with the breed rams 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.040
 katadyn only other lines not 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.200
 closely related and so by 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.100
 absorption cross 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.640
 conversion absorber 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.570
 crossing we are trying to get new 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.879
 the breed of smooth-haired of my sheep on 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.370
 the farm does not understand who is wrong 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.690
 standing still here to failure 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.910
 they are a 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.920
 worn philosophically failed now 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.130
 next time the result is required 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.350
 will meet all the expectations of errors such 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.370
 which can not be fixed we do not happen 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.100
 and here is an error on us worth 2 3 years if 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.350
 you are mistaken in some way here 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.470
 this call send all this direction 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.400
 on the meat and start again again as if with 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.010
 other sheep 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.320
 Oleg remembers at the beginning of his journey 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.080
 literally had to spend day and 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.540
 stay overnight with lambs and sheep in coils 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.200
 today it only comes in rough 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.380
 next to him all the flock bleat all but not from 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.170
 hunger for joy meeting by the way feed 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.830
 household requirements increased if 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.190
 hay 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.070
 environmentally grown grown and beveled 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.920
 in the wild fields because if you plant 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.260
 here are some cultural things you need to know 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.900
 what seeds that it is worn and everything and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.600
 Only here as if to the dean really 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.860
 environmentally friendly that it's a 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.480
 green 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.690
 quality and dried is the main 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.780
 food for our sheep one sheep for the winter 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.820

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.280
 animals also salt lizunets 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.830
 enriched with vitamins and constantly 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.900
 drinking bowl filled with water and after lambing 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.510
 so that the animal quickly gained strength 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.300
 he, as a child, is given the floor vitamins 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.170
 kilograms of feed so on 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.239
 Sheep farm exactly fed farmer 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.030

 much less but Oleg swan sure is 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.880
