00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.789
 distributes to the north of our territory 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.860
 we will expect rainfall in the greater 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.170
 part of the Mexican geography where 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.870
 Rainfalls that go from

 the yucatan peninsula will be 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.019
 precipitations that are directed 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.149
 occasionally moderate and some 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.769
 points of the north will also moderate the

 precipitation as they can be in sound 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.000
 and even in sinaloa almost all the

 in some points they can be accompanied 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.870
 of activity electrical activity we can 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.700
 also mention 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.400
 the conditions of the temperatures for 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.000

 biggest change the sunny clean morning 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.270
 go to the remaining quality and for the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.510
 late and at the social temperatures between 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.760
 40 and 42 degrees the maximum and in the 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.930
 middle part in the sky will remain the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.730
 partly cloudy cloudy with a 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.350
 moderate to heavy rainfall 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.050
 temperatures that can reach up to 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.240
 30 to 32 degrees and even up to 35 in 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.070
 some points of these states in the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.450
 south of the pacific we also follow 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.640
 getting enough moisture 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.410
 abundant rainfall activity 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.670
 electrical and temperatures oscillate 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.440
 but you are 29 32 or 64 degrees in 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.360
 the southern pacific of the peninsula 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.250
 Yucatan we will wait a little less than 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.110
 new city than in the rest of the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.730
 x regions we lose from light 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.710
 Nationally moderate precipitation 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.720
 temperatures and make the 34 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.340
 there are even the 38 degrees 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.440
 temperature for what is Campeche 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.330
 Yucatan and the show of Quintana Roo in the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.040
 gulf of mexico precipitations that go 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.230
 of moderate occasionally with strong 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.530
 temperatures that are reaching 36 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.050
 degrees 34 36 temperatures and with some 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.270
 rain in these three states remain expensive 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.910
 the gulf of mexico on the north table 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.870
 also some cloudiness that is going to 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.430
 increase in the afternoon and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.230
 precipitation that we have already indicated 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.640
 in the places where there may be 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.160
 precipitation even strong with 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.630
 temperatures from hot to hot in 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.090
 everything that is the north of the country to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.250
 center we will be in an environment of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.110
 warm to almost hot because 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.420
 we will also hope that lan a city 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.120
 can have enough energy to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.070
 be generated after noon and give us 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.990
 heavy rainfall for all 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.700
 states of the center of the republic 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.550
 mexicana in the city ​​of mexico this 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.080
 Thursday Friday and Saturday we will wait 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.060
 temperatures that go between 25 a 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.890
 the 26 degrees 6 the maximum to the minimum 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.290
 from 12 to 14 the sky is partly cloudy

 Cloudy with afternoon rainfall 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.970
 and night in the city of mexico is the most 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.020
 important that we have to you is of
