00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.930
 I would like to introduce people 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.260
 First of all 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:17.840
 The main premise is to have an array table 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.840
 It is intended to refer Well this is a sequence listing 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.610
 Yes 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:29.380
 As video this time 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.380
 Since I sent 25 bot missions, I will start with that introduction 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.480
 This is 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.480
 Okugawa cylinder 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.060
 Here Yes you know it is the front side cylinder 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.220
 Here a 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.030
 Call this b 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.050
 th 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.050
 First is from a 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.570
 There is a next 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.570
 is b 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.430
 Yes 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.340
 Now it was a 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.340
 Please remember the super rare campaign 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.080
 I think that I want to describe who the view of the array 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.310
 Here is entered 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.580
 Well here is one set of 10 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.710
 The contents of this one set are decided and super rare degree rare 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.960
 ct is fixed 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.580
 Now chasing yourself anywhere in the column if you look at the super rare campaign to discharge discrete to the brim 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 I know how 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.810
 It looks like this 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.060
 It is a little old days array 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.390
 I read like this 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.370
 But this time, the previous discharge result is yes 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.060
 If you can not confirm 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:40.350
 I hope you can see the Diet 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.550
 Where did you dig when you gave 25 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.550
 To introduce 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.440
 It is this column 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.799
 r 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.799
 Do you understand? 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.130

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.220

 It is a high-quality boy group 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.220
 Tiered Doria 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.540
 Yabejiton 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.629
 It's a fair day g 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.629
 I will go beyond the column I'm digging now 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.580
 I have it 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.580
 It is a cylinder of this side 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.650
 A little nice to the light 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.530
 Tsukare-play essentials ge 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:48.110
 Bobbidi via Goku boyhood of Rear 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.450
 Atochotto adviser has shifted but will not go and want hurts 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.890
 The jerk 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.220
 Sweet potato 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.890
 It is in the minute department 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.010
 It is also not match of course need to breath 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.110
 I'm doing this now I wonder where I stand now 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:09.390
 I will look for 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:11.090
 It may not be as the arrangement of the teak letter Mercer 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.690
 Please note 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.519
 How to put in this hand 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.819
 In the form 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:25.240
 It is better not to be a genius but 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:29.550
 Please be Toka get to close friends 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.550
 It is also a way of cylinder reason 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.920
 It is that there is not a discharge port at the Cala 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.360
 In the card outlet that was smashed 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.360
 Good card from there 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.930
 From 2 of Pirapira 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.950
 I say this and pro 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.330
 I guess it's coming in 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.240
 It is a job of judgment of a and b at this time 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.340
 The clothes here 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.389
 Entered at the base of the part 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.389
 Give the 2 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.230
 Seeing only the first joint from above 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.900
 Make it visible and bend like this 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.770
 It is a picture seen from above Mako 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.680
 And then it fell the card doing this 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.370
 Face injury lightly Luke hit the front side 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:30.720
 And solder Te 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:36.990
 It's roughly now , but you should be able to roughly judge with this 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:42.689
 I may decide to stand vertically or horizontally, but I'm basically doing this 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:48.169
 Hold your hand on 2 and bend your body a little 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:54.439
 The cylinder on the front side or the cylinder of Okigawa can be identified 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:56.790
 If you compare this well with the technology of this technology technology cylinder reason and enter the tee 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:06:00.720
 Pearl pin clear c good 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:04.340
 I think Matthias will double 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.120
 Well it's a little longer now 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.120
 Thank you very much
