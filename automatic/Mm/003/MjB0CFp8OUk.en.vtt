00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
trying to figure out building techniques

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.589 
trying to figure out building techniques
came<00:00:12.450> up<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.900> own<00:00:12.929> design<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.570> opted<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
came up with my own design and opted to

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.380 
came up with my own design and opted to
use<00:00:15.929> 1<00:00:16.650> by<00:00:16.680> 12<00:00:17.039> pine<00:00:17.430> boards<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.060> sides

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
use 1 by 12 pine boards with the sides

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.599 
use 1 by 12 pine boards with the sides
and<00:00:19.220> I<00:00:20.220> used<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.119> quarter<00:00:21.510> inch<00:00:21.720> sheet<00:00:22.260> of

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
and I used a quarter inch sheet of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.980 
and I used a quarter inch sheet of
marine<00:00:23.609> plywood<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.449> top<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.960> bottom

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
marine plywood for the top and bottom

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.550 
marine plywood for the top and bottom
one<00:00:25.529> sheet<00:00:26.660> joined<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.750> together<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.260> bronze

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
one sheet joined it together with bronze

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800 
one sheet joined it together with bronze
ring<00:00:28.830> shank<00:00:29.099> nails<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.359> between<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
ring shank nails and in between the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.130 
ring shank nails and in between the
joints<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.260> used<00:00:32.000> epoxy<00:00:33.000> resin<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.510> also<00:00:33.840> covered

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the whole thing with the resin and just

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.600 
the whole thing with the resin and just
to<00:00:36.540> keep<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> cost<00:00:36.989> down<00:00:37.140> that's<00:00:37.950> all<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> did<00:00:38.399> I
