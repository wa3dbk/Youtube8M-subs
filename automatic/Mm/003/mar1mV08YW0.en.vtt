00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.980 

yesterday<00:00:07.700> we<00:00:08.090> had<00:00:08.299> someone<00:00:08.660> bringing<00:00:08.870> a

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
yesterday we had someone bringing a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.810 
yesterday we had someone bringing a
sample<00:00:09.379> of<00:00:09.469> bull's<00:00:09.860> eye<00:00:10.129> for<00:00:10.429> me<00:00:10.519> to<00:00:10.579> grasp

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
sample of bull's eye for me to grasp

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.909 
sample of bull's eye for me to grasp
from<00:00:11.059> a<00:00:11.120> sports<00:00:11.419> field<00:00:11.690> that<00:00:12.499> the<00:00:12.650> symptoms

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:12.919 
from a sports field that the symptoms

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.430 
from a sports field that the symptoms
didn't<00:00:13.459> look<00:00:13.610> quite<00:00:13.820> right<00:00:13.940> for<00:00:14.209> the<00:00:14.809> leaf

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
didn't look quite right for the leaf

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.190 
didn't look quite right for the leaf
spot<00:00:15.709> disease<00:00:15.740> such<00:00:16.280> as<00:00:16.420> by<00:00:17.420> Polaris<00:00:17.780> leaf

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
spot disease such as by Polaris leaf

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.170 
spot disease such as by Polaris leaf
spot<00:00:18.530> so<00:00:19.160> we<00:00:19.280> put<00:00:19.460> it<00:00:19.550> in<00:00:19.640> an<00:00:19.760> incubation

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
spot so we put it in an incubation

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.990 
spot so we put it in an incubation
chamber<00:00:21.310> overnight<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.580> here's<00:00:23.120> what<00:00:23.270> we<00:00:23.360> saw

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.240 

you<00:00:29.000> can<00:00:29.120> see<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.450> very<00:00:30.440> clearly<00:00:30.770> the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
you can see the very clearly the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.180 
you can see the very clearly the
mycelium<00:00:31.760> heavy<00:00:32.119> mycelium<00:00:32.720> all<00:00:33.650> over<00:00:34.070> the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
mycelium heavy mycelium all over the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.390 
mycelium heavy mycelium all over the
sample<00:00:34.430> which<00:00:35.390> we're<00:00:36.290> gonna<00:00:36.350> find<00:00:36.710> out<00:00:36.920> what

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
sample which we're gonna find out what

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.700 
sample which we're gonna find out what
that<00:00:37.520> organism<00:00:38.060> is<00:00:38.270> doesn't<00:00:38.930> seem<00:00:39.110> typical

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
that organism is doesn't seem typical

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.160 
that organism is doesn't seem typical
for<00:00:40.010> by<00:00:40.220> Polaris<00:00:40.489> leaf<00:00:40.790> spot<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:41.300> we're

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
for by Polaris leaf spot so we're

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.229 
for by Polaris leaf spot so we're
suspecting<00:00:42.590> some<00:00:43.220> other<00:00:43.430> fungus<00:00:43.730> let's<00:00:44.120> see

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
suspecting some other fungus let's see

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.960 
suspecting some other fungus let's see
what<00:00:44.360> we<00:00:44.450> find<00:00:44.570> out<00:00:45.250> well<00:00:46.250> let's<00:00:46.430> get<00:00:46.670> some

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
what we find out well let's get some

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.819 
what we find out well let's get some
mycelium<00:00:47.720> on<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:47.989> microscope<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.500> see<00:00:48.710> what

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
mycelium on the microscope to see what

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.500 
mycelium on the microscope to see what
we<00:00:48.920> can<00:00:49.040> do<00:00:49.220> we<00:00:49.399> like<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.670> scoop<00:00:50.120> up<00:00:50.300> some<00:00:50.329> of

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
we can do we like to scoop up some of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.790 
we can do we like to scoop up some of
the<00:00:50.630> mycelium<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.140> also<00:00:51.410> take<00:00:51.590> a<00:00:51.620> little

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
the mycelium and also take a little

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.190 
the mycelium and also take a little
piece<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.100> leaf<00:00:52.399> tissue<00:00:52.670> with<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.120> lesion<00:00:53.899> on<00:00:54.020> it

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
piece of leaf tissue with a lesion on it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.889 
piece of leaf tissue with a lesion on it
to<00:00:54.559> get<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.010> better<00:00:55.100> idea<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.940> exactly<00:00:56.300> what's

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
to get a better idea of exactly what's

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.750 
to get a better idea of exactly what's
going<00:00:57.110> on<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.680> transfer<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.730> a

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
going on and transfer this to a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.790 
going on and transfer this to a
microscope<00:00:59.570> slide<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.140> then<00:01:00.260> take<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.680> the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
microscope slide and then take it to the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.400 
microscope slide and then take it to the
compound<00:01:01.370> let's<00:01:01.520> go<00:01:01.700> and<00:01:02.660> what<00:01:02.840> we<00:01:02.960> see<00:01:03.140> here

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
compound let's go and what we see here

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.730 
compound let's go and what we see here
is<00:01:04.000> mycelium<00:01:05.000> bending<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:05.810> an<00:01:06.049> angle<00:01:06.500> and

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
is mycelium bending it in an angle and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.800 
is mycelium bending it in an angle and
that<00:01:06.799> is<00:01:07.310> very<00:01:07.610> typical<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.270> Pythium<00:01:08.630> type

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
that is very typical of a Pythium type

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.740 
that is very typical of a Pythium type
species<00:01:09.350> we<00:01:09.920> also<00:01:10.100> look<00:01:10.370> at<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:10.640> -<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.630> we

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
species we also look at that - and we

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.370 
species we also look at that - and we
see<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.080> there<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.530> no<00:01:12.950> septa<00:01:13.790> on<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.870> -<00:01:15.080> at

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
see that there is no septa on the - at

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.950 
see that there is no septa on the - at
all<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.950> there's<00:01:16.220> even<00:01:16.549> some<00:01:16.580> branching<00:01:17.299> that

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
all and there's even some branching that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.950 
all and there's even some branching that
also<00:01:18.580> indicates<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.970> are<00:01:20.330> not<00:01:20.600> seeing

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
also indicates that we are not seeing

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.530 
also indicates that we are not seeing
any<00:01:21.200> septa<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:21.860> we're<00:01:21.979> pretty<00:01:22.159> much<00:01:22.369> into<00:01:23.330> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
any septa so we're pretty much into the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.530 
any septa so we're pretty much into the
general<00:01:24.200> arena<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.400> whole<00:01:26.090> my<00:01:26.240> seats

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
general arena of the whole my seats

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.570 
general arena of the whole my seats
which<00:01:26.930> include<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.530> Pythium<00:01:28.010> species<00:01:28.430> which

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
which include the Pythium species which

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.039 
which include the Pythium species which
is<00:01:28.700> probably<00:01:28.970> what<00:01:29.180> we<00:01:29.360> are<00:01:29.540> looking<00:01:30.020> at

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
is probably what we are looking at

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.620 
is probably what we are looking at
well<00:01:33.049> we<00:01:33.229> frequently<00:01:33.829> like<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.789> retain

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
well we frequently like to retain

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.389 
well we frequently like to retain
samples<00:01:36.170> for<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.409> few<00:01:36.649> extra<00:01:36.920> days<00:01:37.039> in<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.280> case

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
samples for a few extra days in the case

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.459 
samples for a few extra days in the case
of<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.670> Pythium<00:01:38.030> sample<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.600> like<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.960> see<00:01:39.380> if

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
of the Pythium sample we like to see if

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.139 
of the Pythium sample we like to see if
we<00:01:39.590> can<00:01:39.710> wait<00:01:39.920> for<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.219> organism<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:40.850> produce

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
we can wait for the organism to produce

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.639 
we can wait for the organism to produce
some<00:01:41.479> resting<00:01:41.869> structures<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.409> will<00:01:42.500> give

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
some resting structures that will give

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.830 
some resting structures that will give
us<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.920> better<00:01:43.490> idea<00:01:43.579> what<00:01:44.119> species<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.689> might

fungus<00:02:03.530> down<00:02:03.709> here's<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.759> looks<00:02:04.970> like<00:02:05.149> we

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
fungus down here's what it looks like we

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.600 
fungus down here's what it looks like we
let<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.630> incubate<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.990> little<00:02:06.200> bit<00:02:06.289> longer<00:02:06.530> okay

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.530 

difficulty<00:02:10.610> seeing<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.910> mycelium<00:02:11.239> in<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
difficulty seeing the mycelium in the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.460 
difficulty seeing the mycelium in the
previous<00:02:12.610> segment<00:02:13.610> no<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:14.660> don't<00:02:15.290> think<00:02:15.319> you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
previous segment no I don't think you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.800 
previous segment no I don't think you
have<00:02:15.590> any<00:02:15.739> trouble<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.510> looks<00:02:17.750> pretty

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
have any trouble so it looks pretty

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.000 
have any trouble so it looks pretty
solid<00:02:19.780> coverage<00:02:20.780> with<00:02:20.900> mycelium<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:24.010> we'll

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
solid coverage with mycelium and we'll

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.589 
solid coverage with mycelium and we'll
take<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> look<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.459> see<00:02:25.549> if<00:02:25.640> we<00:02:25.760> can<00:02:25.910> pick

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
take a look and see if we can pick

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.080 
take a look and see if we can pick
around<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:27.019> here<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.349> find<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:28.430> Otto<00:02:28.640> spores

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
around in here and find some Otto spores

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.110 
around in here and find some Otto spores
chlamydia<00:02:29.660> spores<00:02:30.760> something<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:31.910> that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
chlamydia spores something like that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.250 
chlamydia spores something like that
that<00:02:32.239> would<00:02:32.360> give<00:02:32.510> us<00:02:32.599> an<00:02:32.690> idea<00:02:32.930> what<00:02:33.140> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
that would give us an idea what the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.819 
that would give us an idea what the
species<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.799> let's<00:02:34.160> take<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> look<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:36.410> sample

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
species is let's take a look this sample

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.250 
species is let's take a look this sample
of<00:02:36.920> -<00:02:37.519> was<00:02:37.639> stained<00:02:37.970> with<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.239> red<00:02:38.720> dye<00:02:38.959> called

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
of - was stained with a red dye called

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.460 
of - was stained with a red dye called
safranin<00:02:40.069> oh<00:02:40.579> this<00:02:41.389> allows<00:02:41.690> us<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.079> see<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
safranin oh this allows us to see the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.110 
safranin oh this allows us to see the
fungus<00:02:42.950> structures<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.459> little<00:02:43.549> bit<00:02:43.880> better

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
fungus structures a little bit better

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.490 
fungus structures a little bit better
and<00:02:44.420> what<00:02:44.569> we're<00:02:44.720> seeing<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.079> center<00:02:45.350> of

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
and what we're seeing in the center of

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.150 
and what we're seeing in the center of
the<00:02:45.769> monitor<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.609> in<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.380> terminal<00:02:48.440> le'me<00:02:48.980> dos

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the monitor is in the terminal le'me dos

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.610 
the monitor is in the terminal le'me dos
4<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.790> that's<00:02:50.540> typical<00:02:51.109> for<00:02:51.139> some<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.560> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
4 and that's typical for some of the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.440 
4 and that's typical for some of the
Pythian<00:02:51.829> species<00:02:52.519> but<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.880> doesn't<00:02:53.180> provide

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
Pythian species but it doesn't provide

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.449 
Pythian species but it doesn't provide
us<00:02:53.630> enough<00:02:53.930> information<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.250> able<00:02:55.280> to

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
us enough information to be able to

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.479 
us enough information to be able to
identify<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.060> Pythian<00:02:56.690> 2<00:02:57.109> species<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.400> are

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
identify this Pythian 2 species so are

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.740 
identify this Pythian 2 species so are
pretty<00:02:58.639> much<00:02:58.819> stuck<00:02:59.030> at<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.269> level<00:02:59.480> right

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
pretty much stuck at that level right

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.890 
pretty much stuck at that level right
now<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.319> if<00:03:00.769> we<00:03:00.950> find<00:03:01.549> any<00:03:01.760> additional<00:03:02.299> spores

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
now and if we find any additional spores

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.580 
now and if we find any additional spores
we'll<00:03:03.170> let<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.440> know

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
we'll let you know

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.650 
we'll let you know
take<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.370> look<00:03:04.549> at<00:03:04.639> the<00:03:04.730> update<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.299> some

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
take a look at the update for some

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.340 
take a look at the update for some
additional<00:03:05.870> information<00:03:06.109> on<00:03:06.829> Pythium
