00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
can probably already tell that they're

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
can probably already tell that they're
broken<00:00:24.170> they<00:00:25.170> split<00:00:25.680> apart<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.369> few<00:00:26.730> weeks<00:00:26.880> ago

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
broken they split apart a few weeks ago

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.950 
broken they split apart a few weeks ago
and<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:29.250> literally<00:00:29.580> didn't<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.119> anything<00:00:30.390> for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and I literally didn't do anything for

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.280 
and I literally didn't do anything for
them<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> split<00:00:31.500> apart<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.239> did<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.450> drop<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
them to split apart I did not drop it I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.790 
them to split apart I did not drop it I
did<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.340> crack<00:00:35.760> anything<00:00:36.800> but

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
did not you know crack anything but

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.150 
did not you know crack anything but
literally<00:00:39.530> they<00:00:40.530> come<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
literally they come out just like that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.260 
literally they come out just like that
so<00:00:45.440> that<00:00:46.440> kind<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.010> leads<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.239> believe

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
so that kind of leads me to believe

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.479 
so that kind of leads me to believe
maybe<00:00:48.840> they're<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.350> made<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.039> best<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
maybe they're not made the best that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.139 
maybe they're not made the best that
they<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:52.550> anyway<00:00:53.550> I'm<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> tell

white and the black um it's not really a
black<00:01:55.200> black<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> grayish

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
black black it's kind of a grayish

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.480 
black black it's kind of a grayish
silvery<00:01:56.820> black<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.770> tell<00:01:59.070> they're

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
silvery black if you can tell they're

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.289 
silvery black if you can tell they're
very<00:01:59.759> shiny<00:02:00.649> they<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.979> create<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> nice<00:02:02.670> look<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
very shiny they can create a nice look I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.819 
very shiny they can create a nice look I
just<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:03.810> could<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.020> more<00:02:04.290> pigmented

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
just think they could be more pigmented

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.889 
just think they could be more pigmented
and<00:02:05.130> again<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> packaging<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and again the packaging is like the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.839 
and again the packaging is like the
blush<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.890> lipstick<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.399> kind<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.670> just

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
blush and the lipstick it's kind of just

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.839 
blush and the lipstick it's kind of just
flimsy<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.869> me<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.289> doesn't<00:02:10.500> feel<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.129> it's

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
flimsy to me it doesn't feel like it's

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.170 
flimsy to me it doesn't feel like it's
the<00:02:12.209> best<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.629> could<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> doesn't<00:02:13.230> feel
