00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.740
 it's oxygen how are you 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 would put well today we end up 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.840
 no new south 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.869
 so I said that on my videos and 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.140
 a lot of people who ask me 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.940
 how to open its ports so everything 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.940
 simply I want to show you how 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.359
 we make to go through oman traffic 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.100
 then you go in so start menu 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.329
 windows 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.160
 put them in no configuration 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.329
 then you go into system of 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 security you put in category 1 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.410
 after firewall windows 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 then you go to settings 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.680
 advances 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.700
 so you have to nail yourself either 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:14.560
 yannick on the other hand after you go in 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.130
 incoming traffic settings so I'm going 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.880
 show for example here there are 2 I 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.079
 created from rules so for very tight of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.369
 it's simple you make news 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:31.450
 rules then you fold you take port 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.750
 click surpour I wear 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.350
 then you do next you tick 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.930
 so let you tcp always ports 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.780
 specific local and there you mark from 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.960
 5.5 6 5 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.740
 we all made following authors and the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.130
 next connection let you all 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.580
 checked 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.530
 according to following and there you put the name 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.450
 that you like it advises you to 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.360
 to put certainly will be here and after we 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.570
 done done so I'm doing it because 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.750
 that I already did then you redo 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.510
 another wave 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.530
 always tick next port this time 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.440
 we took a dp always for local 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.690
 specific that marks you is always 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.390
 5-5 6 5 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.050
 then always following the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.250
 connection always like this and after 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.030
 you mark minecraft servers 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 now I advise you to put 2 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.270
 so afro is done enormously 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.310
 you can go to your server 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.760
 Minecraft 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.890
 here it is simple so like that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.180
 all those who will ask me for my 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.150
 notice of increases how to create a 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.470
 not serving 6.7 employs 7 points 2 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.000
 passes and bastos 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.650
 thank you very much for keeping 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.300
 civil and the next and remember 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.300
