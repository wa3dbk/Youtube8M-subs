00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:07.240
 deciphering a package insert is not a simple task to begin with. 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.949
 font size 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.399
 the lyrics for example of this night being in mine in my hand 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.439
 much less clear 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.320
 a person even with others 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 If it is not very clear, I will not be able to 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.240
 So 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.150
 the advisable thing is that if the size of the letters actually put them I get 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.009
 to see 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.550
 more without pressure 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.010
 nor I understand practically nothing of what is spoken here within the products 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.980
 these diseases are practically impossible I put another is that 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 I can not understand even the time it's written by bbc 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.610
 today there is no standard for the package inserts the labs will use crutches and 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.050
 different sizes and formats 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.450
 many information is difficult to understand is actually very small that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.330
 Today's homicide nomenclatures 1 I find it very difficult for people who are 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.050
 speech 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.749
 we practically settle dictionary 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.720
 to seek to understand the words 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.550
 I understand so I think they should improve it and put their words 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.330
 easier understanding of people examples of difficult words and not 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.210
 missing 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.360
 This pharmacist said that the information contained in the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.500
 very difficult and very difficult to understand. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.360
 patient do not even understand 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.190
 without victory in the role of information 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.820
 and we are the city because they are more than often take into account the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.170
 qualified professional 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.460
 it is a time that the person not inside the interior does not have a telephone 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.480
 that I get really hard 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.500
 if the patient has an information 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
 more detailed thousand and more 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.180
 aerial 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.110
 technical 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.270
 the anvisa established a standard that put the matter in public consultation 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.729
 proposed by the national health surveillance agency, the targets have a 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.070
 space between them would be larger and more readable this all to facilitate 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.590
 consumer reading 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.400
 improving it and if it will make it much easier people have the people will make me 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.879
 I could see 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.399
 r of similar understanding 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.380
 yes a novelty should still take a while 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.590
 the public consultation goes until the end of the month and after the visa he 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.720
 resolution thereafter, the laboratories will have six months to 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.629
 adapt 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.120
 The changes also include different balls a technique for the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.180
 health professionals and another to patients in the form of questions 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.389
 to have exposed in plain language 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.999
 the consumer information has to be different from the lot of training people 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.569
 that I'm going to start from a drawing knowing that it's one more a professional to 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.109
 question and answer 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.239
 it's easier to interpret 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.230
 there are also alert too size will make it much easier I think it will be 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.099
 great 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.630
 but while change does not come 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.960
 the showcase changes will still continue to challenge those who need to sell a ball 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.279
 So the way, now, wait for the 13 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.119
 jackie 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.959
 two more days
