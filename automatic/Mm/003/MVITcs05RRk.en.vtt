complete clap the guy this is a
scientist<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.520> we<00:00:05.609> starting<00:00:05.879> off<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
scientist and we starting off with the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.360 
scientist and we starting off with the
original<00:00:06.569> starting<00:00:07.020> scientist<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.649> I

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
original starting scientist and I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.830 
original starting scientist and I
actually<00:00:08.519> for<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.849> most<00:00:09.030> part<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
actually for the most part on the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.480 
actually for the most part on the
zombies<00:00:10.110> team<00:00:10.320> when<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.590> first<00:00:10.769> got<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.040> game<00:00:11.250> I

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
zombies team when I first got the game I

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.310 
zombies team when I first got the game I
actually<00:00:12.030> used<00:00:12.300> his<00:00:12.420> character<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> most<00:00:13.080> I

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
actually used his character the most I

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.350 
actually used his character the most I
enjoy<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.740> most<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.670> felt<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.179> was<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
enjoy the most and it I felt it was the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.140 
enjoy the most and it I felt it was the
most<00:00:15.680> strongest<00:00:16.680> character<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.550> begin<00:00:18.000> with

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
most strongest character to begin with

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.970 
most strongest character to begin with
with<00:00:18.330> starting<00:00:18.660> characters<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.590> definitely

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
with starting characters so I definitely

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.429 
with starting characters so I definitely
recommend<00:00:20.670> using<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.270> character<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.289> has

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
recommend using this character as it has

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.259 
recommend using this character as it has
high<00:00:22.590> damage<00:00:22.890> I'll<00:00:23.189> close<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> medium

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
high damage I'll close to the medium

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060 
high damage I'll close to the medium
range<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.350> gets<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> quite<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
range and it really gets you a quite a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
range and it really gets you a quite a
few<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.490> shots<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.420> those<00:00:27.570> clutch

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
few one shots in there in those clutch

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:46.829 
few one shots in there in those clutch
moment

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.090 

next<00:00:47.839> we<00:00:47.929> the<00:00:48.079> marine<00:00:48.320> biologist<00:00:48.769> is<00:00:48.920> through

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
next we the marine biologist is through

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.099 
next we the marine biologist is through
spray<00:00:49.399> impact<00:00:49.760> damage<00:00:49.940> at<00:00:50.269> close<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.659> medium

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
spray impact damage at close to medium

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.500 
spray impact damage at close to medium
range<00:00:51.350> as<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:52.219> says<00:00:52.399> it's<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.820> spraying<00:00:53.149> type<00:00:53.359> of

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
range as it says it's a spraying type of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.969 
range as it says it's a spraying type of
gun<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:53.839> doesn't<00:00:54.079> do<00:00:54.140> much<00:00:54.289> damage<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:54.890> if

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
gun so it doesn't do much damage but if

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.319 
gun so it doesn't do much damage but if
you<00:00:55.070> get<00:00:55.190> all<00:00:55.280> your<00:00:55.309> shots<00:00:55.609> you<00:00:55.879> might<00:00:56.149> you

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
you get all your shots you might you

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:16.590 
you get all your shots you might you
will<00:00:56.510> most<00:00:56.929> likely<00:00:57.109> to<00:00:57.350> go

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.240 

next<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:17.689> have<00:01:17.780> dr.<00:01:18.170> toxic<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.009> spray

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
next we have dr. toxic this to the spray

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.130 
next we have dr. toxic this to the spray
toxic<00:01:19.700> damage<00:01:19.969> at<00:01:20.180> Short<00:01:20.539> can<00:01:20.719> be<00:01:20.810> arranged

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
toxic damage at Short can be arranged

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.560 
toxic damage at Short can be arranged
I've<00:01:22.039> only<00:01:22.220> uses<00:01:22.490> capital<00:01:22.789> twice<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.329> from

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
I've only uses capital twice and from

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.179 
I've only uses capital twice and from
what<00:01:23.720> I've<00:01:23.869> seen<00:01:23.899> is<00:01:24.380> complete<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.070> our

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
what I've seen is complete and our

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.249 
what I've seen is complete and our
garbage<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.909> they've<00:01:26.479> damaged<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.020> spray

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
garbage it they've damaged the spray

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.810 
garbage it they've damaged the spray
doesn't<00:01:27.380> seem<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.039> do<00:01:28.159> any<00:01:28.310> sort<00:01:28.429> of<00:01:28.520> damage

doesn't seem to do any sort of damage

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.090 
doesn't seem to do any sort of damage
and<00:01:28.969> it's<00:01:29.810> very<00:01:30.229> difficult<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.560> get<00:01:30.679> kills<00:01:30.860> on

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
and it's very difficult to get kills on

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.889 
and it's very difficult to get kills on
the<00:01:31.189> show<00:01:31.369> when<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.060> gun<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.329> their<00:01:32.450> face<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:32.869> i

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
the show when the gun in their face so i

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.639 
the show when the gun in their face so i
will<00:01:33.140> recommend<00:01:33.289> using<00:01:33.619> this<00:01:33.740> character<00:01:35.649> next

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
will recommend using this character next

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.590 
will recommend using this character next
we<00:01:36.740> had<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.950> physicist<00:01:37.399> who<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.090> electric

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
we had the physicist who do electric

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.109 
we had the physicist who do electric
shock<00:01:38.810> damage<00:01:39.140> at<00:01:39.409> short<00:01:39.710> range<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.789> music

shock damage at short range and music

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.999 
shock damage at short range and music
have<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> much<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:41.990> from<00:01:42.170> when<00:01:42.319> i<00:01:42.350> did<00:01:42.619> use<00:01:42.829> him

have a much but from when i did use him

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.039 
have a much but from when i did use him
i<00:01:43.159> did<00:01:43.310> enjoy<00:01:43.460> him<00:01:43.759> as<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:44.210> spray<00:01:44.569> damage<00:01:44.899> i

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
i did enjoy him as the spray damage i

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.380 
i did enjoy him as the spray damage i
don't<00:01:45.259> really<00:01:45.470> enjoy<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.830> much<00:01:46.220> as<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.209> it's

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
don't really enjoy that much as it it's

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.399 
don't really enjoy that much as it it's
not<00:01:47.569> that<00:01:47.720> very<00:01:47.840> effective<00:01:50.080> next<00:01:51.080> we<00:01:51.259> have<00:01:51.349> the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
not that very effective next we have the

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.199 
not that very effective next we have the
astronaut<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.159> does<00:01:52.369> impact<00:01:52.580> damage<00:01:52.939> at

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
astronaut that does impact damage at

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.669 
astronaut that does impact damage at
being<00:01:53.539> for<00:01:53.750> long<00:01:53.869> range<00:01:54.049> this<00:01:54.319> is<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.590> only

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
being for long range this is the only

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.919 
being for long range this is the only
scientist<00:01:55.189> that<00:01:55.369> has<00:01:55.549> a<00:01:55.880> long-range<00:01:56.539> shot

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
scientist that has a long-range shot

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.770 
scientist that has a long-range shot
which<00:01:57.140> has<00:01:57.349> 18<00:01:57.979> shots<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.789> it's<00:01:59.630> quite

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
which has 18 shots in it and it's quite

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.839 
which has 18 shots in it and it's quite
good<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.409> if<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.189> want<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.459> long-range

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
good but if you want a long-range

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.309 
good but if you want a long-range
scientist<00:02:02.479> i'm<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.780> letting<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.229> way

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
scientist i'm just letting the way

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:12.339 
scientist i'm just letting the way
forward<00:02:10.390> lastly<00:02:11.390> we<00:02:11.510> have<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.660> chemist<00:02:12.110> and

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
forward lastly we have a chemist and

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.350 
forward lastly we have a chemist and
i've<00:02:12.709> only<00:02:12.799> uses<00:02:13.130> character<00:02:13.519> at<00:02:13.640> once<00:02:13.880> but

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
i've only uses character at once but

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.839 
i've only uses character at once but
when<00:02:14.480> i<00:02:14.510> used<00:02:14.810> him<00:02:15.079> i<00:02:15.319> absolutely<00:02:15.980> dominated

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849
