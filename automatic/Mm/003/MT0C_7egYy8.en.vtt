sometimes well half the time I don't
even<00:00:56.460> wrap<00:00:56.699> my<00:00:56.730> hair<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.180> good<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.510> um<00:00:57.840> but

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
even wrap my hair to be good way um but

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.470 
even wrap my hair to be good way um but
what<00:00:59.129> I've<00:00:59.250> been<00:00:59.340> doing<00:00:59.640> lately<00:00:59.670> if<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.329> was

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
what I've been doing lately if I was

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.029 
what I've been doing lately if I was
just<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:00.989> big<00:01:01.170> braid<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.530> McKoy<00:01:01.770> City

so<00:01:02.579> yeah<00:01:02.670> that's<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> did<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.570> hair

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

so yeah that's what I did with this hair
and<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:03.989> why<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.530> loose<00:01:04.769> wave

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and that's why I have this loose wave

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
and that's why I have this loose wave
right<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.610> yeah<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> curl

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
right here yeah this is not the curl

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
right here yeah this is not the curl
pattern<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> hair<00:01:08.520> by<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> way<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
pattern of the hair by the way this is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.750 
pattern of the hair by the way this is
just<00:01:11.900> it's<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.250> something<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.310> create<00:01:14.580> yeah

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
just it's just something I create yeah

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.820 
just it's just something I create yeah
so<00:01:14.970> tangling<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.689> minimal<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> does

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
so tangling it's minimal but it does

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130 
so tangling it's minimal but it does
happen<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> happen

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
happen I do see it happen

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.070 
happen I do see it happen
shedding<00:01:19.619> um<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:21.650> say<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> lot<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.430> sorry

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
shedding um I say I'm a lot I'm sorry
so<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> shedding<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.610> some

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
so what for is shedding I do get some

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
so what for is shedding I do get some
strands<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.110> wake<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> morning

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
strands when I wake up in the morning

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
strands when I wake up in the morning
for<00:01:29.220> example<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.150> expect<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.720> five<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
for example I can expect to get five to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
for example I can expect to get five to
ten<00:01:31.290> instruments<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.890> coming<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.250> my<00:01:32.430> hair

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610

ten instruments from coming out my hair
throughout<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> day<00:01:34.020> I'll<00:01:34.380> probably<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.979> two

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
throughout the day I'll probably get two

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
throughout the day I'll probably get two
to<00:01:35.460> three<00:01:35.700> strands<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.390> okay<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> would

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
to three strands which is okay I would

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.120 
to three strands which is okay I would
prefer<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.710> way

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
prefer it that way

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.050 
prefer it that way
I<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:39.090> mind<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.049> much<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.670> got<00:01:42.030> a

see<00:06:10.230> I<00:06:10.470> don't<00:06:10.830> mind<00:06:11.010> seed<00:06:11.280> processing<00:06:11.490> it

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
see I don't mind seed processing it

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.940 
see I don't mind seed processing it
because<00:06:12.240> I<00:06:12.330> find<00:06:12.510> curly<00:06:13.020> hair<00:06:13.170> is<00:06:13.380> harder<00:06:13.800> to

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
because I find curly hair is harder to

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.650 
because I find curly hair is harder to
find<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:14.370> it's<00:06:14.550> harder<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:15.000> find<00:06:15.030> curly<00:06:15.480> hair

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
find and it's harder to find curly hair

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.450 
find and it's harder to find curly hair
that<00:06:15.780> doesn't<00:06:16.080> tangle<00:06:16.350> like<00:06:16.710> crazy<00:06:16.980> and<00:06:17.190> shed

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
that doesn't tangle like crazy and shed

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.950 
that doesn't tangle like crazy and shed
like<00:06:17.640> crazy<00:06:17.910> but<00:06:18.480> it's<00:06:18.600> also<00:06:18.750> really

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
like crazy but it's also really

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.840 
like crazy but it's also really
time-consuming<00:06:19.320> so<00:06:19.830> I<00:06:19.860> don't<00:06:20.160> mind<00:06:20.310> my<00:06:20.460> curly

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850
