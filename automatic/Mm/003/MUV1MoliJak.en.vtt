 HP System Recovery is a software tool for restoring software and drives to the computer's initial state. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.356
 If your computer is infected with a virus, system files are crashed or deleted, 

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:21.708
 Delete all software applications 

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:27.000
 Hard drive recovery is useful when you want to restart. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 This video explains how to recover your computer software to its original state when you first purchased it with HP System Recovery. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.790
 Before you begin, remove any disks or other devices that are inserted or associated with your computer. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.455
 If your computer has an external disk drive, leave it connected. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.911
 Once Windows is running, you can start recovery from the Windows 8 start screen. 

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:08.689
 Enter "Repair" on the welcome screen. 

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.900
 Then select HP Recovery Manager. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 When the User Accounts window opens, click Yes. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.678
 Recovery Manager opens. 

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:24.541
 Click Windows Recovery Environment. 

00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:30.000
 Check the computer reboot and continue the recovery process. 

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:37.780

00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:47.672
 Recovery Manager opens. 

00:01:50.904 --> 00:02:00.904
 If Windows is not running, turn on your computer and press the F11 key repeatedly once per second until the first screen appears. 

00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:05.152
 When your computer restarts, click to select the keyboard layout. 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:07.928

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:19.867
 Recovery Manager opens. 

00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:31.187
 In some cases, the recovery information stored on the hard drive may be corrupted by a missing or hard drive replacement. 

00:02:31.187 --> 00:02:38.830
 In this case, you will need to restore your computer to a recovery disc or a recovery USB drive. 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:48.000
 NOTE: If you use the USB recovery driver, the following steps may be similar, but this example uses recovery discs. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.479
 Insert the first recovery disc into the CD / DVD drive. 

00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:59.875
 After the disc is fully inserted, press and hold the power button until the computer turns off. 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.286
 Wait a few seconds. 

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:11.811
 After turning on the computer, press the Esc key repeatedly at approximately one second intervals until the Start menu opens. 

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.742

 Recovery Manager opens. 

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:39.812
 Perform System Recovery in Windows, or select Restore Minimized Image if Windows does not start. 

00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:46.431
 If you are performing a recovery to disk as shown here, select Factory Reset. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.861
 If you have important files on your hard drive, they will be permanently deleted from the recovery process if you do not back them up at this point. 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.000
 If you have not already saved the file, first select Back up file. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Decide whether you want Recovery Manager to choose 10 billion files, or choose your own files. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Select the type of file you want to back up. 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.660
 This example selects all file types. 

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:21.893
 A progress bar appears on the system during computer file scanning. 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.000
 Insert the media to restore the backup file. CD / DVD or USB drive. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.814
 In this example, I choose a removable drive. 

00:04:50.743 --> 00:04:54.686
 Follow the instructions on the screen to finish backing up your data. 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.878
 If you can not back up your files or you do not want to back them up, choose to recover without backing up your files. 

00:05:04.142 --> 00:05:08.000
 On the HP Recovery Manager Welcome screen, click Next. 

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:12.000
 Click OK in the warning message to continue. 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.626
 The recovery process begins. This will take some time to complete. 

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:20.910
 If you are using recovery discs, the process can take an hour or more 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.347
 If you have more than one disc, you will be prompted to insert additional discs. 

00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:46.000
 When the recovery process is complete, the Restore Complete screen is displayed. 

00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:53.438
 Note: If you use recovery discs shipped from HP, the final screen may look different. 

00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:57.790
 Click Finish. The recovery process is complete. 

00:05:58.335 --> 00:06:03.000
 Now restart your computer and the Windows installation process will begin. 

00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:08.238
 At the end of recovery, your computer becomes very vulnerable to security threats. 

00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:12.777
 Security software must be installed before connecting to the Internet. 

00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:16.333
 When you have finished installing the security software on your computer, connect to the Internet. 

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:21.214
 To update your system to the latest version, you must do this before installing any other software. 

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:27.085
 When you are connected, run your security software and get the latest updates to your security software. 

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:30.000
 In particular, you need to update the virus definitions. 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.408
 Open the Windows Update tool in PC Settings to download the latest Windows updates. 

00:06:35.408 --> 00:06:41.797
 Open the HP Support Assistance from the start screen to install the latest critical updates from HP. 

00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:49.000
 Now that the system has been repaired and updated, you can reconnect and install previously disconnected devices. 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.500
