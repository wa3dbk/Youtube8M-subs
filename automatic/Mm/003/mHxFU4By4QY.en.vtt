pieces and we use a cork table with
glass<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.210> keep<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> light<00:01:40.350> air<00:01:40.680> going

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
glass to keep the light air going

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670 
glass to keep the light air going
through<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.180> pick<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> oak<00:01:43.290> tones

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
