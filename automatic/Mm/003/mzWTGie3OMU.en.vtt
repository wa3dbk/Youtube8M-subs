00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.150 

I<00:05:09.700> was<00:05:10.700> expecting<00:05:11.000> more<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.450> chocolatey

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
I was expecting more of a chocolatey

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.650 
I was expecting more of a chocolatey
taste<00:05:13.160> for<00:05:13.400> some<00:05:13.550> reason<00:05:13.970> it's<00:05:14.240> not<00:05:14.419> there

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
taste for some reason it's not there

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.370 
taste for some reason it's not there
it's<00:05:14.900> uh<00:05:18.370> well<00:05:19.930> there's<00:05:20.930> more<00:05:21.110> alcohol<00:05:21.350> smell

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
it's uh well there's more alcohol smell

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:33.490 
it's uh well there's more alcohol smell
but<00:05:24.380> it<00:05:24.530> isn't<00:05:24.860> a<00:05:24.919> taste<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.400> me<00:05:32.200> it's<00:05:33.200> there

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
but it isn't a taste to me it's there

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.260 
but it isn't a taste to me it's there
but<00:05:33.710> it's<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:33.950> no<00:05:34.160> that's<00:05:34.400> not<00:05:34.520> overpowering

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
but it's just no that's not overpowering

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.820 
but it's just no that's not overpowering
like<00:05:35.419> I<00:05:35.570> was<00:05:35.690> expecting<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.320> be<00:05:36.790> at<00:05:37.790> 10.5%

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
like I was expecting it to be at 10.5%

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.460 
like I was expecting it to be at 10.5%
very<00:05:39.830> nice<00:05:40.010> lacing<00:05:40.430> in<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.580> glass<00:05:40.760> already

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
very nice lacing in the glass already

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.290 
very nice lacing in the glass already
and<00:05:42.470> this<00:05:42.710> probably<00:05:43.040> needs<00:05:43.190> to<00:05:43.310> warm<00:05:43.580> up<00:05:43.760> just

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
and this probably needs to warm up just

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.060 
and this probably needs to warm up just
come<00:05:44.450> out<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:44.720> frigerator<00:05:45.110> so<00:05:45.350> it's<00:05:45.500> about<00:05:45.680> 40

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
come out the frigerator so it's about 40

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.050 
come out the frigerator so it's about 40
to<00:05:46.280> 45<00:05:46.700> degrees<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:49.190> it<00:05:49.400> says<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:49.790> should<00:05:49.940> be

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
to 45 degrees so it says it should be

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.940 
to 45 degrees so it says it should be
served<00:05:50.810> in<00:05:50.990> a<00:05:51.020> little<00:05:51.050> warmer<00:05:51.590> than<00:05:51.710> that<00:05:51.919> so

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
served in a little warmer than that so

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.320 
served in a little warmer than that so
I'm<00:05:54.950> gonna<00:05:55.100> just<00:05:55.370> warm<00:05:55.639> up<00:05:55.760> just<00:05:56.000> a<00:05:56.090> little<00:05:56.120> bit
