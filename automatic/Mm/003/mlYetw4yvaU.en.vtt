00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.389
 hi dear friends glad to see you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.350
 here on my channel which is dedicated 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.029
 more appetizing things than sport &amp; 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.369
 beauty stories so let's today 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 we will start learning to cook 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.900
 maybe someone doesn't want to start 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 learn to cook can just let go 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.730
 drooling and looking at how we will 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.260
 cook and so i decided to start myself what 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 neither is the Italian theme 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 I want to say that in every home not even 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.800
 house in every refrigerator must be 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 pesto sauce is salvation for the hungry 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.739
 let's say so if there's nothing in the house always 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.649
 maybe there will be spaghetti any post 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.989
 before there are any pasta abandoned there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
 in the closet which is just not on their own 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.260
 delicious but if you add sauce to pasta 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.460
 pesto that dish is transformed into the present 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.460
 Italian 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.320
 culinary art gains 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
 unusual taste here than you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.130
 find a way out and cook 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.970
 the porridge from the ax roughly speaking 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.520
 then I give you a recipe for a really 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 from italian hands because real 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.689
 Italians taught me to cook 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
 present place now let's start with 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.540
 products that we need of course 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.150
 same main product basil in fresh it 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.930
 form an essential attribute of this sauce 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.799
 it is olive oil in the form of cheese 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.900
 parmigiano and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.310
 picara cheese and parmesan stuff 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.500
 if there is no sheep cheese then 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.460
 do principle and goat cedar cheese 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.439
 nuts in mean and a further because 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.579
 tools we need a blender us 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.659
 need a grater empty plate and 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.970
 need an empty jar in which 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.710
 will be stored pesto you can choose 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.399
 I love some beautiful bottle 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.229
 here are such different bottles for sauces but 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.350
 here I was cooking just olive oil 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.570
 eg 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.750
 rosemary and with pepper and let's 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.119
 let's start everything is done quite simply 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.850
 the whole thing 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:22.840
 laying the blender so first thing in 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:24.850
 blender goes basil don't cut anything 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 it is possible even straightly probably entirely in bunches 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.380
 put in a blender and basically i 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 I think this is enough to get somewhere 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.000
 gram twenty basil for all 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.450
 add about 80 100 grams of oil 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.180
 olive do not do a lot of sauce because 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.530
 what does he quickly spoil his need to do 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.310
 literally on day 2 now go in 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.110
 parmigiano and and karoch from both cheese and 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.110
 grate pre 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.540
 pour cheese in a blender 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.610
 and pine nuts fall asleep last 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.400
 turn 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.420
 close the lid push the button and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.420
 I'm good at everything 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:45.709
 will aroma well and last remaining 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:49.250
 twig all the same, too, will finalize all of our 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.709
 the sauce is ready what kind of vapor we have 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.270
 basilica 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.670
 note that the judge did not add 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.890
 because instead of salt we have added 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:04.370
 parmigiano and goat cheese so he 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.220
 will give a specific solenaty such 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:13.660
 taste yes and here the goal of course we do not 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.660
 I needed appetite immediately woke up 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.590
 great great taste great 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.609
 the quality of the whole thing remains for small 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.609
 cooking spaghetti 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:42.180
 so 10 12 minutes and glass and spaghetti 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.360
 albenza we are ready 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.360
 what are they 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.300
 add quest 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.640
 Well, here is the floor of the jar almost at me 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.500
 I love him by the way pesto 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.280
 excellent not only for spaghetti dough 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.100
 well also suitable for meat for 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.930
 beef for chicken and in general the 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.610
 principle even on bread for sandwiches 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.610
 all bon appetite
