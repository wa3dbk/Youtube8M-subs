00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
but towards the end it really starts to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.540 
but towards the end it really starts to
pick<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.740> start<00:00:25.980> picking<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.400> a
