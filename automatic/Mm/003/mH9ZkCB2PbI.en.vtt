know just did Batman Arkham Knight and
that<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.480> how<00:00:57.629> well<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.930> went<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
that we all know how well that went so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
that we all know how well that went so
I'm<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> little<00:00:59.370> hesitant<00:00:59.550> about<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.510> game

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

coming<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.530> I'm<00:01:01.649> also<00:01:01.910> kind<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.000> afraid

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
coming out and I'm also kind of afraid

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
coming out and I'm also kind of afraid
that<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.320> same<00:01:04.530> exact

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that it's going to use the same exact

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.250 
that it's going to use the same exact
formula<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.580> Batman<00:01:06.119> games<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.780> shadow

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
formula as the Batman games and shadow

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
formula as the Batman games and shadow
of<00:01:07.439> Mordor<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.010> used<00:01:08.220> its<00:01:08.340> combat<00:01:08.850> system

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
of Mordor which used its combat system

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
of Mordor which used its combat system
I'm<00:01:09.570> afraid<00:01:10.020> they're<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.530> use

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
I'm afraid they're going to just use

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
I'm afraid they're going to just use
that<00:01:10.860> combat<00:01:11.280> system<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.820> sort<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that combat system and just sort of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.490 
that combat system and just sort of
abuse<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> death<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
abuse it to death and it's just going to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.950 
abuse it to death and it's just going to
be<00:01:13.590> another<00:01:13.830> sort<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> reskin<00:01:15.119> Batman<00:01:15.630> game<00:01:15.840> in

things with the Nemesis system and the
combat<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.610> good<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.240> really

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
combat you know was good but they really

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210

which<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.380> Unreal<00:01:34.799> Engine<00:01:34.890> 3<00:01:35.159> which

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
which was on Unreal Engine 3 which

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460 
which was on Unreal Engine 3 which
normally<00:01:36.119> would<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.360> been<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> great<00:01:37.200> engine

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
normally would have been a great engine

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
normally would have been a great engine
and<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.740> kind<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.979> hard<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> believe<00:01:38.369> they

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and it's kind of hard to believe they

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
and it's kind of hard to believe they
even<00:01:38.700> mess<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> on

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
even mess that up but this is on

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.219 
even mess that up but this is on
avalanches<00:01:41.400> own<00:01:41.610> in-house<00:01:42.420> engine<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
avalanches own in-house engine it's the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.410 
avalanches own in-house engine it's the
same<00:01:43.409> engine<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:43.829> used<00:01:44.040> back<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.549> Just<00:01:45.240> Cause

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
same engine they used back on Just Cause

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.450 
same engine they used back on Just Cause
2<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.320> modified<00:01:46.860> version<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
2 it's just a modified version of that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.520 
2 it's just a modified version of that
they've<00:01:47.700> introduced<00:01:48.210> some<00:01:48.360> new<00:01:48.530> graphical

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
they've introduced some new graphical

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
they've introduced some new graphical
effects<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> help<00:01:50.189> improve<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> look<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
effects to help improve the look of the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.359 
effects to help improve the look of the
game<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.259> looking<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> pretty

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
game so it is looking to be a pretty

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.920 
game so it is looking to be a pretty
decent<00:01:53.430> title<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.030> far<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.299> graphics<00:01:54.810> or

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
decent title as far as graphics or

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870 
decent title as far as graphics or
speaking<00:01:55.320> anyway<00:01:55.619> from<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> gameplay

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
speaking anyway from what the gameplay

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.300 
speaking anyway from what the gameplay
that<00:01:56.909> I've<00:01:57.149> seen<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.719> far<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.740> jumping<00:01:59.130> over

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that I've seen so far but jumping over

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.530 
that I've seen so far but jumping over
to<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> system<00:01:59.729> requirements<00:02:00.240> now<00:02:00.360> we'll

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
to the system requirements now we'll

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.840 
to the system requirements now we'll
take<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> look<00:02:00.810> first<00:02:01.170> at<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.649> minimum<00:02:02.130> system

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
take a look first at the minimum system

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
really too crazy there with those system

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.160 
really too crazy there with those system
requirements<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:48.890> know<00:02:48.980> 660ti<00:02:49.819> or<00:02:50.150> 7870<00:02:51.049> is

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
requirements you know 660ti or 7870 is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.199 
requirements you know 660ti or 7870 is
really<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.920> know<00:02:52.010> nothing<00:02:52.370> too<00:02:52.580> major<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.090> it

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
really you know nothing too major so it

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.210 
really you know nothing too major so it
seems<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:53.930> game<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.350> possibly<00:02:55.100> going

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
seems like this game is possibly going

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.830 
seems like this game is possibly going
to<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.430> fairly<00:02:55.760> well<00:02:55.880> optimized<00:02:56.360> at<00:02:56.510> least<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
to be fairly well optimized at least the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.900 
to be fairly well optimized at least the
the<00:02:57.620> system<00:02:57.980> requirements<00:02:58.580> would<00:02:58.700> suggest

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
the system requirements would suggest

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.759 
the system requirements would suggest
that<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.540> not<00:02:59.690> going<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> require<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
that that it's not going to require the

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.380 
that that it's not going to require the
most<00:03:00.980> ridiculous<00:03:01.519> machine<00:03:01.910> out<00:03:02.060> there<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.299> know

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
most ridiculous machine out there I know

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.089 
most ridiculous machine out there I know
an<00:03:02.630> Arkham<00:03:02.989> Knight<00:03:03.140> system<00:03:03.470> requirements<00:03:03.980> got

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
an Arkham Knight system requirements got

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.770 
an Arkham Knight system requirements got
released<00:03:04.370> they<00:03:04.519> were<00:03:04.580> really<00:03:04.970> really<00:03:05.299> hefty<00:03:05.450> I

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
released they were really really hefty I

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.330 
released they were really really hefty I
think<00:03:06.260> for<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.440> Ultra<00:03:06.709> requirements<00:03:07.250> they

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
think for the Ultra requirements they

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.920 
think for the Ultra requirements they
were<00:03:07.400> saying<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.760> gtx<00:03:08.180> 980<00:03:08.630> if<00:03:08.780> i'm<00:03:08.900> not

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
were saying a gtx 980 if i'm not

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.320 
were saying a gtx 980 if i'm not
mistaken<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:09.560> yeah<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.180> not

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
mistaken so yeah this is this is not

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.030 
mistaken so yeah this is this is not
doesn't<00:03:11.810> look<00:03:11.900> like<00:03:11.989> it's<00:03:12.110> going<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.380> be<00:03:12.620> that

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
doesn't look like it's going to be that

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.830 
doesn't look like it's going to be that
much<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.489> graphical<00:03:13.940> masterpiece<00:03:14.480> compared

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
much of a graphical masterpiece compared

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.300 
much of a graphical masterpiece compared
to<00:03:14.930> like<00:03:15.019> arkham<00:03:15.320> knight<00:03:15.470> or<00:03:15.620> at<00:03:15.709> least<00:03:15.890> it's

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
to like arkham knight or at least it's

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.830 
to like arkham knight or at least it's
going<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.609> be<00:03:16.670> better<00:03:16.820> optimized<00:03:17.329> than<00:03:17.540> Arkham

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
going to be better optimized than Arkham

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.810 
going to be better optimized than Arkham
Knight<00:03:17.989> anyway<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.370> minimum<00:03:19.640> system

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
Knight anyway so the minimum system

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.849 
Knight anyway so the minimum system
requirements<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.660> think<00:03:20.900> most<00:03:21.230> people<00:03:21.590> should

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.800

be<00:03:22.010> able<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.370> obtain<00:03:22.609> or<00:03:23.000> already<00:03:23.120> have<00:03:23.359> pcs

be able to obtain or already have pcs

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.780 
be able to obtain or already have pcs
that<00:03:23.840> can<00:03:24.109> probably<00:03:24.320> run<00:03:24.739> this<00:03:24.890> game<00:03:25.130> at<00:03:25.400> least
