and<00:04:10.500> stand<00:04:11.500> them<00:04:11.620> up<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:12.099> you<00:04:12.400> know<00:04:12.519> standing

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
and stand them up so you know standing

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.520 
and stand them up so you know standing
up<00:04:13.030> figures<00:04:13.479> when<00:04:13.750> you're<00:04:13.900> transforming<00:04:14.439> them

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
up figures when you're transforming them

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.469 
up figures when you're transforming them
makes<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:14.889> lot<00:04:14.979> easier<00:04:15.159> we<00:04:16.060> pan<00:04:16.269> up<00:04:16.299> the

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
makes it a lot easier we pan up the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.949 
makes it a lot easier we pan up the
camera

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959

you<00:06:16.880> know<00:06:16.970> you<00:06:17.090> can<00:06:17.240> move<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.600> basic<00:06:17.930> horn

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
you know you can move the basic horn

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.100 
you know you can move the basic horn
basic<00:06:18.620> elbow<00:06:18.980> you<00:06:19.490> can<00:06:19.520> move<00:06:20.480> the<00:06:20.600> hand<00:06:20.840> up<00:06:20.960> and

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
basic elbow you can move the hand up and

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.900 
basic elbow you can move the hand up and
down<00:06:21.290> but<00:06:21.590> that's<00:06:22.100> almost<00:06:22.370> it<00:06:22.580> you<00:06:22.700> can't

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
down but that's almost it you can't

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.900 
down but that's almost it you can't
rotate<00:06:23.060> it<00:06:23.360> fortunately<00:06:24.290> he's<00:06:25.190> got<00:06:25.400> little

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
rotate it fortunately he's got little

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.310 
rotate it fortunately he's got little
foot<00:06:26.330> moving<00:06:26.660> I<00:06:26.780> guess<00:06:26.930> you<00:06:27.050> could<00:06:27.200> consider

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
foot moving I guess you could consider

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.250 
foot moving I guess you could consider
that<00:06:27.710> his<00:06:27.860> foot<00:06:28.100> some<00:06:28.970> band<00:06:29.570> that<00:06:29.720> they<00:06:29.870> need

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
that his foot some band that they need

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.070 
that his foot some band that they need
and<00:06:30.620> move<00:06:31.250> up<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:31.670> leg<00:06:31.850> up<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.180> down<00:06:32.270> you

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
and move up the leg up and down you

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.720 
and move up the leg up and down you
can't<00:06:33.350> actually<00:06:33.500> move<00:06:33.770> the<00:06:33.920> waist<00:06:34.130> which<00:06:34.580> is

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
can't actually move the waist which is

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.090 
can't actually move the waist which is
partly<00:06:35.180> transformation<00:06:35.900> but<00:06:36.710> of<00:06:36.800> course

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
partly transformation but of course

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.970 
partly transformation but of course
since<00:06:37.460> is<00:06:37.880> you<00:06:38.540> know<00:06:41.260> you<00:06:42.260> cannot<00:06:42.560> move<00:06:42.920> the

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
since is you know you cannot move the

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.940 
since is you know you cannot move the
head<00:06:43.460> unfortunately<00:06:44.390> he<00:06:44.630> is<00:06:44.810> stuck<00:06:45.230> you<00:06:45.860> know

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
head unfortunately he is stuck you know

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.130 
head unfortunately he is stuck you know
I<00:06:45.980> could<00:06:46.190> kind<00:06:46.340> of<00:06:46.460> toggle<00:06:46.670> like<00:06:47.000> so<00:06:47.240> but<00:06:47.900> you

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
I could kind of toggle like so but you

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.710 
I could kind of toggle like so but you
can<00:06:48.170> actually<00:06:48.770> move<00:06:48.980> the<00:06:49.250> head<00:06:49.520> that<00:06:50.510> really

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
can actually move the head that really
