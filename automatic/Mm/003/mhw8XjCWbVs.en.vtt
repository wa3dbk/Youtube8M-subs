00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
like a brushed metal you can also see

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
like a brushed metal you can also see
the<00:00:41.129> redesign<00:00:41.700> volume<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.629> keys

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the lock button which looks quite nice

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.389 
the lock button which looks quite nice
little<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:49.260> premium<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> ask<00:00:50.190> me

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
little bit more premium if you ask me

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
little bit more premium if you ask me
personally<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.360> also<00:00:51.510> looks<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
personally it also looks like it's a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160 
personally it also looks like it's a
little<00:00:52.649> bit<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:53.270> even<00:00:54.270> less<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
little bit more even less like the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
little bit more even less like the
vessels<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.760> this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
vessels and you can see that this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.959 
vessels and you can see that this
picture<00:00:57.449> also<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.079> bit<00:00:58.199> shaky<00:00:58.500> here

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
picture also is a little bit shaky here

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.250 
picture also is a little bit shaky here
but<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.329> some<00:01:00.449> other<00:01:00.570> specs<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:00.960> going

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
but we have some other specs here going

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.380 
but we have some other specs here going
on<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.399> might<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.820> device<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
on and we might see this device on

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
on and we might see this device on
mainly<00:01:03.719> 27th<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.650> that's<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.159> LG<00:01:05.460> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
mainly 27th because that's when LG is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
mainly 27th because that's when LG is
going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> event<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
going to have a event you can see is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
going to have a event you can see is

using right now to do this video on an
imac<00:01:41.909> 27-inch<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.140> pretty<00:01:43.320> insane<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
imac 27-inch so that's pretty insane and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.429 
imac 27-inch so that's pretty insane and
we<00:01:44.399> also<00:01:44.549> seeing<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> white<00:01:45.659> variant<00:01:46.110> and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
going to be add to the bottom there I

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.660 
going to be add to the bottom there I

it's<00:02:34.310> interesting<00:02:34.610> how<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.630> going<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.930> be

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
it's interesting how it is going to be

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.570 
it's interesting how it is going to be
like<00:02:36.200> bigger<00:02:36.500> than<00:02:37.100> all<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.460> other

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
like bigger than all of the other

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.060 
like bigger than all of the other
flagship<00:02:38.060> smartphones<00:02:38.600> like<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.080> galaxy<00:02:39.800> s5

regions like Falcon 2 inch and this

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.560 
regions like Falcon 2 inch and this
range<00:02:44.330> by<00:02:44.510> z2<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.050> 5<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.620> 2<00:02:45.890> inch<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:47.060> HTC

range by z2 is 5 and 2 inch and the HTC
One<00:02:48.050> m8<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.770> like<00:02:49.040> if<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.430> yeah<00:02:49.850> if<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.090> can

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
One m8 this like if I yeah if I can

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.530 
One m8 this like if I yeah if I can
remember<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:51.050> would<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.740> five<00:02:52.010> inch<00:02:52.540> so

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
remember it would it's like five inch so

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.390 
remember it would it's like five inch so
it's<00:02:53.930> quite<00:02:54.110> nice<00:02:54.290> actually<00:02:54.650> how<00:02:55.130> they<00:02:55.310> are

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
it's quite nice actually how they are

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400 
it's quite nice actually how they are
making<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.030> even<00:02:56.150> begin<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.990> if<00:02:57.110> it's<00:02:57.260> going

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
making it even begin and if it's going

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.370 
making it even begin and if it's going
to<00:02:57.470> be<00:02:57.590> even<00:02:57.740> less<00:02:57.980> vessels<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.110> going<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
to be even less vessels that is going to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.040 
to be even less vessels that is going to
be<00:03:00.500> even<00:03:00.650> better<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:02.420> then<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.900> might

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
be even better because then it might

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.140 
be even better because then it might
become<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:03.830> same<00:03:04.040> size<00:03:04.310> as<00:03:04.640> those<00:03:04.910> other

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
become like the same size as those other

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.140 
become like the same size as those other
phones<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:07.010> with<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> bigger<00:03:07.580> screen<00:03:07.670> and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
phones but with a bigger screen and

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.240 
phones but with a bigger screen and
that's<00:03:08.480> exactly<00:03:08.660> problem<00:03:09.410> what<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.650> want<00:03:09.890> to

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
