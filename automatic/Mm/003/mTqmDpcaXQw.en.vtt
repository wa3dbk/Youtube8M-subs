blah blah blah blah blah so that's

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.740 
blah blah blah blah blah so that's
pretty<00:04:29.980> much<00:04:30.040> where<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.400> ended<00:04:30.700> however<00:04:31.450> he'd

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
pretty much where it ended however he'd

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.660 
pretty much where it ended however he'd
only<00:04:31.930> put<00:04:32.230> his<00:04:32.350> window<00:04:32.650> down<00:04:32.680> about<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.370> much

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
only put his window down about this much

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.390 
only put his window down about this much
and<00:04:34.060> he<00:04:34.900> didn't<00:04:35.290> seem<00:04:35.470> very<00:04:35.500> willing<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.220> talk

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
and he didn't seem very willing to talk

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.130 
and he didn't seem very willing to talk
to<00:04:36.550> me<00:04:36.670> so<00:04:36.700> now<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.090> county<00:04:37.540> has<00:04:37.690> pictures<00:04:38.110> of

to me so now the county has pictures of
my<00:04:38.380> truck<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:39.000> which<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.120> guess<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.330> what<00:04:40.450> they

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
my truck of which I guess is what they

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.330 
my truck of which I guess is what they
wanted<00:04:40.930> anyways<00:04:41.320> but<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.740> seems<00:04:41.980> like<00:04:42.070> those

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
wanted anyways but it seems like those

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.790 
wanted anyways but it seems like those
two<00:04:42.610> incidences<00:04:43.150> are<00:04:43.360> not<00:04:43.660> connected<00:04:44.169> so

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
two incidences are not connected so

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.190 
two incidences are not connected so
we'll<00:04:45.130> just<00:04:45.160> see<00:04:45.550> what<00:04:45.669> happens<00:04:45.810> now<00:04:46.810> with<00:04:46.870> my

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
we'll just see what happens now with my

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.159 
we'll just see what happens now with my
truck<00:04:47.470> but<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:48.250> like<00:04:49.090> my<00:04:49.300> truck<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:49.750> like<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.050> way

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.620 
so I think that's it there you have it
if<00:05:29.950> you<00:05:30.220> disagree<00:05:30.760> with<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:30.940> county<00:05:31.300> stance

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630
