the<00:01:31.590> vertical<00:01:31.740> sync<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> first

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the vertical sync this is the first

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
the vertical sync this is the first
thing<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.009> guys<00:01:35.159> gonna<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.229> go

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
thing that you guys gonna do and then go

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.890 
thing that you guys gonna do and then go
and<00:01:37.350> test<00:01:37.590> PS<00:01:38.009> 2015<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> input

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and test PS 2015 and see that the input

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.889 
and test PS 2015 and see that the input
lag<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.320> indeed<00:01:40.590> gone<00:01:41.720> but<00:01:42.720> then

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
lag is indeed gone but then

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
lag is indeed gone but then
unfortunately<00:01:43.799> enough<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:44.850> experience

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
unfortunately enough you will experience

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.800 
unfortunately enough you will experience
excessive<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.560> screen<00:01:47.399> tearing<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> perhaps

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
excessive the screen tearing and perhaps

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.130 
excessive the screen tearing and perhaps
micro<00:01:49.740> stuttering<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
micro stuttering so this is not the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.520 
micro stuttering so this is not the
ideal<00:01:52.439> gameplay<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
ideal gameplay but you do have you you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.170 
ideal gameplay but you do have you you
can<00:01:55.740> indeed<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.790> no<00:01:56.969> input

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
can indeed see that there is no input

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.200 
can indeed see that there is no input
like<00:01:57.509> whatsoever<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.030> provide

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
setup so you can play without the input

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.670

put<00:03:05.019> that<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.379> 0<00:03:05.829> or<00:03:06.129> 1<00:03:06.459> you're<00:03:06.970> gonna<00:03:07.180> check

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
put that to 0 or 1 you're gonna check

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.190 
put that to 0 or 1 you're gonna check
you're<00:03:07.629> gonna<00:03:07.780> test<00:03:08.079> these<00:03:08.319> two<00:03:08.560> settings

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
you're gonna test these two settings

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.199 
you're gonna test these two settings
then<00:03:11.200> enable<00:03:11.859> triple<00:03:12.250> buffering<00:03:12.549> because<00:03:12.970> why

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
then enable triple buffering because why

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.909 
then enable triple buffering because why
not<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.650> then<00:03:15.250> there's<00:03:15.370> Vissing<00:03:15.909> so<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.919> told

that to prefer maximum performance don't

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.800 
that to prefer maximum performance don't
be<00:04:11.379> scared<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.889> what<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.370> does<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.730> just

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
be scared of it what it does it just

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.349 
be scared of it what it does it just
makes<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.989> card<00:04:14.260> made<00:04:14.980> makes<00:04:15.430> your<00:04:15.609> VGA<00:04:15.879> work

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
makes the card made makes your VGA work

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.029 
makes the card made makes your VGA work
as<00:04:16.599> its<00:04:17.049> default<00:04:17.349> clocks<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.039> memory<00:04:18.660> rates

to adaptive it might actually hinder the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.990 
to adaptive it might actually hinder the
performance<00:04:44.890> because<00:04:45.890> it<00:04:45.920> lowers<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.730> clocks

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
performance because it lowers the clocks

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.340 
performance because it lowers the clocks
of<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.240> card<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.750> thus<00:04:48.620> uses<00:04:49.580> 80%<00:04:50.060> or<00:04:50.540> 90%<00:04:50.570> of

of the card and thus uses 80% or 90% of

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.230 
of the card and thus uses 80% or 90% of
the<00:04:51.470> card<00:04:51.710> which<00:04:51.920> I'm<00:04:52.520> not<00:04:52.670> sure<00:04:52.880> when<00:04:53.090> it's

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
the card which I'm not sure when it's

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.600 
the card which I'm not sure when it's
the<00:04:53.360> best<00:04:53.600> because<00:04:53.930> it's<00:04:54.440> Nvidia<00:04:55.220> default

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
the best because it's Nvidia default

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.740

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
which is not good for our testing

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.580 
which is not good for our testing
because<00:05:49.550> we<00:05:50.120> want<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.479> test<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:51.080> vsync

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590

all<00:05:55.100> that<00:05:55.280> stuff<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:56.150> you<00:05:56.419> have<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.810> use<00:05:56.990> the

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
all that stuff so you have to use the

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.540 
all that stuff so you have to use the
full<00:05:57.350> screen<00:05:57.380> mode<00:05:57.650> for<00:05:57.830> now<00:05:58.190> but<00:05:59.050> after<00:06:00.050> the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
full screen mode for now but after the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.159 
full screen mode for now but after the
excessive<00:06:01.550> play<00:06:01.850> testing<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.510> have<00:06:02.570> actually

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
excessive play testing I have actually

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.750 
excessive play testing I have actually
found<00:06:03.350> that<00:06:03.560> those<00:06:03.800> settings<00:06:04.280> are<00:06:04.460> good

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
found that those settings are good

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.270 
found that those settings are good
enough<00:06:05.060> for<00:06:05.300> windowed<00:06:06.140> mode<00:06:06.410> as<00:06:06.620> well<00:06:06.860> which<00:06:07.100> I

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
enough for windowed mode as well which I

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.580 
enough for windowed mode as well which I
was<00:06:07.460> afraid<00:06:07.640> that<00:06:07.990> that<00:06:08.990> wasn't<00:06:09.260> available

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
was afraid that that wasn't available

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.250 
was afraid that that wasn't available
that<00:06:10.070> wasn't<00:06:10.430> I<00:06:10.820> wasn't<00:06:11.450> able<00:06:11.570> to<00:06:11.780> use<00:06:12.050> them

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
that wasn't I wasn't able to use them

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.640 
that wasn't I wasn't able to use them
but<00:06:12.440> I<00:06:13.570> thought<00:06:14.570> it<00:06:14.720> was<00:06:14.840> a<00:06:14.870> placebo<00:06:15.110> effect

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
but I thought it was a placebo effect

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.790 
but I thought it was a placebo effect
first<00:06:16.130> but<00:06:16.460> no<00:06:16.640> the<00:06:17.240> inputs<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:18.169> input<00:06:18.410> lag<00:06:18.620> is

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
first but no the inputs the input lag is

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.530 
first but no the inputs the input lag is
actually<00:06:19.220> gone<00:06:19.430> in<00:06:19.550> windowed<00:06:19.940> mode<00:06:20.090> as<00:06:20.330> well

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
actually gone in windowed mode as well

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.680 
actually gone in windowed mode as well
so<00:06:21.169> experienced<00:06:22.070> users<00:06:22.370> can<00:06:23.210> use<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.479> in

so experienced users can use that in

so experienced users can use that in
