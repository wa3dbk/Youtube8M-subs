you but these guys they did just the
opposite<00:00:45.109> scad<00:00:46.109> from<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.679> can<00:00:46.800> tell<00:00:47.249> is<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
opposite scad from what I can tell is a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.470 
opposite scad from what I can tell is a
catch-all<00:00:49.230> term<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.460> number<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.920> types<00:00:52.920> of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.000 

it's<00:02:46.390> definitely<00:02:46.689> one<00:02:47.349> of<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.500> most<00:02:47.620> fun

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
