the<00:00:07.210> final<00:00:07.629> stage<00:00:07.899> of<00:00:08.049> the<00:00:08.170> camerin

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
the final stage of the camerin

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.500 
the final stage of the camerin
conversion<00:00:09.219> process<00:00:09.700> is<00:00:09.730> known<00:00:10.180> as<00:00:10.360> the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
conversion process is known as the

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.320 
conversion process is known as the
birthing<00:00:10.990> chamber<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:12.280> cocoons<00:00:12.639> are<00:00:12.879> opened

birthing chamber the cocoons are opened

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.109 
birthing chamber the cocoons are opened
and<00:00:13.510> new<00:00:13.779> kumara<00:00:14.260> are<00:00:14.500> born<00:00:14.770> in<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:15.730> case<00:00:15.910> of

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
and new kumara are born in the case of

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.269 
and new kumara are born in the case of
hybrids<00:00:16.600> a<00:00:16.779> cooling<00:00:17.199> apparatus<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:17.980> fused

hybrids a cooling apparatus is fused

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.349 
hybrids a cooling apparatus is fused
into<00:00:18.490> their<00:00:18.699> bodies

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
into their bodies

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.690 
into their bodies
the<00:00:19.810> camerin<00:00:20.289> metabolism<00:00:20.949> is<00:00:21.070> roughly<00:00:21.369> twelve

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
the camerin metabolism is roughly twelve

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.190 
the camerin metabolism is roughly twelve
times<00:00:22.000> that<00:00:22.270> of<00:00:22.450> humans

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
times that of humans

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.290 
times that of humans
this<00:00:23.650> results<00:00:24.220> in<00:00:24.310> remarkable<00:00:24.910> healing

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
this results in remarkable healing

this results in remarkable healing
abilities<00:00:25.750> but<00:00:26.289> also<00:00:26.470> raises<00:00:27.070> their<00:00:27.250> body

temperatures<00:00:28.030> significantly<00:00:28.750> without<00:00:29.680> the

cooling apparatus the hybrids would

00:00:31.630 --> 00:02:28.990 
cooling apparatus the hybrids would
overheat<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.379> die

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000 

yeah
