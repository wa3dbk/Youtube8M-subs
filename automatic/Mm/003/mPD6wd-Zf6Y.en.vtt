that position after you find your
balance<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.950> you'll<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.489> surprised<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
balance here you'll be surprised what a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
balance here you'll be surprised what a
secure<00:00:42.750> position<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:44.370> actually

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
secure position it is it's actually

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
secure position it is it's actually
pretty<00:00:45.090> easy<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.480> stay<00:00:45.870> balanced<00:00:46.410> over<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
pretty easy to stay balanced over the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
pretty easy to stay balanced over the
front<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> horse<00:00:50.239> Goodley<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.480> horses

stopped<00:00:52.199> quite<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> bit<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> rider<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

first<00:00:53.820> doing<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.270> exercise<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
first doing this exercise I think it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
first doing this exercise I think it
happens<00:00:56.550> mostly<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.239> they're<00:00:57.600> worried

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
happens mostly because they're worried

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.260 
happens mostly because they're worried
about<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.260> rider<00:00:58.469> falling<00:00:58.890> forward<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.730> also

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
about the rider falling forward and also

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.939 
about the rider falling forward and also
because<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> saddle<00:01:01.140> puts<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.590> bit<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
because the saddle puts a little bit of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.789 
because the saddle puts a little bit of
pressure<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.550> their<00:01:02.760> weather

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
pressure on their weather

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.890 
pressure on their weather
Faith's<00:01:04.799> mom<00:01:05.159> lisa<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.850> doing<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.540> good

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
Faith's mom lisa is doing a really good

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
Faith's mom lisa is doing a really good
job<00:01:07.140> walking<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> large<00:01:08.310> circle<00:01:08.700> which

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
job walking on a large circle which

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
job walking on a large circle which
makes<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> easier<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.170> glory<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> keep

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
makes it easier for glory to keep

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000 
makes it easier for glory to keep
trotting<00:01:11.600> Laurie<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:12.810> has<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.409> easier<00:01:13.799> time

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
trotting Laurie also has an easier time

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
trotting Laurie also has an easier time
tracking<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> left<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> right

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
tracking to the left then to the right

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.080 
tracking to the left then to the right
her<00:01:16.560> balance<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.220> bit<00:01:17.580> better<00:01:17.759> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
her balance is a little bit better this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
her balance is a little bit better this
way<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.930> makes<00:01:19.170> sense<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.590> most

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
way which makes sense because most

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
way which makes sense because most
horses<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.670> left-handed<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.509> opposed<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
horses are left-handed as opposed to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.580 
horses are left-handed as opposed to
right-handed<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.960> think<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> riders

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
right-handed I think a lot of riders

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.950 
right-handed I think a lot of riders
also<00:01:26.100> develop<00:01:26.729> preferences<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.720> tracking

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
also develop preferences for tracking

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
also develop preferences for tracking
left<00:01:28.380> after<00:01:29.100> they've<00:01:29.280> ridden<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> long

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
time they too seem to have better

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
time they too seem to have better
balance<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> left<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> only

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
balance going to the left which is only

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.539 
balance going to the left which is only
logical<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.079> rider's<00:01:37.380> body<00:01:37.650> surely

logical as the rider's body surely

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.910 
logical as the rider's body surely
develops<00:01:39.000> over<00:01:39.450> time<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:40.380> fit<00:01:40.590> better<00:01:40.799> with
