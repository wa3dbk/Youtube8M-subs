00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
and the bird-like senses that they're

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.890 
and the bird-like senses that they're
out<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.100> egg<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.520> they<00:04:34.360> must<00:04:34.570> have<00:04:34.690> some

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
out of the egg and they must have some

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.060 
out of the egg and they must have some
sort<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.080> telepathy<00:04:35.320> going<00:04:35.650> on<00:04:35.800> because<00:04:35.890> then

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
sort of telepathy going on because then

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.800 
sort of telepathy going on because then
the<00:04:36.160> bird<00:04:36.340> comes<00:04:36.640> back<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.150> picks<00:04:37.600> up<00:04:37.690> a
