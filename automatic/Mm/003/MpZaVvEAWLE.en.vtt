 special rate 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.789
 know how to attack and defend at the right time 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.789
 do not give debt 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.659

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.280
 Special 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.280
 this one 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.239
 personal attacks do not do it right 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.540
 meaning for example the painting talked 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.989
 the guy simply another 3d game 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.989

 It's cool that you develop here is kind 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.120
 a competition not who likes to show 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.030
 the chest these things is who gets the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.890
 best score yet made complete with 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.590
 Your movie friend gets the best. 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:02.980
 score in the game and this gives more grace 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:05.470
 was was still going to have the game is not 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.770
 complete so totally the galette more 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.320
 chapters that are going to leave today I played 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.520
 so it does not and in the end is not complete the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:22.180
 sun sent met a dozen million 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:24.520
 the right choice and reflexes will also 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.730
 themes that pays to play a game very much 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.730

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.990

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.990

 I'll try to survive here. 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.560
 the four tires received it 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.080
 It seems like I've gone through the first chapter. 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.700
 I have to admit that she was the game 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.710
 It's kind of short but it 's pretty cool here. 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.050
 then go on your score who 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.840
 get better reputation first 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.440
 place but of course you already know right 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:39.500
 that the ones here are all boring 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.500
 it is right to have that same crowd 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.520

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.100
