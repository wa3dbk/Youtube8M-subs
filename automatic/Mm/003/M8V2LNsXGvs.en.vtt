00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.520
 Today we show you how to stakes 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.340
 really fries 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.500
 because a steak can only succeed if the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.650
 meat quality is correct we only use 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.219
 the best of the best wonderfully tender 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.219
 beef tenderloin 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.140
 For frying we use a frying pan 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.030
 with a flat bottom or a grip flag 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.130
 All are suitable for this 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.620
 strong heat like cast iron and 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.660
 stainless steel or coated pans 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.340
 We also need a barbecue tongs 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.000
 a meat thermometer 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.000
 olive oil 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.800
 foil and 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.059
 buck rust 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.280
 use today as a flat 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.040
 frying pan and heat about five 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.350
 minutes on the hot plate before to 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.360
 we take a high volume of oil 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.120
 such as sunflowers or 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.489
 olive oil the oil does not come in the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.680
 but is used to the pan 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.800
 to steak on both sides 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 more oil is not necessary has also 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.009
 that the advantage that the oil is not 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.680
 splashes when you put the meat in the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.540
 does not use a fork 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.039
 to put the stacks in the pan because 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.570
 This will cause the surface of the 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.729
 meat hurt and the meat juice 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.710
 exit press the stacks 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.179
 Instead, carefully in the pan like that 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.470
 that you quickly get a nice color 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.119
 accept and the typical 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.220
 incomparable consultant aroma 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.720
 Develop the pan has the right one 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.759
 temperature when the meat at 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.950
 put it in sizzling and hissing 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.060
 we fry the stakes for about one 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.130
 minute on 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.950
 then we turn them over and roast them off 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.940
 the other side will last too 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.070
 spice up the sides briefly all around 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.200
 she does not yet extract salt from it 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.090
 meat the water and pepper can at 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.310
 lightly burn this strong heat 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.989
 now the take must be according to the desired 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.119
 even stage fried differently for a long time 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.259
 will be to detect the gas level 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.429
 we need a little bit 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.950
 flair 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.300
 Make the thumb bale test if 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.130
 Her index finger on her thumb 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.890
 Laying it feels like a bale 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.479
 steak the gas level bloody use them 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.399
 instead of showing the middle finger like that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.739
 you know what a steak feels like 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.420
 The English medium is served the 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.489
 same test with the ring finger gives 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.099
 them the feeling for the stage even by 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.959
 if they prefer not to 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.370
 want to leave your fingertip feeling 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.260
 so you can also have a meat 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.920
 Thermometer use around the temperature 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.349
 to determine the stakes 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 this makes the stacks easy 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.130
 damaged now we take out the steaks 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.450
 Wrap the pan in aluminum foil 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.730
 Put it on the grid and push 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.170
 the rust at 60 degrees for five to six 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.120
 minutes in the oven 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.459
 There, the stacks can relax 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.610
 while the meat juice is inside 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.510
 the meat is finally distributed 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.260

 now the meat can be seasoned 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.170
 Coarse-grained sea ​​salt is suitable for this purpose 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.910
 especially good 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.970
 Of course, a pinch of pepper is also allowed
