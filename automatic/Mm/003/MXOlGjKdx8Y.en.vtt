 delighted with acrobatics

 jumpers into the water she decided to experience 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.970
 small vodka 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.040

 medal and don't even know was lena not 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.899
 probably already when there was 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.140
 the most complicated program 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.330
 jumps 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.670

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.410
 have no fear new when but we 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.230
 let's jump some business up for 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.230
 me that's scary so here's a little bit 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.230
 rubles it fall at the meeting does not receive 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.780
 to this edge is permissible but unfortunate to all 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.090

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.380
 overshadowed injuries 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.590

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.989
 Julia used to cope with her 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.290
