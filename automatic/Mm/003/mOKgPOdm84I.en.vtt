have a novice cameraman today so on the
point<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.420> computer<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.899> very<00:01:01.079> very

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
point is this computer is very very

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.009 
point is this computer is very very
quiet<00:01:01.800> even<00:01:02.399> under<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> full<00:01:03.180> gaming<00:01:03.570> load<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
quiet even under a full gaming load so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
quiet even under a full gaming load so
it's<00:01:04.140> using<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> fractal<00:01:04.890> design<00:01:05.040> define<00:01:05.220> our

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's using a fractal design define our

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
it's using a fractal design define our
three<00:01:06.060> case<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.960> means<00:01:07.140> you've<00:01:07.290> got<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> front

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
three case that means you've got a front

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
kind of a brushed matte finish on it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.780 
kind of a brushed matte finish on it
inside<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:12.930> got<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.170> DVD<00:01:13.560> writer<00:01:13.920> we've<00:01:14.520> got

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
inside we've got a DVD writer we've got

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.910 
inside we've got a DVD writer we've got
room<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.270> another<00:01:15.299> optical<00:01:15.840> drive<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.500> r3<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
room for another optical drive the r3 is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
room for another optical drive the r3 is
slightly<00:01:17.310> revised<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.030> has<00:01:18.180> kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> these

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
slightly revised so it has kind of these

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
slightly revised so it has kind of these
cool<00:01:18.900> five<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> quarter<00:01:19.590> inch<00:01:19.830> Bay<00:01:20.009> covers

that<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:22.560> hinge<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:22.979> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that have a little little hinge here so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.410 
that have a little little hinge here so
you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.549> lock<00:01:23.700> them<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you can just lock them in just like that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.870 
you can just lock them in just like that
you've<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> couple<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.920> removable<00:01:26.520> fan

you've got a couple of removable fan
filters<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> front<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.770> populated

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
filters on the front so it's populated

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.580 
filters on the front so it's populated
by<00:01:29.520> default<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.060> 11<00:01:30.479> 20<00:01:30.780> millimeter<00:01:31.140> fan<00:01:31.380> and

when<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.799> open<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> inside<00:01:32.610> you'll<00:01:32.850> see

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
when we open up the inside you'll see

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
when we open up the inside you'll see
that<00:01:33.500> NCIX<00:01:34.500> installs<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.189> three<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> half

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that NCIX installs the three and a half

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429 
that NCIX installs the three and a half
inch<00:01:35.880> drive<00:01:36.180> behind<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.780> fans<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
inch drive behind the fans so that it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.140 
inch drive behind the fans so that it
gets<00:01:37.530> optimal<00:01:37.979> cooling<00:01:38.369> you've<00:01:38.820> got<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.119> your

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
gets optimal cooling you've got all your

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
gets optimal cooling you've got all your
sound<00:01:39.540> dampening<00:01:39.930> materials<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.740> behind

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
sound dampening materials here behind

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
sound dampening materials here behind
the<00:01:41.159> door<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> quick<00:01:42.689> look

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the door just want to have a quick look

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.109 
the door just want to have a quick look
at<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> define<00:01:44.640> our<00:01:44.790> three<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
at that so the define our three is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
at that so the define our three is
basically<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> define<00:01:46.290> our<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:46.890> i

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
basically like the define our to which i

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
basically like the define our to which i
unboxed<00:01:47.850> quite<00:01:48.060> some<00:01:48.299> time<00:01:48.509> ago<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.110> was

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
unboxed quite some time ago and it was

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
unboxed quite some time ago and it was
first<00:01:49.470> released<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.950> north<00:01:50.159> america<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.180> let's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
first released in north america so let's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.520 
first released in north america so let's
run<00:01:51.479> around<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> look<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
run around here and have a look at the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
run around here and have a look at the
back<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> system<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> has<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> 550<00:01:54.689> watt

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
back of the system so it has a 550 watt

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.170 
back of the system so it has a 550 watt
power<00:01:55.079> supply<00:01:55.219> it's<00:01:56.219> powered<00:01:56.520> by<00:01:56.670> an<00:01:56.729> MSI

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
power supply it's powered by an MSI

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
power supply it's powered by an MSI
motherboard<00:01:57.390> which<00:01:57.899> features<00:01:58.229> USB<00:01:58.710> 3.0<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
motherboard which features USB 3.0 and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
motherboard which features USB 3.0 and
you<00:02:00.119> can't<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> inside<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you can't see it but on the inside it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.740 
you can't see it but on the inside it
actually<00:02:02.040> has<00:02:02.189> SATA<00:02:02.490> 6<00:02:02.790> gigabit<00:02:03.210> per<00:02:03.360> second

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
actually has SATA 6 gigabit per second

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.370 
actually has SATA 6 gigabit per second
to<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:05.070> too<00:02:05.399> as<00:02:05.670> well<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.079> means<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to so not too as well so that means that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.210 
to so not too as well so that means that
you've<00:02:07.500> got<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> latest

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you've got all of the latest

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.040 
you've got all of the latest
technologies<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.330> particular<00:02:09.509> system

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
technologies on this particular system

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.530 
technologies on this particular system
and<00:02:10.470> why<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.580> open<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.970> up

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and why don't we open it up

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.819 
and why don't we open it up
and<00:02:13.250> have<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.310> look<00:02:14.519> at<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> inside<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
and have a look at the inside so the

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.380 
and have a look at the inside so the
target<00:02:17.189> price<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.670> system<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.269> to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
target price of the system is going to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.740 
target price of the system is going to
be<00:02:18.480> about<00:02:18.599> 899<00:02:19.439> Canadian<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.569> what<00:02:21.569> that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
be about 899 Canadian and what that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.860 
be about 899 Canadian and what that
means<00:02:22.049> is<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> dual-core

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
means is that you get a dual-core

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.209 
means is that you get a dual-core
processor<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.200> only<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.739> be<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.920> core

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
processor it's only going to be a core

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.270 
processor it's only going to be a core
i3<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:26.879> as<00:02:27.409> most<00:02:28.409> people<00:02:28.739> know<00:02:28.769> when<00:02:29.129> you're

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
i3 but as most people know when you're

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
i3 but as most people know when you're
gaming<00:02:29.489> at<00:02:29.700> high<00:02:29.879> resolution<00:02:30.090> HD<00:02:30.689> resolutions

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
gaming at high resolution HD resolutions

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.490 
gaming at high resolution HD resolutions
usually<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.819> CPU<00:02:33.359> is<00:02:33.599> not<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.019> bottleneck

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
usually the CPU is not the bottleneck

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.830 
usually the CPU is not the bottleneck
and<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:35.129> usually<00:02:35.280> comes<00:02:35.640> down<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> GPU<00:02:36.510> so

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
and it usually comes down to the GPU so

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.259 
and it usually comes down to the GPU so
that's<00:02:37.019> why<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.500> focused<00:02:37.950> more<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.489> putting<00:02:39.180> a

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
that's why we focused more on putting a

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.420 
that's why we focused more on putting a
very<00:02:39.510> very<00:02:39.810> powerful<00:02:40.079> graphics<00:02:40.590> card<00:02:41.069> in<00:02:41.220> here

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
very very powerful graphics card in here

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.490 
very very powerful graphics card in here
and<00:02:41.609> building<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.389> system<00:02:42.750> around<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.290> now

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
and building the system around that now

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.830 
and building the system around that now
this<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.889> an<00:02:44.069> sli<00:02:44.489> ready<00:02:44.519> motherboard<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:45.720> it's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
this is an sli ready motherboard so it's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.240 
this is an sli ready motherboard so it's
going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.989> be<00:02:46.079> also<00:02:46.319> available<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.159> a

the<00:03:09.870> system<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:11.730> still<00:03:12.000> quite<00:03:12.359> quiet<00:03:12.750> so

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
the system it's still quite quiet so

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.509 
the system it's still quite quiet so
even<00:03:13.439> when<00:03:13.560> you're<00:03:13.739> gaming<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.189> don't<00:03:14.340> have

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
even when you're gaming you don't have

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.640 
even when you're gaming you don't have
to<00:03:14.639> worry<00:03:14.790> about<00:03:14.909> excess<00:03:15.359> noise<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.470> can

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
to worry about excess noise and you can

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.869 
to worry about excess noise and you can
see<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.949> GPU<00:03:17.340> runs<00:03:17.609> out<00:03:17.849> of<00:03:17.879> cool<00:03:18.180> 62<00:03:18.959> degrees

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
see the GPU runs out of cool 62 degrees

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.449 
see the GPU runs out of cool 62 degrees
peaking<00:03:20.879> at<00:03:21.000> 66<00:03:21.750> even<00:03:22.199> with<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.530> case<00:03:22.769> closed

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
peaking at 66 even with the case closed

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.909 
peaking at 66 even with the case closed
and<00:03:23.849> never<00:03:24.419> goes<00:03:24.659> over<00:03:24.989> about<00:03:25.199> seventy<00:03:25.650> six

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
and never goes over about seventy six

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.710 
and never goes over about seventy six
percent<00:03:26.340> fan<00:03:26.579> speeds<00:03:26.909> so<00:03:27.090> even<00:03:27.329> if<00:03:27.449> we<00:03:27.540> turn

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
percent fan speeds so even if we turn

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.219 
percent fan speeds so even if we turn
off<00:03:27.870> after<00:03:28.229> burner<00:03:28.409> so<00:03:29.250> let's<00:03:29.459> do<00:03:29.669> that<00:03:29.819> and

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:30.229 
off after burner so let's do that and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.899 
off after burner so let's do that and
cameraman<00:03:31.229> za<00:03:31.590> phone<00:03:31.859> is<00:03:32.069> going<00:03:32.250> off<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:32.699> so

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
cameraman za phone is going off here so

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.849 
cameraman za phone is going off here so
there<00:03:33.060> he<00:03:33.209> turned<00:03:33.419> it<00:03:33.540> off<00:03:33.629> good<00:03:33.930> work<00:03:34.079> okay<00:03:34.799> so

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
there he turned it off good work okay so

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.349 
there he turned it off good work okay so
when<00:03:35.099> we<00:03:35.220> turn<00:03:35.400> off<00:03:35.519> after<00:03:35.879> Runa<00:03:36.090> you're<00:03:36.239> going

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
when we turn off after Runa you're going

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.550 
when we turn off after Runa you're going
to<00:03:36.419> see<00:03:36.569> it's<00:03:36.690> actually<00:03:36.989> going<00:03:37.109> to<00:03:37.229> get<00:03:37.349> quite

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
to see it's actually going to get quite

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.830 
to see it's actually going to get quite
a<00:03:37.590> bit<00:03:37.769> quieter<00:03:38.220> still<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.819> as<00:03:39.659> I<00:03:39.810> mentioned

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
a bit quieter still and as I mentioned

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.689 
a bit quieter still and as I mentioned
before<00:03:40.229> we<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.979> hard<00:03:41.159> drive<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.519> it's<00:03:41.669> a

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
before we have the hard drive so it's a

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.490 
before we have the hard drive so it's a
one<00:03:41.940> terabyte<00:03:42.299> hard<00:03:42.780> drive<00:03:42.959> no<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.139> believe

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
one terabyte hard drive no I believe

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.409 
one terabyte hard drive no I believe
it's<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.769> 500<00:03:44.310> gig<00:03:44.459> hard<00:03:44.489> drive<00:03:44.699> no<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.239> one

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
it's a 500 gig hard drive no it is a one

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.659 
it's a 500 gig hard drive no it is a one
terabyte<00:03:45.629> hard<00:03:46.019> drive<00:03:46.229> by<00:03:46.440> default<00:03:46.799> install

terabyte hard drive by default install
down<00:03:47.879> here<00:03:48.090> at<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.209> bottom<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.599> can<00:03:48.629> actually

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
down here at the bottom you can actually

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.379 
down here at the bottom you can actually
install<00:03:49.260> up<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:50.159> eight<00:03:50.400> hard<00:03:50.790> drives<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.239> this

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
install up to eight hard drives in this

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.390 
install up to eight hard drives in this
case<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:52.290> with<00:03:52.530> all<00:03:52.709> of<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.949> expansion

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
case so with all of the expansion

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.949 
case so with all of the expansion
options<00:03:53.579> on<00:03:53.879> the<00:03:54.030> board<00:03:54.239> you've<00:03:54.449> got<00:03:54.629> six

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
options on the board you've got six

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.369 
options on the board you've got six
theta<00:03:55.199> 2<00:03:55.439> ports<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:56.549> say<00:03:56.879> 236<00:03:57.810> gigabit<00:03:58.229> per

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
theta 2 ports to say 236 gigabit per

theta 2 ports to say 236 gigabit per
second<00:03:58.739> ports<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.099> you're<00:03:59.220> probably<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.549> to

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
second ports so you're probably going to

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.250 
second ports so you're probably going to
use<00:03:59.760> one<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.000> those<00:04:00.150> for<00:04:00.449> your<00:04:00.569> DVD<00:04:00.930> or<00:04:01.019> blu-ray

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
use one of those for your DVD or blu-ray

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.259 
use one of those for your DVD or blu-ray
drive<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.919> then<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.459> can<00:04:02.609> have<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:02.879> to<00:04:02.909> six

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
drive and then you can have up to six

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.149 
drive and then you can have up to six

s in the top and then you can put an
additional<00:04:42.410> 120<00:04:42.830> millimeter<00:04:43.340> fan<00:04:43.610> in<00:04:43.850> the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
additional 120 millimeter fan in the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.910 
additional 120 millimeter fan in the
front<00:04:44.570> so<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.200> don't<00:04:45.440> care<00:04:45.680> about<00:04:45.800> the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
front so if you don't care about the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.340 
front so if you don't care about the
silent<00:04:46.430> aspect<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.450> actually<00:04:47.870> make<00:04:48.140> this

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
silent aspect you can actually make this

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.310 
silent aspect you can actually make this
case<00:04:48.650> all<00:04:48.920> about<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.490> cooling<00:04:49.820> performance

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
case all about the cooling performance

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.610 
case all about the cooling performance
instead<00:04:51.320> now<00:04:51.890> speaking<00:04:52.490> of<00:04:52.580> fan<00:04:53.060> filters

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
instead now speaking of fan filters

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.140 
instead now speaking of fan filters
you've<00:04:54.620> got<00:04:54.830> an<00:04:54.950> additional<00:04:55.370> 120<00:04:55.670> millimeter

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
you've got an additional 120 millimeter

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.790 
you've got an additional 120 millimeter
on<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.450> bottom<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:56.900> one's<00:04:57.230> filtered<00:04:57.680> and

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
on the bottom that one's filtered and

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.500 
on the bottom that one's filtered and
then<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.400> power<00:04:58.610> supply<00:04:58.880> uses<00:04:59.480> a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
then the power supply uses a

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.930 
then the power supply uses a
120-millimeter<00:05:00.140> fan<00:05:00.650> on<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:00.950> bottom<00:05:01.760> of<00:05:01.850> the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
120-millimeter fan on the bottom of the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.790 
120-millimeter fan on the bottom of the
power<00:05:02.120> supply<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:03.260> can<00:05:03.440> see<00:05:03.590> that's

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
power supply and you can see that's

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.460 
power supply and you can see that's
pulling<00:05:04.130> air<00:05:04.430> through<00:05:04.460> a<00:05:04.910> filtered<00:05:05.480> fan<00:05:06.140> hole

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
pulling air through a filtered fan hole

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.590 
pulling air through a filtered fan hole
right<00:05:06.830> on<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.100> bottom<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.580> case<00:05:07.790> again

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
right on the bottom of the case again

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.570 
right on the bottom of the case again
more<00:05:08.960> fan<00:05:09.170> filters<00:05:09.590> more<00:05:09.860> case<00:05:10.070> airflow<00:05:10.550> and

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
more fan filters more case airflow and

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.130 
more fan filters more case airflow and
it<00:05:10.880> make<00:05:11.030> sure<00:05:11.060> your<00:05:11.330> power<00:05:11.540> supply<00:05:11.720> stays

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
it make sure your power supply stays

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.930 
it make sure your power supply stays
nice<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.380> cool<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:12.740> this<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.280> system<00:05:13.760> that

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
nice and cool so this is a system that

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.680 
nice and cool so this is a system that
we're<00:05:14.810> pretty<00:05:14.990> proud<00:05:15.290> of<00:05:15.350> for<00:05:15.650> 899<00:05:16.100> so<00:05:16.690> check

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
we're pretty proud of for 899 so check

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.940 
we're pretty proud of for 899 so check
it<00:05:17.750> out<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:17.990> think<00:05:18.230> this<00:05:18.290> is<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.560> first<00:05:18.800> time

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
something that NCIX does on PCs even

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.300 
something that NCIX does on PCs even
though<00:05:23.300> that's<00:05:23.540> been<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.410> big<00:05:24.500> part<00:05:24.830> of<00:05:24.950> my<00:05:25.070> job

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
the silent aspects of this particular

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.880 
the silent aspects of this particular
NCIX<00:05:48.560> pc<00:05:50.200> one<00:05:51.200> other<00:05:51.290> thing<00:05:51.410> I<00:05:51.620> wanted<00:05:51.830> to

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
NCIX pc one other thing I wanted to

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.320 
NCIX pc one other thing I wanted to
mention<00:05:51.980> really<00:05:52.460> quick<00:05:52.640> I<00:05:52.760> talked<00:05:53.000> about<00:05:53.090> the

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
mention really quick I talked about the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.150 
mention really quick I talked about the
noise<00:05:53.480> dampening<00:05:53.750> material<00:05:54.140> inside<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.980> case

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
noise dampening material inside the case

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.950 
noise dampening material inside the case
but<00:05:55.790> I<00:05:55.850> want<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.180> cameraman<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.720> kind<00:05:56.900> of

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
but I want the cameraman to kind of

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.690 
but I want the cameraman to kind of
demonstrate<00:05:57.169> just<00:05:57.919> how<00:05:58.070> much<00:05:58.370> of<00:05:58.490> an<00:05:58.580> impact

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
demonstrate just how much of an impact

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.790 
demonstrate just how much of an impact
it<00:05:59.090> has<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.419> this<00:05:59.570> is<00:05:59.720> that<00:05:59.840> Idol<00:06:00.169> so<00:06:00.620> this<00:06:00.770> is

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
it has so this is that Idol so this is

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.470 
it has so this is that Idol so this is
if<00:06:01.040> you're<00:06:01.190> just<00:06:01.340> editing<00:06:01.790> Word<00:06:01.940> documents

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
if you're just editing Word documents

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.970 
if you're just editing Word documents
are<00:06:02.570> actually<00:06:03.020> doing<00:06:03.169> schoolwork<00:06:03.530> you<00:06:03.890> know

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
are actually doing schoolwork you know

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.150 
are actually doing schoolwork you know
on<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:04.250> internet<00:06:04.580> or<00:06:04.669> whatever<00:06:05.440> so<00:06:06.440> hopefully

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
on the internet or whatever so hopefully

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.740 
on the internet or whatever so hopefully
the<00:06:07.280> cameras<00:06:07.730> microphone<00:06:08.210> is<00:06:08.360> close<00:06:08.570> enough

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
the cameras microphone is close enough

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.240 
the cameras microphone is close enough
to<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.080> back<00:06:09.230> here<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:09.590> you<00:06:09.680> can<00:06:09.800> hear<00:06:10.040> some

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
to the back here that you can hear some

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.830 
to the back here that you can hear some
noise<00:06:10.460> coming<00:06:11.030> out<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.270> back<00:06:11.390> of<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.660> case

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
noise coming out the back of the case

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.740 
noise coming out the back of the case
and<00:06:12.790> then<00:06:13.790> I<00:06:13.970> want<00:06:14.090> the<00:06:14.270> hold<00:06:14.450> on<00:06:14.540> don't<00:06:14.720> move

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
and then I want the hold on don't move

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.290 
and then I want the hold on don't move
yet<00:06:14.960> but<00:06:15.800> on<00:06:15.980> my<00:06:16.340> mark<00:06:16.550> I<00:06:16.669> want<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:16.940> cameraman

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.450 
yet but on my mark I want the cameraman
to<00:06:17.480> move<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:17.720> camera<00:06:17.900> away<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.560> just<00:06:19.130> kind<00:06:19.400> of

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
to move the camera away and just kind of

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.950 
to move the camera away and just kind of
sit<00:06:19.640> it<00:06:19.760> next<00:06:19.970> to<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.180> side<00:06:20.450> panel<00:06:20.780> where

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
sit it next to the side panel where

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.300 
sit it next to the side panel where
there's<00:06:21.110> noise<00:06:21.320> dampening<00:06:21.560> material

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.290 

so<00:06:27.310> what<00:06:27.430> I'm<00:06:27.520> hoping<00:06:27.699> is<00:06:27.970> that<00:06:28.030> on<00:06:28.270> the

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
so what I'm hoping is that on the

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.700 
so what I'm hoping is that on the
YouTube<00:06:28.659> video<00:06:28.780> you'll<00:06:29.139> be<00:06:29.289> able<00:06:29.379> to<00:06:29.530> tell

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
YouTube video you'll be able to tell

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.320 
YouTube video you'll be able to tell
that<00:06:29.770> that's<00:06:30.009> quite<00:06:30.550> a<00:06:30.580> bit<00:06:30.759> quieter<00:06:31.120> and<00:06:31.240> we

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
that that's quite a bit quieter and we

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.399 
that that's quite a bit quieter and we
might<00:06:31.419> as<00:06:31.539> well<00:06:31.659> have<00:06:31.780> a<00:06:31.840> look<00:06:31.960> at<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.199> front

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
might as well have a look at the front

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.589 
might as well have a look at the front
panel<00:06:32.710> connectors<00:06:33.520> to<00:06:33.909> which<00:06:34.150> we<00:06:34.300> didn't<00:06:34.539> look

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
panel connectors to which we didn't look

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:35.490 
panel connectors to which we didn't look
at<00:06:34.750> before<00:06:34.900> so<00:06:35.139> you<00:06:35.229> got<00:06:35.349> headphones
