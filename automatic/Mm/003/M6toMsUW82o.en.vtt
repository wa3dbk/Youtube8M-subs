 turf tv I am delighted to welcome you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.059
 for a new show received five on 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.500
 five 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.000
 today to accompany me kind 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
 is mathieu footballer hello mathieu 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
 hello lucie hello everyone we go so 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.570
 floor today on the price of arras 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.760
 Sunday's event in vincennes on 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.460
 the 2700 meters of the big track 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.109
 they are eighteen starters from 7 to 10 years old 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.670
 to start so it's horses that we 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.199
 still knows pretty much overall 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 these are well-known topics of 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.579
 turfists for a Sunday and 1.50 and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.010
 who is really on the road to the basics 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.600
 solid enough stands out so no I 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.280
 think we should not be typing 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 okay right now we're going to listen 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.730
 your prognosis please then 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.399
 I placed number 4 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.090
 universal riders tops the ultra set 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 Danish on the 14th of the 20th on the 17th of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.219
 world the 5 inches and the water softened the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.649
 two Gascon universes 3 ura bottom of the bridge 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.210
 and the 6th theo of the rats very well so 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 in the lead you rank the number 4 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 universal ryder who won well on this 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 sound bus route this is a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119
 quality horse that has always been 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.890
 spared by his coach michel ans 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 what are we impressed like that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.950
 in his boxes we take care of him 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.060
 that's exactly what he does on the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.700
 really presents wisely 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 he brilliantly won him the quintÃ© that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 which you were talking about to go down in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.950
 winning head and rope that day after at 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.990
 cannes he put the cover back in a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 lot a little less raised the last time 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.439
 it was in 2006 in cannes he was out 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.570
 distance so we will not condemn especially 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.770
 not on this attempt we can this 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.110
 course was to bring him to 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 top for this race aimed mathieu 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.049
 mottier gets along perfectly with it 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.130
 is rarely deferred from the four but 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.990
 when he is he is transformed 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.790
 literally it's the second time there 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 I'm counting that's what I did 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.770
 race paper 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.090
 there are not many horses for 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.590
 go ahead I think we should not 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.659
 tactical entanglement with him on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.909
 should let's do yes I think that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.770
 if he can print a sustained train is 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.549
 went to his hand will have to take out the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.500
 great game to beat him 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.580
 okay good it's a very solid foundation 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.750
 I think in the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.520
 attic of Europe to move agree 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.320
 behind you rank the number 7 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.420
 ultra danish so here it's a little 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.670
 bigeon form too here are the volitional visions 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.780
 as they say he was absent from the tracks 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.000
 a little moment 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.010
 he had shown very young ways 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.090
 in his career there he finds the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.630
 fullness of his means as 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.790
 attested 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.200
 this recent second place behind 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.850
 a royal resident the resident of a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.410
 crutch was downgraded day there he 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.820
 given a good kick so I think 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.890
 that he is now really close to 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.750
 sound of his best he is a son 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.810
 of flower jasmine we know that at each 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.520
 times his boarders are really 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.560
 very very well it will be deferrÃ© of 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.300
 later as the last time to 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.550
 the outcome of a good journey I think 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.590
 it's the same it seems to me a solid 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.930
 fulcrum in the gers is fine 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.090
 just behind you rank the number 14 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.890
 twenty so he's going very very well 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.180
 on the French Riviera right now here we are 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.650
 spoke of the boarder of christian 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.330
 bigeon before but she's a boarder 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.550
 of christophe martens and brothers 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.200
 martens forgiveness also keeps getting 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.060
 distinguish the last time in the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.560
 quintÃ© it's in his head and he gets 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.510
 find a bit far we said that 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.680
 can be complicated to win but they 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.450
 had really traced a superb 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.180
 last mile he walks and a small 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.040
 14 that day landais make four 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.500
 feet for the first time point to 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.060
 what marten brothers have a small 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.410
 stubborn of his aptitude for 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.850
 great track he's never too much 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.769
 succeeded on large panels of 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.910
 vincennes but ouf it's the same when 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.220
 they undo four feet at each 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.840
 it's really terrible 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.090
 thuan if he's really top of his 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.500
 art it is handy in a course I 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.510
 think that barefoot all four of you 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.110
 help him pass the odds so he should 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.330
 again respond present this is a 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.190
 real metronome for the win 1000 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.510
 it may not be downgraded 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.500
 him standards and will have to actively fight 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.239
 for the first places 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.489
 okay very well just behind you 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.530
 classify the 17 tick Dumont 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.410
 really chases the victories before 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.730
 we talk about it we will listen to what 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.800
 anthony barrier pardon said arnaud 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.820
 the count 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.470
 anthony barrier you go dream and 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.090
 tictacs duly inset from Sunday to 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.510
 vincennes the horse stays on six 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.150
 victories 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.660
 or will he stop no it will stop 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.040
 One day 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.130
 unfortunately we it is true that this 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.200
 is a good puncher has even taken a 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.280
 landing for a few months here it is 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.750
 must work a little less than a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.510
 unlikely to be reported titien 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.400
 task it is not placed at the ceiling of 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.300
 gains he spends a first time on the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.049
 table 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.150
 Here among other urns that will 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.769
 gently complicate the care the cavaille 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.970
 in a short time 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.970
 so be it small is in good shape 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.700
 I think I hope to enter the three 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.950
 first four 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.270
 yes I'll admit that tick dumont 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.430
 two or three months ago I thought a little 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.410
 barred for vincennes but since the red 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.470
 they do not stop saying sorry 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.790
 victories the last time in 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.410
 province he enjoys a good 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.600
 commitment and took full advantage 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.040
 to align a new success he to 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.590
 to stay in the best position 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.200
 as the anthony barrier says it will be at 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.330
 new barefoot him it's a bit the same 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.530
 profile that twenty so he does not have a 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.820
 big big step to win but 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.190
 good for now these limits are 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.260
 further increased on the 2000 this great 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.520
 who this month but it should not be 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.810
 disturbing I think when we know that the 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.050
 jean paul marmion horses are more 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.430
 known for their hardness and ticking him 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.410
 dumont he is really in full 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.320
 possession of his means so me I him 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.510
 again gives broad credit 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.400
 not for the win for the rest I think 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.310
 that for the gain he has not he does not have the 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.080
 class of a universal rider but hey he 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.950
 stays on six wins so hard 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.990
 to say where he will stop 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.030
 that's right and finally fifth you 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.320
 classify useful to somalia that comes from 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.210
 make a very good come back sees the 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.830
 back in the day we ran 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.690
 wise he gives a good jerk for 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.560
 finish but the same is a horse of a 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.350
 class horse 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.910
 it is planned to cover the Gnt at the head and 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.720
 everything with him should benefit mans 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.190
 good engagement in the 2015 tour 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.390
 he may still have missed a little 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.770
 something that's why I did not 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.060
 not passed higher but otherwise I you 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.090
 will admit that cut me off I think would have 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.070
 been composed of the compounds of three 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.200
 7 year old horses between universal rider 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.490
 ultra danish and the one at the top i 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.000
 afraid he still misses a little 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.770
 Something 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.570
 this is the second race what exactly 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.280
 second race after a return but 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.260
 my sebastian garat rate does not have its 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.240
 same to prepare horses for 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.240
 for very good commitments like that 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.290
 so this is somalia water if the loans there 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.940
 can win as well 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.080
 I think he can still miss 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.580
 a little something so I 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.230
 down so after that it's a matter 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.250
 print but hey on his class there 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.470
 holds a first chance 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.610
 okay we'll have understood that was when 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.220
 even simple enough 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.780
 this is it eight or nine horses I 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.360
 not put trinity of the mountains 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.740
 in my prono I took a small risk 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.970
 to be confirmed to vincennes on a little 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.110
 shorter even though she has already done 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.650
 the finish on the course that we 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.110
 interested
