00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
box is some foam and paper we have the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.630 
box is some foam and paper we have the
fits<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> boat

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:09.710 

have<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> wait<00:02:02.000> one<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.630> nothing<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:06.950> grab<00:02:08.720> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
have to wait one is nothing to grab so
