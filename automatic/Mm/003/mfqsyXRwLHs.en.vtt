00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.510
 laval is still in a situation 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.540
 complicated despite the great success 4-1 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.180
 recently against the leader angers laval 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.040
 and 19th and has to make a result at the 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.560
 house against brest 5th 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.300
 the relegated breton league 1 who have 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.270
 makes an interesting league start 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.829
 a single defeat on the first seven 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.210
 days 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.649
 on the Laval side, the one opposite 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.899
 victory for 6 defeats 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.270
 on the first seven matches the 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.219
 drums must therefore attacked in this 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.110
 early game put the pressure on the 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.210
 opposing defense 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.430
 why not on this hit and that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.460
 works the opening of the score from the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.010
 22nd minute for christian bekamenga 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.990
 the former striker fc nantes recovers 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.270
 well the ball turns around the keystroke is 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.070
 powerful enough to deceive the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.350
 vigilance of alexis thebals the guardian of the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.510
 Brest stage fourth goal of the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.790
 season already for bekamenga that were 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.149
 spent in the championship of cfa to 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.470
 carquefou recently laval went on 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.149
 search was right it is effective 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.700
 in this beginning of the season 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.200
 at half-time the tangos did the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.200
 work and leads 1 0 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.310
 it's complicated for brest evolving 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.560
 still without Bernard mendy jonathan 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.080
 ayit the young or alphonse who are 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.570
 injured while Laval side 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.620
 the group is almost complete every 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.000
 Major players are present but brest 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.460
 wakes up in the second half 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.080
 alex dupont raised his voice and his 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.909
 men are finally at the height of the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.610
 match with this center back and the 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.180
 very little academic recovery that 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.070
 works for nicolas verdier 54th 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.370
 minute is the equalization to one everywhere 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:57.650
 second goal of the season for greenfinch 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.650
 an excellent return to the score very fast 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.940
 and Laval residents must start again 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.500
 to take up more in 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.960
 this match why not on these offsets 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.390
 alexis thebals does not catch the ball 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.720
 on the center a balloon picked up by amara 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.560
 baby in the 78th minute first goal of the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.620
 season for baby one of the recruits of the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.450
 Laval stadium this season laval 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.160
 takes advantage of plus 1 in the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.720
 last quarter of an hour 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.350
 a laval team that holds up 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.460
 in front of his public francis the basser 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.680
 second win of the season for 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.980
 laval is the relief for 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 tango
