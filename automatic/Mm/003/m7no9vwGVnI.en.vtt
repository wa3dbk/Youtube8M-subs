00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.710
 we are changing 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.470
 cinema and tv 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.030
 it is necessary to scientist 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.900
 1 remove wheel 2 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.349
 to find 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.380
 where are these bolts not here 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:31.460
 hex is not 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.210
 about here here back here in their 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:45.040
 immediately see here bolts unscrew 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:49.839
 this thing we remove the caliper is called yes 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.550
 we have freed this thing 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.460
 from here they pulled out the old pads 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.309
 here is one of the pads already worn out 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.040
 friendâ€™s tags are less lively 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.680
 we change them because they whistle and won 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.010
 you can see metal on these pads 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.350
 more or less good new even 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.810
 it is clear that it is much thicker 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.970
 now what do you need to make a cylinder 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.799
 gavel or something put 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.180
 the tube and podstuchat 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:26.020
 lead him to that extreme position after 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.370
 of this install new pads and 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.480
 put everything in its place so we moved aside 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.020
 valve drain the bottle bottle to 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.330
 she didn't spill on the floor when we 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.580
 pushed set 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.400
 pads they are very tight because 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.909
 that here there is a small relief here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.479
 I had to come here a little here 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.890
 move a little hammer hard 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.890
 manipulations we have everything in place 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.840
 Now we will fasten all this economy and 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.570
 you will need to be pumped 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.989
 brakes in any case will have to do 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.940
 we are generally changing in this case 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.360
 brake fluid so we her all 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.440
 we will expel here the most important thing 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.209
 the day after that there will be no brakes though 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.780
 would be necessary after all 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.800
 pump all put and do 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.170
 need to be pedal several times 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.990
 pump the brakes so they appear and 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.760
 really check it out on a safe somewhere 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.610
 location and handbrake 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.370
 because cases when even in 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.280
 car services forgotten after replacing 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.209
 Forget about the brakes yet 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.760
 they haven't pumped up their car yet 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.980
 not leaving the car service itself clients 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.310
 were very pleased after that when 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.840
 kopeeshniy repair cost them big 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.250
 body repair money 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.250
 well, that 's basically all 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.860
 and so now pumping the brakes that we 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.390
 for this you need first brake 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:19.370
 fluid is desirable new more precisely well for 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.370
 brake fluid is poured 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.739
 poured over here over here stripes and 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:40.060
 practically did not become because 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:41.250
 pumped the other side add 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.120
 brake fluid 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:50.370
 now it needs to be done together 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.530
 one sits presses the brake pedal 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.530
 I have another one over here 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.840
 machine new very good 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 unscrews twists so i 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.919
 I will make a hand and maybe others 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.989
 cars 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:10.450
 this must be done with a key 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.689
 unscrew the grease cups and talk to a friend 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.689
 which the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.000
 who in the cabin so that he shook 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.400
 pedal 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.909
 down let's squeeze it after this 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.870
 twirl and talk about so he 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.870
 let go the pedal lets go 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.130
 slowly you need to release the pedal 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.770
 sits cabin abruptly throws slowly 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.780
 let go that's when slowly released 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.330
 the pedal is liquid 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.490
 taken out of the tank after that 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:57.000
 open again the greaves and spoke 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:57.000
 swing after this we twist to release 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:07.200
 and so on like that 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.940
 you need to do 10 15 20 generally better 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.460
 total am am clear 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.680
 in order to see the liquid must 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.460
 flow if you change 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.690
 that light whose color you filled 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.440
 should change to light and in the hose 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.530
 there should be no bubbles after 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.630
 you feel that liquid is flowing 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.419
 already it fresh without bubbles 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.840
 you can stop pumping after that 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:40.500
 tighten the grease cup and put everything on 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.740
 place all the brakes pump over in principle 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.740
 everything
