they planning to close achsah jest that

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500 
they planning to close achsah jest that
they<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> plan<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.940> series<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
they have a plan as in some series of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.870 
they have a plan as in some series of
steps<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.989> mind<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:04.680> lead<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
steps in mind that would lead them to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
steps in mind that would lead them to
get<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.450> end<00:01:06.720> result<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> moment

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
get to that end result and at the moment

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
get to that end result and at the moment
it<00:01:08.340> doesn't<00:01:08.549> appear<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.720> any

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it doesn't appear that they have any

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.679 
it doesn't appear that they have any
plan<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.040> fact<00:01:11.310> whenever<00:01:11.939> Congress<00:01:12.330> keeps

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
plan in fact whenever Congress keeps

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.870 
plan in fact whenever Congress keeps
proposing<00:01:13.320> things<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.159> would<00:01:14.310> prevent<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
proposing things that would prevent the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
proposing things that would prevent the
closure<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> Guantanamo<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.020> president

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
closure of Guantanamo the president

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
closure of Guantanamo the president
grumbles<00:01:16.860> about<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.460> signs<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
grumbles about them and signs on the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
grumbles about them and signs on the
dotted<00:01:18.720> line<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> would<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> just

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
dotted line so I would say this is just

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
dotted line so I would say this is just
another<00:01:21.299> indication<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.680> Obama

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
another indication that the Obama

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
another indication that the Obama
administration<00:01:23.610> has<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:24.390> all<00:01:24.479> intents<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
administration has for all intents and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.480 
administration has for all intents and
purposes<00:01:25.320> given<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.950> their<00:01:26.130> efforts<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
purposes given up on their efforts to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
purposes given up on their efforts to
close<00:01:26.759> Guantanamo<00:01:27.420> right<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> mean<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
close Guantanamo right I mean it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
close Guantanamo right I mean it
definitely<00:01:28.439> seems<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.939> what<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
definitely seems like that's what it's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.929 
definitely seems like that's what it's
hinting<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.500> least<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.790> even

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
hinting at at least but you know even

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.319 
hinting at at least but you know even
before<00:01:33.210> news<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.590> office<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.820> working
