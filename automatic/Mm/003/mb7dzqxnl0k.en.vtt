I'll gradually add in my flour so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.010 
I'll gradually add in my flour so
starting<00:00:42.210> off<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.450> flower<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> then

and then all the rest of the flour there

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.260 
and then all the rest of the flour there
just<00:00:57.270> helps<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> keep<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> nice<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.020> light<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
just helps to keep it nice and light and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
just helps to keep it nice and light and
fluffy<00:01:00.270> doesn't<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.989> helps<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> over<00:01:01.710> mix

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
fluffy doesn't it helps not to over mix

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.579 
fluffy doesn't it helps not to over mix
as<00:01:02.160> well<00:01:02.629> what's<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> consistency

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
as well what's that that consistency

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.500 
as well what's that that consistency
there<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> stop<00:01:05.369> using<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.330> ice<00:01:06.479> cream

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.479 
that right to the bottom so I can close
up<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.390> other<00:02:52.510> end<00:02:52.690> by<00:02:52.780> twisting<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.410> got<00:02:54.400> my

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
up the other end by twisting it I got my

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.910 
up the other end by twisting it I got my
cupcake<00:02:54.910> here<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.540> as<00:02:56.079> you<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.320> see<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.769> red

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
cupcake here and as you can see that red

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.250 
cupcake here and as you can see that red
frosting<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.700> coming<00:02:58.299> out<00:02:58.390> just<00:02:58.630> at<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.049> edge

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
frosting is coming out just at the edge

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.750 
frosting is coming out just at the edge
because<00:02:59.560> we<00:02:59.680> made<00:02:59.890> sure<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.250> line<00:03:00.370> up<00:03:00.549> with<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
because we made sure to line up with the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.640 
because we made sure to line up with the
thinner<00:03:01.000> side<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.540> because<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.260> didn't<00:03:02.470> put

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
thinner side and because we didn't put

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.050 
thinner side and because we didn't put
as<00:03:02.739> much<00:03:02.950> red<00:03:03.190> frosting<00:03:03.430> as<00:03:03.670> we<00:03:03.790> did<00:03:03.940> the

as much red frosting as we did the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.000 
as much red frosting as we did the

out<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.430> very<00:03:06.609> thin<00:03:07.510> streak<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.940> was

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
out in a very thin streak so that was

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.170 
out in a very thin streak so that was
the<00:03:10.120> point<00:03:10.269> of<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.920> then<00:03:11.920> zigzag<00:03:12.250> motions<00:03:12.970> up

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
the point of that then zigzag motions up

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.819 
the point of that then zigzag motions up
and<00:03:13.359> down<00:03:13.480> zigzag<00:03:13.900> sort<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.200> motions<00:03:14.560> we'll

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
and down zigzag sort of motions we'll

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.180 
and down zigzag sort of motions we'll
start<00:03:15.070> creating<00:03:15.340> our<00:03:15.670> buttercream<00:03:16.120> ruffle
