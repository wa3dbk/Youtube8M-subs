it<00:02:34.270> even<00:02:34.510> has<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.720> cheesy<00:02:35.260> music<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.660> can

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
it even has the cheesy music and you can

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.199 
it even has the cheesy music and you can

and alligators and turtles with it after

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.530 
and alligators and turtles with it after
playing<00:03:02.920> Frogger<00:03:03.220> recently<00:03:03.849> I've<00:03:04.090> come<00:03:04.120> up

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
playing Frogger recently I've come up

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.100 
playing Frogger recently I've come up
with<00:03:04.780> several<00:03:05.080> other<00:03:05.440> issues<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.000> game

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
with several other issues with this game

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.220 
with several other issues with this game
that<00:03:08.110> make<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.560> less<00:03:08.799> realistic<00:03:09.870> first<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.049> all

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
that make it less realistic first of all

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.580 
that make it less realistic first of all
let's<00:03:11.530> look<00:03:11.620> at<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.920> size<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.760> Frogger<00:03:13.590> that's

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
let's look at the size of Frogger that's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.979 
let's look at the size of Frogger that's
the<00:03:14.829> biggest<00:03:15.099> frog<00:03:15.640> I've<00:03:15.910> ever<00:03:16.180> seen<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
the biggest frog I've ever seen it's the

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.339 
the biggest frog I've ever seen it's the
size<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.709> car<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.640> what's<00:03:19.420> truly<00:03:19.870> amazing

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
size of a car and what's truly amazing

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.339 
size of a car and what's truly amazing
about<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:20.829> game<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.510> yes<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.720> suspends

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
about this game is that yes it suspends

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.630 
about this game is that yes it suspends
disbelief<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.130> you're<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.400> really

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
disbelief and you're not really

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.729 
disbelief and you're not really
concerned<00:03:25.120> about<00:03:25.480> why<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.049> Frog<00:03:26.319> trying

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
concerned about why is the Frog trying

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.670 
concerned about why is the Frog trying
to<00:03:26.890> cross<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.400> road<00:03:27.579> in<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.060> river<00:03:28.269> but<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
to cross the road in the river but the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.580 
to cross the road in the river but the
programmers<00:03:30.489> completely<00:03:31.299> failed<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:32.170> realize

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
programmers completely failed to realize

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.089 
programmers completely failed to realize
that<00:03:32.980> if<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.489> frog<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.420> size<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.989> an<00:03:35.110> SUV<00:03:35.560> hopped

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
that if a frog the size of an SUV hopped

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.940 
that if a frog the size of an SUV hopped
in<00:03:36.310> front<00:03:36.579> of<00:03:36.670> your<00:03:36.849> car<00:03:37.180> you'd<00:03:37.989> probably<00:03:38.560> slam

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
in front of your car you'd probably slam

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.190 
in front of your car you'd probably slam
on<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.310> brakes<00:03:39.609> or<00:03:40.030> at<00:03:40.150> least<00:03:40.359> swerve<00:03:40.930> out<00:03:41.139> of

what highway is this screwed up where

make a single - Frogger since he's
obviously<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:11.220> mutated<00:05:11.880> frog<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.720> would<00:05:12.990> give

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
obviously a mutated frog I would give

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.469 
obviously a mutated frog I would give
him<00:05:13.320> fire<00:05:13.710> breathing<00:05:14.070> capabilities<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.449> that

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
him fire breathing capabilities so that

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.510 
him fire breathing capabilities so that
he<00:05:15.750> could<00:05:15.960> then<00:05:16.110> clear<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.500> path<00:05:16.830> through<00:05:17.160> the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
he could then clear a path through the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.330 
he could then clear a path through the
traffic<00:05:17.789> and<00:05:18.320> then<00:05:19.320> turn<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.800> river<00:05:19.979> into

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
traffic and then turn the river into

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:36.600 
traffic and then turn the river into
blood<00:05:21.030> sprout<00:05:21.780> wings<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.320> fly<00:05:22.620> off

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.669
