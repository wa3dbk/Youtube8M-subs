00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
might incorporate some different types

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.469 
might incorporate some different types
of<00:02:03.390> fats<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:04.680> find<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.240> kind

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
of fats I find that you know it's kind

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.270 
of fats I find that you know it's kind
of<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.780> little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> Mediterranean

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
of a little bit like a Mediterranean

of a little bit like a Mediterranean
type<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.670> dish<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.149> works<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:09.929> well<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
type of dish and works really well and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.120 
type of dish and works really well and
then<00:02:10.860> from<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.700> three

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
then from here we just have three

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.740 
then from here we just have three
simple<00:02:12.370> things<00:02:12.400> we<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:12.940> some<00:02:13.150> olive<00:02:13.570> oil

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
simple things we have some olive oil
