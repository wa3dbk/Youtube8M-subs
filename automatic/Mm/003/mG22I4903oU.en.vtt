00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.560 
when I find a new use for something
that's<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.259> actually<00:01:55.619> completely<00:01:56.159> shitty

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
that's all I actually completely shitty

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.700 
that's all I actually completely shitty
would<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.689> locked<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> bullets<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.560> too

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
would have locked the bullets there too

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.819 
would have locked the bullets there too
if<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.219> fired<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.180> me<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.509> course<00:02:01.020> those<00:02:01.560> guys

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
if they fired at me of course those guys

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.130 
if they fired at me of course those guys
don't<00:02:02.040> actually<00:02:02.610> aim<00:02:02.969> at<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.600> they're<00:02:04.110> just

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
don't actually aim at you they're just

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
don't actually aim at you they're just
placed<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> way<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.850> most

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
placed in the way that you are most

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.899 
placed in the way that you are most
likely<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> run<00:02:06.780> into<00:02:06.810> them

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
likely to run into them

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.699 
likely to run into them
so<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.629> part<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.080> level<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.560> one

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
so this part of the level is the one

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.050 
so this part of the level is the one
that's<00:02:09.830> probably<00:02:10.220> going<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.519> kill<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
that's probably going to kill you the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.940 
that's probably going to kill you the
most<00:02:11.300> because<00:02:11.629> of<00:02:12.140> spikes<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.830> low

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
most because of spikes and the low

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.030 
most because of spikes and the low
gravity<00:02:13.129> it<00:02:13.879> is<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> very<00:02:14.330> standard<00:02:15.040> underwater

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
gravity it is a very standard underwater

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.970 
gravity it is a very standard underwater
section<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.090> big<00:02:17.390> air<00:02:17.569> quotes<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.709> plays

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
section in big air quotes it plays

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.009 
section in big air quotes it plays
exactly<00:02:19.190> like<00:02:19.730> battlements<00:02:20.330> level<00:02:20.599> both<00:02:20.780> ends

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
exactly like battlements level both ends

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.680 
exactly like battlements level both ends
nothing<00:02:21.590> new<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.970> looks<00:02:23.150> differently

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
nothing new but it looks differently

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.539 
nothing new but it looks differently
this<00:02:24.019> theme<00:02:24.379> differently<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.129> that's<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.430> good

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
this theme differently and that's a good

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.809 
this theme differently and that's a good
thing<00:02:26.799> following<00:02:27.799> up<00:02:27.890> are<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.310> missiles<00:02:28.640> and

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
thing following up are the missiles and

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.360 
thing following up are the missiles and
you<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:29.239> see<00:02:29.569> here<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.290> somewhat<00:02:30.890> clearly

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
you can see here is somewhat clearly

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.000 
you can see here is somewhat clearly
that<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.030> debris<00:02:32.209> does<00:02:32.750> target<00:02:33.349> Megaman

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
that the debris does target Megaman

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.460 
that the debris does target Megaman
homing<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.599> probably<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
homing in on it is probably not the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.339 
homing in on it is probably not the
right<00:02:36.590> word<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:38.120> middle<00:02:38.450> part<00:02:38.690> as<00:02:39.019> I<00:02:39.080> was

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
right word the middle part as I was

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.380 
right word the middle part as I was
