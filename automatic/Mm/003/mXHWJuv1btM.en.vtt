is<00:00:24.390> similar<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.960> dish<00:00:25.609> soldiers<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.789> eggs

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is similar to the dish soldiers and eggs

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.970 
is similar to the dish soldiers and eggs
it's<00:00:27.420> these<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:27.779> stick<00:00:28.199> figure<00:00:28.529> eanes

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
it's these little stick figure eanes

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's these little stick figure eanes
of<00:00:29.720> toasted<00:00:30.720> bread<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.800> soft-boiled<00:00:32.489> egg

so<00:01:50.759> once<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> add<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.179> egg<00:01:51.479> yolk<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:51.989 
so once you add your egg yolk to the

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:53.779 
so once you add your egg yolk to the
slightly<00:01:52.289> warm<00:01:52.709> Bernays<00:01:53.130> reduction<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
slightly warm Bernays reduction just

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.270 
slightly warm Bernays reduction just
slowly<00:01:54.329> add<00:01:54.780> your<00:01:55.229> butter<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.829> cube<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.220> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
slowly add your butter one cube at a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.699 
slowly add your butter one cube at a
time<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.390> ensures<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.289> mixture

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
time and this ensures that the mixture

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.580 
time and this ensures that the mixture
won't<00:01:59.039> split<00:01:59.459> or<00:01:59.610> break<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.149> mix<00:02:00.599> it<00:02:03.590> so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
won't split or break as you mix it so
