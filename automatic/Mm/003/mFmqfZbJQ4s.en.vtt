00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.430
 congratulations on the first goal after 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.919
 returning vanguard 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.500
 how do you rate the match as far as all the same 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.000
 it was evident that something is affecting our 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.390
 playing our hard training thanks 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.390
 governing body 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.130
 so far we have some confusion 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.439
 present but i think it is 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.989
 from loads under loads all the same 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.590
 We have a very hard work goes well at 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.050
 the game 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.660
 I personally think that we played very 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.409
 well created many moments just 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.890
 somewhere out of luck turn did not get you 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.290
 I must pay tribute almost home well 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.680
 looked 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.920
 character showed leveled in 5 minutes 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.200
 in the third period the score is somehow in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 dressing room discussed were set up as 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.050
 then we will see another device all well yes 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 of course we talked to the coach 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.190
 talk to you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.190
 corrected something came out charged 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.920
 3 because 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.480
 did not want to lose the dry 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.230
 here 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.630
 here it happened when after 22 all the same 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.390
 that's why you couldn't finish the word 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.610
 say one thing just the Czechs when 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.610
 you were charged to your fans 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.890
 I think it affected all the same for 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.870
 You are here for our team 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.180
 the main lessons from this game are because 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.950
 after all this is preseason and doing 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.970
 global conclusions hardly worth yes a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.970
 just need to highlight some lessons 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 lesson 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 probably 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.490
 pay attention to the little things 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.180
 play every moment to the end 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.100
 but honestly 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.100
 played once again great just 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.650
 Well, that is, two goals are not 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.560
 No one's downtrodden I apologize of course 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.440
 random goals 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.830
 the first 2 1 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.319
 2 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.450
 we didnâ€™t give up 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.770
 workflow is years summer hockey 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.459
 everything is normal 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.780
 what do you think Chelyabinsk tournament 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.980
 for sure the same load will save and yes 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.460
 somehow the team will look different 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.210
 yes, I think 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.940
 two days off, we will give them 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.250
 Chelyabinsk forces will help us with us 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.250
 will you see the same
