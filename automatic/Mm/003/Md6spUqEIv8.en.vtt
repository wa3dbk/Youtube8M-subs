00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.520 
ass and that's just funny because people
predict<00:03:43.819> i<00:03:43.970> have<00:03:44.180> resistance<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.110> ice<00:03:45.230> and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
predict i have resistance to ice and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.920 
predict i have resistance to ice and
fire<00:03:45.739> but<00:03:46.069> i<00:03:46.160> actually<00:03:46.340> have<00:03:46.700> guts<00:03:47.000> just

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
because the left or higher on gamma

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.250 
because the left or higher on gamma
using<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.090> last<00:03:50.269> people<00:03:50.600> think<00:03:50.840> i<00:03:50.959> have<00:03:51.140> the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.070 

all<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.980> mightiness<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.850> ariana's<00:04:42.540> was<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
all the mightiness of ariana's was the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.200 
all the mightiness of ariana's was the
Alcazar<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.010> i'll<00:04:44.160> go<00:04:44.280> for<00:04:44.400> revenge<00:04:44.880> i<00:04:45.060> know<00:04:45.120> i

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
Alcazar and i'll go for revenge i know i

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.540

can<00:04:45.300> take<00:04:45.780> down<00:04:45.990> even<00:04:46.440> after<00:04:46.590> not<00:04:47.010> being<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.340> kid

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
can take down even after not being a kid

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.150
