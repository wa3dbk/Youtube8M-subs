 methods that a comedian uses to 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.850
 making people laugh 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.810

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.460
 a number one 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.360
 play on self-deprecating she ridiculous 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.860
 self-mockery 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.890
 it's the act of laughing about oneself 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.170
 the opposite is pretentious agen group 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:32.590
 and as for the ridiculous I'm going 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:35.080
 not do you a ridiculous drawing does not kill 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.070
 not and what does not kill us makes us more 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.290
 strong 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.360
 ridicule makes us stronger but 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.000
 to both inputs you to imitations 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.860
 with an eye observers honed you 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.580
 will be able to pass you for any 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.670

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.270
 when I ask kids 15 years 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.000
 but where does the beef come from and where does it come from 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.480
 answer from the mcdo but it's appalling 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.940
 Sprains to stop the cigarette in morgane 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.709
 is my life so of course you can 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.620
 always imitate the baker or the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.209
 hairdresser in the corner but that must be the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.070
 no one in the face know him when 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.830
 even too cool at home I am 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.140

 third method of a comedian he plays 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.470
 with the words what is called games 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.140
 to boer do this kind of humor is very 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.570
 difficult to know when to tell 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.130
 who to say it and why it is said otherwise 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.010
 it can become very very flat like 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.230
 humor alone the 10% of internet is 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 ask who can play 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:52.819
 ok here we are going to call then alain 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:58.049

 unknown 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.840
 and yeah to you to judge 4th the irony is 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.580
 the parody the parody it's simple it's 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.709
 to make fun of you denounce some 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.700
 atrocious thing depending on whatever 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.140
 something that is already existing that makes 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.420
 live with you 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.440
 the irony is the saying of the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.680
 contrary to what we think 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.590

 so when I talk about black humor I 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.579
 not talking about cortex humor at all 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.209

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.700
 sensitive 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.739
 tabbou that disturbs that nobody dares 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.950
 to say everything round and that all think everything 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.760
 low 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.220
 it can touch the origins the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.959
 religious the sick black humor has 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.880
 been created to denounce the values 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.040
 negative morals of some people 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.260
 we do not necessarily think was based on 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.720
 stereotypes but very few 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.250
 people then understand there hello
