 outwardly he is no different from 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.579
 the laptop that we looked at 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.430
 first review 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.739
 the thing is that in 2008 the company 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.680
 by kbr acquired by acer that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.629
 reflected on the design of the laptop 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.640
 see for yourself the differences 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.039
 only in the logo which is located on

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.799

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.810
 in a laptop 4 gigabytes of operational 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.330
 memory with the possibility of increasing to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.729
 we tested ati nvidia video card 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.590
 in 3d mark 06 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.840
 which gave us eight thousand four hundred 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
