00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
little bit high off the ground as you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.639 
little bit high off the ground as you
can<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> had<00:02:03.780> no<00:02:03.930> problem<00:02:04.259> fitting<00:02:04.350> three

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
can see I had no problem fitting three

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.530 
can see I had no problem fitting three
child<00:02:04.920> seats<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> back<00:02:05.700> one<00:02:06.270> thing<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
child seats in the back one thing to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.940 
child seats in the back one thing to
note<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.869> these<00:02:07.140> seats<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.619> seem<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
note is that these seats do seem a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.559 
note is that these seats do seem a
little<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.250> skewed<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.789> passenger<00:02:09.390> side

little bit skewed to the passenger side

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.880 
little bit skewed to the passenger side
so<00:02:09.629> there's<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.020> quite<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.410> clearance

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so there's not quite as much clearance

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.110
