00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello that such friends today we are going to 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.510
 present a free open type cabinet 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.690
 like this one that we see here is designed 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 for professional cameras how are they 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.349
 These cameras are not designed to 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.900
 exteriors that's why it should be 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.279
 use cabinets like this guy those 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.260
 cabinets provide the camera 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.449
 protection against the sun against water 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.680
 against dust even protect it from 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.189
 that someone can remove it from their 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.100
 position or you can manipulate these 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.350
 cabinets have a package that 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.990
 prevents water from entering as well as 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.450
 powder have a hole to be able 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.100
 put the cables already brings the connector and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.410
 the screw included 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.090
 or can you with a connector 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.769
 liquefied three-quarters to be able 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.750
 place to install what constituted 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.230
 flexible and the cables are completely 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.290
 protected with a rail the rail 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.820
 which is to place the camera on this one 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.030
 with the screw that comes included 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.860
 and assemble it here this comes in pressure and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.380
 you can slide the camera towards 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.220
 the point that suits you best 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.220
 depending on your application 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.890
 It also has an entrance for the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.440
 padlock so that the camera is 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.950
 totally closed and nobody can access 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.950
 to the camera 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.680
 the crystal is completely transparent 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.719
 has arm support for 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.970
 that you can place an arm 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.289
 straight or a hook type arm depending 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.390
 of the application that you are going to 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.329
 give your camera and the position where 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 is going to be these cabinets only 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.800
 they are recommended for cameras 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.080
 professionals 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.720
 It is not recommended for wing type cameras 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.560
 like these because because these chambers 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.480
 bullet type 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.870
 emit infrared light then at 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.700
 moment that you place it inside 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.100
 apart from that there is no way to fix the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.880
 in because these cameras do not have 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.680
 to set 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.380
 infrared light is reflected in the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.759
 crystal what prevents the camera from seeing 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.530
 at night 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.000
 at the moment the infrared is reflected 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.830
 in the glass you will not be able to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.470
 distinguish anything since the camera is going to 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.870
 dazzle 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.010
 then only recommended for 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.010
 professional cameras 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.099
 we also have cabinets and 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.560
 infrared that in the opposite 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.090
 they have illuminators so that you 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.310
 professional cameras that do not have 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.069
 night vision in total darkness what 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.110
 can do for the moment is all 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.690
 I hope this explanation has served you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.090
 of the cabinets and we invite you to
