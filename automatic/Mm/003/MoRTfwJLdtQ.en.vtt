00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the moc are you dropping it kills something 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.089
 that is, I think everyone knows it 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.220
 is also possible this drop just like that 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.380
 exhibit and how that among other things 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.059
 from the pug but also for entities or for 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.130
 normal blocks is the experience you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.420
 in this tutorial of whom 107 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.310
 but let's just take it 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.350
 zombie and can do this just once 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.880
 and already drop us in this case 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.560
 But we want to rot flesh 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.930
 no more flesh flesh in this case 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 gunpowder from the war then get enough 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.050
 it with a simple game probably 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.990
 work and that is that they are in this 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.890
 the game is probably dumont blood and that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 Let's do it for the game of dumont blood 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.430
 in this case we just have to go with it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.100
 push through tap and then behind it 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 if then the whole thing is disabled and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.550
 if we kill the war now 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.960
 He should be paradoxical to us 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.640
 that did not in this case we 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.940
 Do not get any money or what is there 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.710
 Come on 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.170
 we just got on with the game boy 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 worked and thus drop us nothing 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 But we do not just get jobs 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.140
 from mobs like just but also from whole 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.640
 normal stone and we build this zb 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 Let's start with this case 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.829
 stone in it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.539
 then we get a second stone 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.250
 dropped to it but that does not have to be 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.250
 if we do not want that and that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.310
 we give for it / game how exactly 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 also and then part 1 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.869
 and then we will not notice if 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.610
 you part drops on if and already have 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.799
 we also disabled this dropping 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 if we break something down then you can do it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.340
 the stone was lost but we got it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 not in our inventory actually quite 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 easy and now we'll go further 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.890
 in the minecraft version 1.1 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.570
 because with this was a new game 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.009
 inserted ball which makes it possible for us 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.110
 also for entities the drobs too 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.479
 enable or disable more 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 So now we are here 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.229
 in the minecraft version 1.8 mainz 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.750
 By the way, its changes here too 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.670
 learn and now it goes on with the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.979
 next game well and that is the duo 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.450
 entity drop but before we test it 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.369
 Just look if we're in here now 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 In this case, the ibm frames the entities 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.460
 are pressed to get the torch 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 we get already and also the item 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.670
 frame pops out in the high arch 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.369
 and we will do it all now 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.259
 prevent and with game well and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.180
 then in this case , the drops finished 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.009
 and the whole thing just has to go on now 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.270
 be presented and already beat 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.950
 Let's go back and then 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.550
 the item disappears and we get 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.410
 no entities mcgraw 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.970
 you can find practically the three games you like 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.650
 of course in the video description 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.960
 and in the video description you will find 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.820
 again the link to the minecraft 1.8 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.160
 point 1 update video or you are looking 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.750
 just below the tutorial on how 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.790
 her the writing in the relaxed table 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.200
 he could translate that too very much 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.790
 handy and then thank you for 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.790
 watch trees and until then
