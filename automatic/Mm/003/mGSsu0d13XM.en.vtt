00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
and we're gonna desaturate it so color

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.540 
and we're gonna desaturate it so color
correction<00:03:11.350> hue<00:03:12.350> saturation<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:15.280> all<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.310> need

important<00:04:03.710> color<00:04:04.460> correction<00:04:04.910> tools<00:04:05.120> that

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
important color correction tools that

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.070 
important color correction tools that
you'll<00:04:05.480> use<00:04:06.040> I'm<00:04:07.040> gonna<00:04:07.220> move<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:08.480> over<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.050> I

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
you'll use I'm gonna move this over so I

can see what I'm looking at because the
histogram<00:04:11.420> here<00:04:12.380> was<00:04:12.710> covered<00:04:13.700> up<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.000> what

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
histogram here was covered up and what

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.170 
histogram here was covered up and what
I'm<00:04:14.990> gonna<00:04:15.110> do<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.680> move<00:04:16.010> this<00:04:16.280> white<00:04:16.910> arrow

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.300 
I'm gonna do is move this white arrow
right<00:04:17.570> here<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.380> it's<00:04:18.530> going<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.739> affect<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
right here and it's going to affect the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.950 
right here and it's going to affect the

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
output white and I'm just gonna make it

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.330 
output white and I'm just gonna make it

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.129 

maybe<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.460> lot<00:04:28.670> darker

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.260 
maybe yeah around 70 75 seems good now
that's<00:04:44.080> pretty<00:04:44.289> dark<00:04:44.620> there<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.129> that's<00:04:46.060> good

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
that's pretty dark there and that's good

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.589 
that's pretty dark there and that's good
for<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.870> color<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.169> our<00:04:47.560> background<00:04:48.599> I'll

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
for the color of our background I'll

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.629 
for the color of our background I'll
twirl<00:04:49.960> these<00:04:50.139> up<00:04:50.319> so<00:04:50.500> they're<00:04:51.009> not<00:04:51.129> all<00:04:51.310> over

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
twirl these up so they're not all over

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.920 
twirl these up so they're not all over
the<00:04:51.729> place<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.770> next<00:04:54.129> thing<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:54.370> we<00:04:54.939> should

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
the place the next thing that we should

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.679 
the place the next thing that we should
make<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.469> a<00:04:56.800> vignette<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:57.969> edges<00:04:58.150> of

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
make is a vignette so that the edges of

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.899 
make is a vignette so that the edges of
the<00:04:59.400> background<00:05:00.400> are<00:05:01.199> like<00:05:02.219> darkened<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.580> it

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
the background are like darkened and it

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.270 
the background are like darkened and it
looks<00:05:04.120> more<00:05:04.389> like<00:05:05.199> creepy<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.800> way<00:05:08.830> that

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
looks more like creepy the way that

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.800 
looks more like creepy the way that

circle that's the size of the comp I'm
going<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.370> invert<00:05:42.759> that<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:44.229> it's<00:05:44.560> only<00:05:44.770> on<00:05:45.099> the

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
going to invert that so it's only on the

going to invert that so it's only on the
edges<00:05:45.870> I'm<00:05:46.870> gonna<00:05:47.020> turn<00:05:47.560> off<00:05:47.740> my<00:05:47.949> mask<00:05:48.190> there

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:52.089 
and I'm going to kotor down into my mass

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.260

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
properties and head over to mask feather

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.600 
properties and head over to mask feather
and<00:05:55.629> then<00:05:56.319> we're<00:05:56.409> gonna<00:05:56.500> feather<00:05:56.860> this<00:05:57.069> out

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.720 

it's<00:06:00.610> gonna<00:06:00.849> darken<00:06:01.180> it<00:06:01.419> also<00:06:01.599> so

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730

spotlight kind of on in the middle so
I'm<00:06:20.930> gonna<00:06:21.110> split<00:06:21.620> these<00:06:22.010> tutorials<00:06:22.790> into

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
I'm gonna split these tutorials into

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.400 
I'm gonna split these tutorials into
sections<00:06:24.650> because<00:06:25.600> the<00:06:26.600> last<00:06:26.810> time<00:06:27.110> I<00:06:27.140> made

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
sections because the last time I made

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.460 
sections because the last time I made
this<00:06:27.590> tutorial<00:06:27.800> I<00:06:28.490> spent<00:06:29.300> hour<00:06:29.510> making<00:06:29.870> it<00:06:30.170> and

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
this tutorial I spent hour making it and

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.690 
this tutorial I spent hour making it and
then<00:06:30.710> the<00:06:31.870> recorder<00:06:32.870> screwed<00:06:33.590> up<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:34.010> I<00:06:34.610> was

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
then the recorder screwed up and I was

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.540 
then the recorder screwed up and I was
really<00:06:35.030> really<00:06:35.150> mad<00:06:35.620> so<00:06:36.620> my<00:06:37.040> mouse<00:06:37.250> didn't

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
really really mad so my mouse didn't

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.220 
really really mad so my mouse didn't
even<00:06:37.670> move<00:06:37.970> across<00:06:38.210> the<00:06:38.450> screen<00:06:38.660> I<00:06:38.780> figured

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
even move across the screen I figured

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.270 
even move across the screen I figured
you<00:06:39.290> guys<00:06:39.350> wouldn't<00:06:39.680> like<00:06:39.830> that<00:06:39.980> so<00:06:40.190> I'm

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
you guys wouldn't like that so I'm

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.950 
you guys wouldn't like that so I'm
redoing<00:06:40.580> it<00:06:40.820> so<00:06:41.560> we're<00:06:42.560> going<00:06:42.710> to<00:06:43.070> end<00:06:44.000> this

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
redoing it so we're going to end this

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.050 
redoing it so we're going to end this
part<00:06:45.230> of<00:06:45.320> the<00:06:45.380> tutorial<00:06:45.560> and<00:06:46.220> then<00:06:46.460> I'll<00:06:46.790> see

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
part of the tutorial and then I'll see

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.990 
part of the tutorial and then I'll see
you<00:06:47.090> on<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.510> next<00:06:47.720> part
