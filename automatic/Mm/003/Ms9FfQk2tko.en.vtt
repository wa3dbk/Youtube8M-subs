about<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> bikes<00:00:17.029> that<00:00:18.029> was<00:00:18.150> our

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
about one of the bikes that was our

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.599 
about one of the bikes that was our
last-minute<00:00:18.990> completion<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.400> year's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
last-minute completion for this year's

NAB<00:00:20.869> this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> full<00:00:22.560> titanium<00:00:23.449> coupled<00:00:24.449> bike

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
NAB this is a full titanium coupled bike

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
NAB this is a full titanium coupled bike
which<00:00:25.529> allows<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> break<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.490> half<00:00:26.670> for

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
which allows it to break in half for

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.240 
which allows it to break in half for
travel<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.680> airlines<00:00:28.680> without<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.099> additional

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
fee so pretty cool you get to stick it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.170 
fee so pretty cool you get to stick it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.970 
unique features features a 44 ID head
tube<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.020> stronger<00:00:43.469> tapered

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980

brackets that re bebés kind of a bum
wrap<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:58.079> say<00:00:58.230> oh<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.500> creak<00:00:58.829> oh

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
wrap because they say oh they creak oh

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.220 
wrap because they say oh they creak oh
they<00:00:59.730> move<00:00:59.969> oh<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.390> hold<00:01:00.600> tight<00:01:00.809> well

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
they move oh they don't hold tight well

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.450 
they move oh they don't hold tight well
the<00:01:01.320> reason<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.100> because<00:01:02.250> they

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the reason for that is is because they

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.549 
the reason for that is is because they
don't<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.670> precise<00:01:03.480> machining<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.409> don't

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
don't have precise machining they don't

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
don't have precise machining they don't
have<00:01:04.680> enough<00:01:04.920> surface<00:01:05.220> area<00:01:05.489> contact<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.479> we

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
have enough surface area contact so we

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.969 
have enough surface area contact so we
do<00:01:06.689> everything<00:01:07.140> in-house<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.650> make<00:01:07.770> sure<00:01:07.890> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
do everything in-house to make sure that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
do everything in-house to make sure that
we<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> perfectly<00:01:08.700> mated<00:01:09.060> surface<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we have a perfectly mated surface and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.010 
we have a perfectly mated surface and
it's<00:01:10.350> easily<00:01:10.740> adjusted<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> trail<00:01:12.020> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it's easily adjusted on the trail this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.460 
it's easily adjusted on the trail this
bike<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.189> titanium<00:01:14.939> yolk<00:01:15.470> from

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
bike also has a titanium yolk from

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.370 
bike also has a titanium yolk from
Paragon<00:01:17.250> machine<00:01:17.549> works<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:18.780> use<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.259> two

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
Paragon machine works we use it for two

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260 
Paragon machine works we use it for two
reasons<00:01:19.770> number<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.030> gives<00:01:21.090> us

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
reasons number one because it gives us

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.240 
reasons number one because it gives us
the<00:01:21.330> stiffness<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.110> necessary<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.100> make

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the stiffness that's necessary to make

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
the stiffness that's necessary to make
sure<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.430> our<00:01:23.790> belt<00:01:24.090> drive<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:25.229> through

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
sure that our belt drive right through

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.160 
sure that our belt drive right through
here<00:01:25.710> maintains<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.670> perfect<00:01:27.119> inline<00:01:27.600> position

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
here maintains a perfect inline position

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.469 
here maintains a perfect inline position
from<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> front<00:01:29.100> chainring<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> way

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
from the front chainring all the way

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
from the front chainring all the way
back<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> belt<00:01:31.140> cog<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:31.950> have

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
back to the belt cog so we don't have

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.850 
back to the belt cog so we don't have
any<00:01:32.220> belt<00:01:32.430> travel<00:01:32.880> number<00:01:33.750> two<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.530> gives<00:01:34.680> us

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
any belt travel number two it gives us

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
any belt travel number two it gives us
plenty<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.340> room<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.939> larger<00:01:36.329> tire<00:01:36.570> should

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
plenty of room for a larger tire should

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.359 
plenty of room for a larger tire should
the<00:01:37.049> customer<00:01:37.470> desire<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:37.979> thirdly

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
the customer desire it and thirdly

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.340 
the customer desire it and thirdly
utilizing<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.090> gives<00:01:42.509> us<00:01:42.659> room<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
utilizing this it gives us room in the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.910 
utilizing this it gives us room in the
chainstay

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
chainstay

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
chainstay
so<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> cutout<00:01:45.360> or

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so we don't have to do a cutout or

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
so we don't have to do a cutout or
excessive<00:01:46.680> swaging

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
excessive swaging

became<00:04:44.250> hard<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.729> replace<00:04:44.969> so<00:04:45.719> he<00:04:45.840> dropped<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
became hard to replace so he dropped the

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.649 
became hard to replace so he dropped the
design<00:04:46.500> when<00:04:47.159> Shimano<00:04:47.520> came<00:04:47.819> back<00:04:48.030> out<00:04:48.300> with

design when Shimano came back out with
the<00:04:49.319> outboard<00:04:49.860> bearings<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.610> saw<00:04:51.300> an

the outboard bearings I saw an

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.029 
the outboard bearings I saw an
opportunity<00:04:51.539> to<00:04:52.020> redesign<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.590> crank<00:04:52.830> and

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
opportunity to redesign the crank and

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.730 
opportunity to redesign the crank and
