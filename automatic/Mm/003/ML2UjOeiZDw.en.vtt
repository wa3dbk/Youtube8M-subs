learned about pressure and forces and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
learned about pressure and forces and
things<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.720> physics<00:01:18.870> and<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.860> needed<00:01:20.190> that<00:01:20.370> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
things in physics and I needed that in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.250 
things in physics and I needed that in
order<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.210> understand<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.170> was

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
order to actually understand what was

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.930 
order to actually understand what was
really<00:01:22.440> going<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.770> behind<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.430> construction

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
really going on behind the construction

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.789 
really going on behind the construction
of<00:01:24.270> these<00:01:24.360> air<00:01:24.540> cannons<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.710> know

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
of these air cannons and you know

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.020 
of these air cannons and you know
building<00:01:26.130> valves<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.640> everything<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:26.940> that

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
building valves and everything like that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
building valves and everything like that
so<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> realized<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.280> learned

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
so I realized you know that I learned

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.219 
so I realized you know that I learned
all<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:29.940> stuff<00:01:30.149> at<00:01:30.270> school<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.899> actually

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
all this stuff at school I can actually

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.570 
all this stuff at school I can actually
apply<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.469> to<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.920> project

sure<00:02:12.550> all<00:02:12.790> right<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.830> innovation<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
sure all right the innovation is the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.990 
sure all right the innovation is the
creative<00:02:19.270> use<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.570> gyroscopes<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:21.310> spherical

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
creative use of gyroscopes the spherical

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.370 
creative use of gyroscopes the spherical
robot<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.420> built<00:02:22.450> incorporates

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
robot that I built incorporates

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.350 
robot that I built incorporates
gyroscopes<00:02:24.100> gravity<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:24.970> going<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.240> be

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
gyroscopes gravity is going to be

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.490 
gyroscopes gravity is going to be
pulling<00:02:25.570> down<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.900> gyroscope<00:02:26.290> which<00:02:26.410> is

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
pulling down the gyroscope which is

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.470 
pulling down the gyroscope which is
going<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.830> try<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.070> tilt<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.670> spin<00:02:27.940> axis<00:02:28.120> this

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
going to try to tilt the spin axis this

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840 
going to try to tilt the spin axis this
way<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:28.930> gonna<00:02:29.050> apply<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.410> torque<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.610> tilt

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
way it's gonna apply it torque to tilt

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.170 
way it's gonna apply it torque to tilt
the<00:02:30.910> spin<00:02:31.120> axis<00:02:31.270> this<00:02:31.540> way<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.590> will<00:02:32.680> react

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the spin axis this way and it will react

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.600 
the spin axis this way and it will react
by<00:02:34.180> moving<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.230> way<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.890> reacts<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.520> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
by moving this way so it reacts in the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.040 
by moving this way so it reacts in the
third<00:02:36.820> direction<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.959> actually

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
third direction and so it actually

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.540 
third direction and so it actually
rotate<00:02:38.590> around<00:02:38.709> if<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.550> let<00:02:39.730> go<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.890> processes

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
rotate around if I let go it processes

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.759 
rotate around if I let go it processes
around<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.780> circle<00:02:43.989> instead<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.410> falling

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
around in a circle instead of falling

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.530 
around in a circle instead of falling
straight<00:02:44.950> down<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.310> table<00:02:45.459> whereas<00:02:46.390> if

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
straight down to the table whereas if

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.229 
straight down to the table whereas if
this<00:02:46.660> we're<00:02:46.870> not<00:02:46.959> spinning<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.380> all<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.090> did

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
this we're not spinning at all and I did

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.540 
this we're not spinning at all and I did
the<00:02:49.300> same<00:02:49.450> thing<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.780> let<00:02:49.930> go<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:51.400> just

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
the same thing and I let go it just

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.970 
the same thing and I let go it just
falls<00:02:51.730> over<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:53.110> how<00:02:53.290> do<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> motors<00:02:53.800> inside

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
falls over so how do the motors inside

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.310 
falls over so how do the motors inside
work<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.730> get<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.269> move<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.720> roll<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.170> the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
work to get it to move to roll in the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.800 
work to get it to move to roll in the
return<00:02:57.220> basically<00:02:58.180> there's<00:02:58.480> there's<00:02:58.750> two

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
return basically there's there's two

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.630 
return basically there's there's two
drive<00:02:59.140> motors<00:02:59.530> it<00:03:00.010> almost<00:03:00.190> works<00:03:00.430> kind<00:03:00.610> of

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
drive motors it almost works kind of

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.490 
drive motors it almost works kind of
like<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.790> tank<00:03:01.600> drive<00:03:01.840> where<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.110> have<00:03:02.260> two

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
like a tank drive where you have two

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.600 
like a tank drive where you have two
treads<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.010> if<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.160> drive<00:03:03.370> them<00:03:03.489> together

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
treads and if you drive them together

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.699 
treads and if you drive them together
you<00:03:03.970> go<00:03:04.060> forward<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:05.049> if<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.350> drive<00:03:05.560> them

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
you go forward and if you drive them

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.350 
you go forward and if you drive them
opposite<00:03:06.280> each<00:03:06.430> other<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.670> can<00:03:06.790> turn<00:03:06.970> right

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
opposite each other you can turn right

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.259 
opposite each other you can turn right
so<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.350> case<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.860> similar<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:09.670> instead

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
so in this case it's similar but instead

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.810 
so in this case it's similar but instead
it<00:03:10.570> uses<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.870> differential<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.640> if<00:03:12.730> you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
it uses a differential so if you

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.460 
it uses a differential so if you
actually<00:03:13.090> drive<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.420> two<00:03:13.570> motors<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
actually drive the two motors in the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.050 
actually drive the two motors in the
opposite<00:03:14.739> directions<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:15.280> goes

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
opposite directions it goes

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.610 
opposite directions it goes
and<00:03:16.630> backward<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.020> if<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.200> drive<00:03:17.410> them<00:03:17.530> in

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
and backward and if you drive them in

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.720 
and backward and if you drive them in
the<00:03:17.680> same<00:03:17.860> direction<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.370> causes<00:03:18.610> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
the same direction it causes the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.190 
the same direction it causes the
pendulum<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.120> tilt<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.510> side<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:19.990> you<00:03:20.020> can

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
pendulum to tilt to the side so you can

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.040 
pendulum to tilt to the side so you can
drive<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.710> an<00:03:20.860> arc<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.970> uses<00:03:22.330> just<00:03:22.720> battery

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
drive in an arc it uses just battery

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.810 
drive in an arc it uses just battery
power<00:03:23.230> basically<00:03:23.710> most<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.580> components

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
power basically most of the components

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.570 
power basically most of the components
in<00:03:25.090> here<00:03:25.120> are<00:03:25.570> RC<00:03:26.290> car<00:03:26.500> parts<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> motors

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
in here are RC car parts like the motors

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.160 
in here are RC car parts like the motors
RC<00:03:27.940> car<00:03:28.090> motors<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.540> batteries<00:03:28.810> are<00:03:28.930> -

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
RC car motors and the batteries are -

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.680 
RC car motors and the batteries are -
it's<00:03:29.920> amazing<00:03:30.490> but<00:03:30.970> what<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.270> it<00:03:31.420> what<00:03:31.570> would

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's amazing but what is it what would

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.500 
it's amazing but what is it what would
it<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:32.170> used<00:03:32.920> for<00:03:33.070> there<00:03:33.700> are<00:03:33.820> advantages<00:03:34.060> to
