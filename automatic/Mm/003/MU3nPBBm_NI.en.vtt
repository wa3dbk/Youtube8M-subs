00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.480
 these alarms were sold from the 80s to 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.940
 the end of 2000 and they were quite 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.850
 popular and quite effective the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.300
 problem is that it stopped selling and 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.429
 there are no longer spare parts 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.210
 what usually fails in these devices 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:25.689
 it is often the tip of the key or 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.430
 the socket where the key enters 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.279
 we have the problem to deactivate it 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.980
 As you can see, this is working well. 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.170
 what I want to show in this video is how 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.030
 make an emergency deactivation in 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.579
 case the socket no longer works 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.230
 well it's pretty common but it's pretty 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.390
 simple also repair everything 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.610
 we need is a cross screwdriver 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.979
 to dismantle it from below the board 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.289
 which is where it is usually installed already 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.969
 It is mounted with two screws what 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.329
 we have to do is already one time 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.710
 disassembled on the socket is to disarm it 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.190
 to access the card 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.970
 contact electronics and led 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.039
 inside is the card and there are no 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.159
 blocking circuits is to say a thief 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.100
 can not deactivate 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.649
 this system simply by deactivating 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.619
 this card because here there is nothing 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.049
 he can do if the key does not have the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.590
 key possesses a code an encoded chip 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:27.229
 and it is impossible to copy 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.560
 and now I have it here at the table 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.479
 of work but this has to be done 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.830
 being the equipment still installed in 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.050
 the car is to say nothing else we disarm the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.530
 the base of the socket to access the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.110
 card and be able to access the part 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.820
 below this and thus be able to deactivate 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.620
 the immobilizer but all that 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.110
 we have to do is locate these two 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.660
 points this track here that leads 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.000
 several contacts and that goes out and 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.550
 the track on this side that is the one that goes to 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.100
 the tip of the key is actually 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.230
 little box here is the socket that receives 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.480
 the key and all he does is this 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.060
 contact here when it fails what 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.399
 we do is disarm this card and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.890
 place the key so that it touches 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.090
 these two points to be able to disable 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.430
 our immobilizer we do this 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.780
 contact three times to place it in 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.850
 ballet mode and so be able to carry 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.030
 our car to a service workshop 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.920
 sometimes also apart from the fault 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.050
 from the socket we can find that the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.260
 cables here can be broken or 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.140
 cleared we just follow the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.120
 clues that we see here on the card and 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.600
 so we can see from where to where 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.310
 connect the key if we are going to connect 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.010
 in the cables we would have to connect it 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.800
 in the way that the key makes contact 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.140
 the tip of the key to this cable and the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.620
 another to this one here because if we see 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.570
 we continue lateral to the card we see that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.580
 this cable here that is the cable 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.280
 number 4 counting from that of the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.000
 white stripe is the one that goes to the tip of 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.520
 the key and the other is the negative of the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.560
 key will connect in this way and so 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.490
 we can start our car and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.490
 take him to a workshop
