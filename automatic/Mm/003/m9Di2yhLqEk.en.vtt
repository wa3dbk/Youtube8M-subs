00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
I can't tell you how many times I've

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.390 
I can't tell you how many times I've
came<00:00:03.379> across<00:00:03.649> some<00:00:04.550> sighting<00:00:05.450> or<00:00:06.200> a<00:00:06.890> building

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
came across some sighting or a building

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.880 
came across some sighting or a building
framing<00:00:08.000> anything<00:00:08.570> where<00:00:08.870> the<00:00:09.230> nail<00:00:09.470> pressure

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:09.890 
framing anything where the nail pressure

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.240 
framing anything where the nail pressure
on<00:00:10.820> the<00:00:11.330> gun<00:00:11.600> the<00:00:12.080> nail<00:00:12.290> gun<00:00:12.470> was<00:00:12.740> a<00:00:12.769> little<00:00:13.070> too

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
on the gun the nail gun was a little too

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.640 
on the gun the nail gun was a little too
high<00:00:13.490> and<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.150> buried<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.690> nails<00:00:14.930> just<00:00:15.170> like

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
high and it buried the nails just like

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.079 
high and it buried the nails just like
what<00:00:15.860> we're<00:00:16.039> looking<00:00:16.339> at<00:00:16.490> here<00:00:16.669> in<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.849> fence

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:17.089 
what we're looking at here in the fence

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.689 
what we're looking at here in the fence
now<00:00:17.269> I<00:00:17.300> realize<00:00:17.839> you're<00:00:18.079> not<00:00:18.259> going<00:00:18.619> to<00:00:18.829> be

now I realize you're not going to be

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.159 
now I realize you're not going to be
able<00:00:19.849> to<00:00:20.029> get<00:00:20.839> a<00:00:20.869> good<00:00:21.079> shot<00:00:21.140> of<00:00:21.409> this<00:00:21.769> baby<00:00:22.099> but

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
able to get a good shot of this baby but

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.389 
able to get a good shot of this baby but
the<00:00:24.169> nails<00:00:24.769> are<00:00:25.220> at<00:00:25.789> least<00:00:26.409> at<00:00:27.409> least<00:00:27.470> a

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
the nails are at least at least a

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.790 
the nails are at least at least a
quarter<00:00:29.089> of<00:00:29.179> an<00:00:29.269> inch<00:00:29.449> now<00:00:30.259> some<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:30.560> them

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
quarter of an inch now some of them

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.209 
quarter of an inch now some of them
probably<00:00:31.039> about<00:00:31.519> halfway<00:00:31.939> through<00:00:32.269> these

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
probably about halfway through these

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.279 
probably about halfway through these
fence<00:00:34.219> boards<00:00:34.640> which<00:00:34.850> are<00:00:35.090> between<00:00:35.300> 5/8<00:00:35.960> of<00:00:36.140> an

inch and 3/4 of an inch thick and in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.880 
inch and 3/4 of an inch thick and in
this<00:00:41.090> picture<00:00:41.510> here<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:42.260> can<00:00:42.410> actually<00:00:42.679> see

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
this picture here you can actually see

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.759 
this picture here you can actually see
one<00:00:43.340> nail<00:00:43.579> sticking<00:00:44.000> out<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.440> course<00:00:45.469> I'm

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
one nail sticking out and of course I'm

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.950 
one nail sticking out and of course I'm
going<00:00:45.859> to<00:00:45.949> zoom<00:00:46.160> in<00:00:46.460> on<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.940> it's<00:00:47.629> in<00:00:47.839> the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
going to zoom in on that it's in the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.069 
going to zoom in on that it's in the
center<00:00:48.379> of<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.010> picture<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.329> of<00:00:50.690> course<00:00:50.899> all

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
center of the picture and of course all

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.779 
center of the picture and of course all
you<00:00:51.170> would<00:00:51.320> need<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.589> do<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:51.949> hammer<00:00:52.219> this<00:00:52.519> baby

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
you would need to do is hammer this baby

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.630 
you would need to do is hammer this baby
in<00:00:53.089> a<00:00:53.120> little<00:00:53.480> bit<00:00:53.690> now<00:00:53.929> there<00:00:54.379> are<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:55.190> few

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
in a little bit now there are a few

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.200 
in a little bit now there are a few
things<00:00:56.359> you<00:00:56.629> can<00:00:56.839> do<00:00:57.079> one<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.559> them<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.370> to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
things you can do one of them is to

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.810 
things you can do one of them is to
lower<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.899> air<00:01:00.379> pressure<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:01.159> your

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
lower the air pressure on your

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.450 
lower the air pressure on your
compressor<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.289> let's<00:01:03.620> say<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:03.829> have<00:01:04.100> the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
compressor so let's say you have the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.330 
compressor so let's say you have the
compressor<00:01:05.390> set<00:01:05.690> at<00:01:05.870> a<00:01:05.900> hundred<00:01:06.140> pounds<00:01:06.830> try

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
compressor set at a hundred pounds try

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.380 
compressor set at a hundred pounds try
lowering<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.940> 90<00:01:08.390> or<00:01:08.630> 80<00:01:09.380> and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
lowering it to 90 or 80 and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.060 
lowering it to 90 or 80 and
realistically<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.540> could<00:01:11.690> always<00:01:11.900> nail<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
realistically you could always nail the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.450 
realistically you could always nail the
board's<00:01:13.520> in<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.570> if<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.320> nails<00:01:15.560> are<00:01:15.920> sticking

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
board's in and if the nails are sticking

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.640 
board's in and if the nails are sticking
up<00:01:16.700> if<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.330> nails<00:01:17.510> are<00:01:17.690> sticking<00:01:18.050> out<00:01:18.200> just<00:01:18.530> a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
up if the nails are sticking out just a

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.740 
up if the nails are sticking out just a
little<00:01:18.680> bit<00:01:19.070> go<00:01:19.640> back<00:01:19.820> with<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> hammer<00:01:20.330> one

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
little bit go back with a hammer one

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.410 
little bit go back with a hammer one
whack<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.410> drive<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.890> rest<00:01:22.010> of<00:01:22.280> them<00:01:22.400> in<00:01:22.610> and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
whack and drive the rest of them in and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.240 
whack and drive the rest of them in and
and<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.840> course<00:01:24.020> there<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.350> another<00:01:24.380> thing<00:01:25.100> you

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
and of course there is another thing you

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.010 
and of course there is another thing you
can<00:01:25.430> use<00:01:25.490> too<00:01:25.940> when<00:01:26.120> it's<00:01:26.270> called<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.630> flush

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
can use too when it's called a flush

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.890 
can use too when it's called a flush
nailer<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:28.430> would<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:28.820> an<00:01:29.120> attachment<00:01:29.540> that

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
nailer this would be an attachment that

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
nailer this would be an attachment that
attaches<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.560> most<00:01:31.010> nail<00:01:31.460> guns<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.180> again

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
attaches to most nail guns so again

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.890 
attaches to most nail guns so again
flush<00:01:33.920> nailer<00:01:34.430> if<00:01:35.120> you<00:01:35.360> don't<00:01:35.510> want<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.750> do

now<00:01:42.680> for<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.340> bad<00:01:43.520> news<00:01:43.600> I've<00:01:44.600> actually<00:01:44.870> had

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
now for the bad news I've actually had

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.610 
now for the bad news I've actually had
projects<00:01:47.120> like<00:01:47.390> these<00:01:47.630> where<00:01:48.080> I've<00:01:48.260> took<00:01:48.470> in

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
projects like these where I've took in

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.640 
projects like these where I've took in
I've<00:01:48.770> taken<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.310> fence<00:01:49.910> down<00:01:50.180> or<00:01:50.510> taking<00:01:51.470> some

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
I've taken the fence down or taking some

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.740 
I've taken the fence down or taking some
siding<00:01:52.070> off<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.640> would<00:01:52.760> be<00:01:52.880> surprised<00:01:53.450> at

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
siding off and you would be surprised at

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.910 
siding off and you would be surprised at
how<00:01:54.040> little<00:01:55.040> effort<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:56.030> takes<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:57.350> pull

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
how little effort it takes to pull

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.670 
how little effort it takes to pull
something<00:01:58.400> like<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.610> off<00:01:59.230> and<00:02:00.230> leave<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
something like this off and leave the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.330 
something like this off and leave the
nails<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.670> again<00:02:02.000> I've<00:02:02.270> seen<00:02:02.540> I've<00:02:02.990> seen

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
nails in and again I've seen I've seen

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.560 
nails in and again I've seen I've seen
fences<00:02:04.340> where<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.760> nails<00:02:04.970> have<00:02:05.150> been<00:02:05.270> buried

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
fences where the nails have been buried

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.540 
fences where the nails have been buried
so<00:02:05.750> far<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.650> fence<00:02:06.950> boards<00:02:07.340> have

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
so far that the fence boards have

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.300 
so far that the fence boards have
actually<00:02:08.000> popped<00:02:08.300> off<00:02:08.570> by<00:02:08.840> themselves

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
actually popped off by themselves

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.830 
actually popped off by themselves
because<00:02:10.310> there<00:02:10.640> isn't<00:02:10.910> much<00:02:11.060> holding<00:02:11.450> them<00:02:11.600> on

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
because there isn't much holding them on

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.440 
because there isn't much holding them on
so<00:02:12.200> again<00:02:12.620> anyone<00:02:13.310> out<00:02:13.610> there<00:02:13.670> who's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
so again anyone out there who's

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.949 
so again anyone out there who's
arrested<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:14.989> doing<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.440> good<00:02:15.709> job<00:02:16.959> shouldn't

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
arrested in doing a good job shouldn't

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.750 
arrested in doing a good job shouldn't
should<00:02:18.620> be<00:02:18.769> aware<00:02:19.069> of<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:20.390> situation<00:02:20.900> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
should be aware of this situation and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.200 
should be aware of this situation and
compensate<00:02:22.760> for<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.390> whenever<00:02:23.870> possible
