00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.950
 welcome to cooking school today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.950
 let's learn to clean the beans 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.320
 the beans belong to the family of 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.660
 legumes and are commercially available from 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.700
 March to July can be found either 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.910
 fresh and dried we see together how 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.310
 first they can clean themselves 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.590
 find fresh or dried broad beans 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.290
 dry ones can be found both with 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.210
 the skin is peeled off the difference 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.360
 among the latter is the soaking time 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.479
 16 hours required for dried beans 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.600
 with the skin or 8 10 hours for the 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.879
 Hulled beans in case you have instead 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.010
 the fresh broad beans cut off one of the two 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.129
 end of the pod and divide it a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.900
 half opening it extract the seeds passing 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.900
 the thumb along the inside of the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.330
 pod now eliminate the growth that 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.949
 cover the seed of the broad bean by making a 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.100
 slight pressure with your fingers 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.659
 only once the growth has been removed 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.000
 you can tell if the beans are fresh 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.280
 or not in fact if under the growth 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.479
 the light color means that the broad bean e 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.000
 fresh of the day 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.010
 if instead the color will be black it will mean 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.650
 that the beans have been harvested by now 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.750
 a few days and therefore it is necessary to deprive them 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.840
 of the thin layer of skin that surrounds it 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.790
 the seeds to remove the skin with 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.400
 fingers press lightly on 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.560
 peel or cut with 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.840
 a small knife and remove the film 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.610
 external of the broad bean at this point the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.160
 your beans are ready to be 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.470
 eat raw or be cooked 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.420
 fresh broad beans are very delicate yes 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.260
 they keep a maximum of two in the refrigerator 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.000
 three days 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.160
 alternatively you can store it in 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.920
 frost bags tightly closed and freeze them 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.990
 dried broad beans instead are preserved from 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.000
 four to six months in containers well 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.230
 closed and placed in a cool and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.230
 dry so not in the refrigerator
