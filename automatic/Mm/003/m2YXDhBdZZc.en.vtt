00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.230

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:12.340
 today I come to teach you how to download 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:16.090
 high school books open what 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 first thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.440
 this address that I'm going to leave you there 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.440
 in the description of the video 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.480
 and here as we see 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.560
 there are several things like calendars 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.560
 of exams 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.390
 some other blogs like to have 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.070
 online math courses and 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.070
 online tutorials 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 and equipment some items like that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.370
 interest but to us what we 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 interesting are the books for this 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.440
 we just click on this 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.440
 in the name of the book that interests us 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.170
 also this case I'm interested in English 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.630
 3 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.119
 since I just formed my computer and 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.640
 this subject is the one I am studying 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.620
 so I'll also take advantage once 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.690
 to download 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.460
 here is very simple when it comes to 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.950
 to download 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.280
 we just give him a link here 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.280
 in this case we see that English 3 has 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.390
 455 links and two for the notebook 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.390
 work 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.310
 ok let's download the first 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.740

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.010
 media player we just give you everything 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.700

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.020
 and well, good friends, that would be all 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.190

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.960

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.080
