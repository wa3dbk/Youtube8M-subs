00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello everyone, Alexander the Bird and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.779
 today we are learning to play a group song 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 the pilot rolled the full version of my camera 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.809
 in the description of the video so as not to delay 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.150
 the lesson we start 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.070
 this song will be built on this 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.460
 bust but on extreme and my camera 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.900
 look we play bass country 6 5 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.880
 or 4 let it be for example 4 then 3 2 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.240
 3 1 side 3 2 and 3 that is normal 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.640
 tempo 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.570
 it will sound like a chord clamp 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.170
 2corda d 4 rattle bolts and try 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170
 play together 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.010
 okay i hope you have a brute force site 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.300
 It turned out and I remind that we do not 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.250
 be sure to play it like that 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.450
 designs we can transfer all this 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.180
 case for example 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.910
 can play 5 bass and these fingers 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.470
 leave here either 6 bases and all these three 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.470
 move fingers for example so 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.280
 ok, let's deal with you as 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.470
 nose entry is played all offensive 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.729
 the song is played equally normal 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.210
 tempo it will sound as follows 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.210
 way 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.100
 ok let 's see 1 you already 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.100
 you know, we put a chord and we play 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.560
 then we transfer middle fingers to the sixth 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.560
 country 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.740
 that's the same thing 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.210
 pay attention we played this 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.210
 the moment yes when I play the second time 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.070
 look accepted play so we 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.230
 accustomed to becoming chords and yes everything is fine 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.150
 soap set if we fall short we 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.060
 we can take some derivatives yes but 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.100
 where does the little finger come from but if you 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.690
 while it is inconvenient to do it and in principle 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.350
 it would be more professional not 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.660
 pinch 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.610
 middle finger on 1 page they don't care 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.590
 you screw up no sense we pinch 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.520
 on young again being conducted 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.520
 just hold it like that 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.470
 ok with that and let's take 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.450
 play slowly 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.590
 introduction and first verse 2 verse 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.590
 will be played and exactly the same 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:15.030
 we fill the hills to the purple sky 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.030
 worth it 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.170
 by the window in the chair 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:31.180
 under the green blanket 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.180
 he sleeps 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.660
 people ran away 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.050
 threw things 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.050
 such a thing and war 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.550
 own skin more expensive 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.860
 understandably with cat dust 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.360
 and what about when the feather chorus is also all 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.610
 go to our chords with which the series 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.510
 let's start on the word cat you forget 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.510
 cat 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:31.300
 it was time to remember and take it with you 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:46.380
 but before the beast, will he probably tell you 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:55.470
 Kirill is full 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.210
 where there is a horse in the mane and so on 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.830
 the next song is played the same way as we 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.199
 you figured out the first entry and 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.569
 couplet well i hope this video 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.650
 a lesson for you was helpful and and see you 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.650
 in new lessons for now
