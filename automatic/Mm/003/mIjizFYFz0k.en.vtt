00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
those two bars would sound like if we

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.240 
those two bars would sound like if we
play<00:01:25.810> corn<00:01:26.200> oats<00:01:26.410> so<00:01:26.619> again<00:01:26.830> if<00:01:26.950> your<00:01:27.070> right

eighth<00:01:29.380> notes<00:01:29.500> then<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:29.979> can<00:01:30.160> transfer<00:01:30.700> to

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
eighth notes then you can transfer to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.810 
eighth notes then you can transfer to
quarter<00:01:31.780> notes<00:01:31.960> instead<00:01:32.320> so<00:01:33.100> all<00:01:33.520> those

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
quarter notes instead so all those

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.910 
quarter notes instead so all those
patients<00:01:34.119> although<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.380> majority<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.860> those

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
patients although the majority of those

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.290 
patients although the majority of those
patients<00:01:36.160> are<00:01:36.490> falling<00:01:36.789> on<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.970> ends<00:01:37.240> are

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
patients are falling on the ends are

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.730 
patients are falling on the ends are
going<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.479> fall<00:01:37.630> in<00:01:37.810> between<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.289> high<00:01:38.470> hats

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
those two bars will sound like this one

00:01:43.479 --> 00:02:04.560 
those two bars will sound like this one
and<00:01:43.720> two<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.680> three<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.420> really

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
and two and three so if you really

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.609 
and two and three so if you really
finding<00:02:04.899> it<00:02:04.990> hard<00:02:05.170> then<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.380> can<00:02:05.500> go<00:02:05.590> to

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
finding it hard then you can go to

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.410 
finding it hard then you can go to
quarter<00:02:06.009> notes<00:02:06.190> but<00:02:06.429> that<00:02:06.759> might<00:02:06.970> as<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.240> said

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420

ends with the open hi-hat and sounds

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:45.030 
ends with the open hi-hat and sounds
like<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.569> slowly<00:02:34.720> 1<00:02:35.680> 2<00:02:36.160> 3<00:02:36.660> 1<00:02:37.660> 2<00:02:37.690> 3<00:02:43.890> opens<00:02:44.890> and

like this slowly 1 2 3 1 2 3 opens and
for<00:02:45.250> all<00:02:45.849> 1<00:02:46.360> closes<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.140> one<00:02:47.349> of<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> next<00:02:47.860> line

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:14.000 

I<00:03:11.900> notice<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:12.989> you've<00:03:13.110> Aries<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.769> when<00:03:13.950> he

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
I notice that you've Aries it when he

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.100 
I notice that you've Aries it when he
plays<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.430> live<00:03:14.670> he<00:03:15.299> tends<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.690> play<00:03:15.870> that

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
plays it live he tends to play that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.440 
plays it live he tends to play that
version<00:03:16.349> more<00:03:16.739> often<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.760> recording<00:03:18.329> I've

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
version more often so the recording I've

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.970 
version more often so the recording I've
shown<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:18.930> exactly<00:03:19.349> what<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.560> plays<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.890> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
shown you exactly what you plays on the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.619 
shown you exactly what you plays on the
recording<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.579> bear<00:03:20.819> in<00:03:20.970> mind<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.390> when<00:03:21.569> you

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
recording but bear in mind that when you

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.300 
recording but bear in mind that when you
played<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.019> live<00:03:22.170> he<00:03:22.349> changes<00:03:22.829> things

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
played it live he changes things

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.039 
played it live he changes things
he<00:03:23.579> definitely<00:03:23.819> adds<00:03:24.150> extra<00:03:24.360> scratch<00:03:24.690> cymbals

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
he definitely adds extra scratch cymbals

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.059 
he definitely adds extra scratch cymbals
in<00:03:25.109> places<00:03:25.500> he<00:03:25.560> didn't<00:03:25.799> play<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
in places he didn't play on the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.240 
in places he didn't play on the
recording<00:03:26.640> because<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.810> energy<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.379> the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
recording because the energy of the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.979 
recording because the energy of the
audience<00:03:29.370> demands<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.450> know<00:03:30.540> if<00:03:30.810> you're

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
audience demands it you know if you're

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.170 
audience demands it you know if you're
just<00:03:31.170> playing<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:32.129> studio<00:03:32.340> version<00:03:32.700> and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
just playing the studio version and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.449 
just playing the studio version and
you're<00:03:33.810> not<00:03:33.959> living<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.530> moment<00:03:34.890> when

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
you're not living in the moment when

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.280 
you're not living in the moment when
you're<00:03:35.549> performing<00:03:36.359> it<00:03:36.690> live<00:03:36.840> then<00:03:37.200> you're

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
you're performing it live then you're

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.599 
you're performing it live then you're
gonna<00:03:37.379> miss<00:03:37.620> out<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.829> little<00:03:38.040> bit<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> drummer

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
gonna miss out a little bit a drummer

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.220 
gonna miss out a little bit a drummer
