and<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.260> super<00:01:01.770> impatient<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.879> guessing<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and I'm super impatient I'm guessing you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.170 
and I'm super impatient I'm guessing you
are<00:01:03.570> too<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.549> might<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.729> want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> get

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
are too so you might just want to get

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.100 
are too so you might just want to get
nine<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.860> but<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.189> future<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
nine for now but in the future the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.190 
nine for now but in the future the
plants<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> harvest<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.310> drop<00:01:11.810> more<00:01:12.810> seeds

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
plants you harvest will drop more seeds

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.070 
plants you harvest will drop more seeds
so<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.640> amount<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.880> seeds<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.509> will

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
so the amount of seeds you have will

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
so the amount of seeds you have will
increase<00:01:16.619> over<00:01:17.220> time<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:18.060> cycle<00:01:18.330> just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
increase over time and my cycle just

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.260 
increase over time and my cycle just
broke<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> do

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
broke all right so what you want to do

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.550 
broke all right so what you want to do
is<00:01:21.920> after<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.310> seeds<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
is after you get your seeds you want to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.730 
is after you get your seeds you want to
create<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.670> area<00:01:27.090> where<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.170> farm<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.590> going

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
create an area where your farm is going

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.330 
create an area where your farm is going
to<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:29.630> which<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.259> main<00:01:31.799> thing<00:01:32.070> about

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
creating this area is you want it to be

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.950 
creating this area is you want it to be
blocked<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:35.549> cows<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.570> pigs<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.260 
it to probably be about three blocks
wide<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:09.649> made<00:02:10.649> mine<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.160> pretty<00:02:12.000> much<00:02:12.120> on

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
wide I made mine for pretty much on

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.990 
wide I made mine for pretty much on
accident<00:02:12.690> too<00:02:13.319> lazy<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.620> fix

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
accident too lazy to fix

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.090 
accident too lazy to fix
but<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.960> reason<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.320> say<00:02:15.350> make<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.830> three<00:02:16.010> is

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
but the reason I say make it three is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.430 
but the reason I say make it three is
because<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.970> get<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.480> back<00:02:17.810> one<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.230> kind

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
because to get to that back one you kind

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.550 
because to get to that back one you kind
of<00:02:18.470> gotta<00:02:18.650> walk<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:21.290> over

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
of gotta walk on this one and like over

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.130 
of gotta walk on this one and like over
there<00:02:21.740> it's<00:02:22.180> bad<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.720> because<00:02:23.900> you

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
there it's bad to do that because you

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.440 
there it's bad to do that because you
destroy<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.950> did<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.090> want

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
destroy it just like I did so you want

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.940 
destroy it just like I did so you want
to<00:02:26.510> make<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.690> three<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.650> want<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.890> make

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
to make it three and you want to make

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.240 
to make it three and you want to make
sure<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.640> got<00:02:29.360> water<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.570> both<00:02:29.720> sides<00:02:30.250> any

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
sure it's a got water on both sides any

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.100 
sure it's a got water on both sides any
one<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.520> my<00:02:31.610> shirts<00:02:31.760> blocked<00:02:32.060> off<00:02:32.240> that's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
one of my shirts blocked off that's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.720 
one of my shirts blocked off that's
pretty<00:02:33.709> much<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:33.980> pretty<00:02:34.160> much<00:02:34.280> as<00:02:34.459> simple

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
pretty much it's pretty much as simple

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.820 
pretty much it's pretty much as simple
as<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:34.880> um<00:02:36.880> you'll<00:02:37.880> know<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:39.410> weed<00:02:39.680> is

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
as that um you'll know the the weed is

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.890 
as that um you'll know the the weed is
done<00:02:40.270> that's<00:02:41.270> what<00:02:41.390> you're<00:02:41.480> going<00:02:41.630> right<00:02:41.780> now

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
done that's what you're going right now

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.560 
done that's what you're going right now
just<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.040> FYI<00:02:43.220> but<00:02:43.790> you'll<00:02:44.300> know<00:02:44.420> it's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
just just a FYI but you'll know it's

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.050 
just just a FYI but you'll know it's
done<00:02:44.750> when<00:02:45.070> these<00:02:46.070> kind<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.370> have<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.550> goldish

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
done when these kind of have a goldish

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060 
done when these kind of have a goldish
tint<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.720> top<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.230> them<00:02:48.380> not<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.590> bottom

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
tint to the top of them not the bottom

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.440 
tint to the top of them not the bottom
so<00:02:49.220> they<00:02:49.340> kind<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.580> got<00:02:49.700> like<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.300> little

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
so they kind of got like a little

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.120 
so they kind of got like a little
yellowy<00:02:50.989> thing<00:02:51.230> going<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.530> down<00:02:51.770> there<00:02:51.950> but

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
yellowy thing going on down there but

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.610 
yellowy thing going on down there but
they'll<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.820> kind<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> goldie<00:02:54.230> brown

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
they'll have kind of like a goldie brown

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.300 
they'll have kind of like a goldie brown
look<00:02:54.950> looking<00:02:55.520> thing<00:02:55.700> going<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.030> on<00:02:56.540> top<00:02:57.310> so

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
look looking thing going on on top so

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.310 
look looking thing going on on top so
you<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:58.910> harvest<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.660> when<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.020> gets<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.260> that

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
you just harvest it when it gets to that

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.940 
you just harvest it when it gets to that
point<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.870> then<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.020> just<00:03:03.230> rinse<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.860> repeat

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
point and then you just rinse and repeat

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.780 
point and then you just rinse and repeat
so<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.150> really<00:03:05.630> not<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.870> hard<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.790> get

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
so it's really not that hard you get

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.970 
so it's really not that hard you get
stuff<00:03:08.330> very<00:03:08.690> fast<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.260> probably<00:03:09.440> gathered

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
stuff very fast I probably gathered

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.430 
stuff very fast I probably gathered
three<00:03:10.190> times<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:11.180> have<00:03:11.420> three<00:03:11.930> sacks<00:03:12.230> of
