hi<00:00:00.210> handsome<00:00:00.480> Nicky<00:00:00.870> speaking<00:00:01.110> it<00:00:01.380> today

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
hi handsome Nicky speaking it today

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.020 
hi handsome Nicky speaking it today
we're<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.949> see<00:00:02.070> where<00:00:02.220> Venus<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.730> hotter

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
we're going to see where Venus is hotter

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.090 
we're going to see where Venus is hotter
than<00:00:03.149> mercury<00:00:03.540> even<00:00:04.410> though<00:00:04.529> mercury<00:00:05.009> is

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
than mercury even though mercury is

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.249 
than mercury even though mercury is
closer<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.759> Sun<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.150> Venus<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.629> like<00:00:07.109> you

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
closer to the Sun and Venus is like you

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.810 
closer to the Sun and Venus is like you
probably<00:00:07.560> know<00:00:07.830> what<00:00:08.069> mercury<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
probably know what mercury is the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.970 
probably know what mercury is the
closest<00:00:09.300> planet<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.780> Sun<00:00:09.900> Venus<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
closest planet to the Sun Venus is the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.620 
closest planet to the Sun Venus is the
oddest<00:00:11.460> even<00:00:11.880> though<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.120> way<00:00:12.330> beyond

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
oddest even though it's way beyond

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.259 
oddest even though it's way beyond
mercury<00:00:13.110> which<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.650> logical<00:00:14.400> since<00:00:14.639> generally

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
mercury which is logical since generally

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.880 
mercury which is logical since generally
planets<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:15.839> closer<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.529> Sun<00:00:16.710> are

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
planets that are closer to the Sun are

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.519 
planets that are closer to the Sun are
hotter<00:00:17.160> than<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.789> far<00:00:18.090> away<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:19.289> reality

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
hotter than one far away and in reality

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.290 
hotter than one far away and in reality
even<00:00:20.189> though<00:00:20.310> our<00:00:20.340> far<00:00:20.699> away<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.150> from

even though our far away you are from
the<00:00:21.570> Sun<00:00:21.750> plays<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> big<00:00:22.260> role<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the Sun plays a big role in the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.259 
the Sun plays a big role in the
temperature<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.580> not<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> only<00:00:24.000> thing<00:00:24.150> that

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
temperature it's not the only thing that

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
temperature it's not the only thing that
comes<00:00:24.630> another<00:00:25.380> thing<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.920> really

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
comes another thing that can really

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
comes another thing that can really
change<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.550> temperature<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> planet<00:00:27.539> is

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
change the temperature of a planet is

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.290 
change the temperature of a planet is
its<00:00:28.230> atmosphere<00:00:28.920> wherever<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
its atmosphere wherever it is the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880 
its atmosphere wherever it is the
composition<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> atmosphere<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
composition of the atmosphere or the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.910 
composition of the atmosphere or the
atmospheric<00:00:32.880> pressure<00:00:33.590> composition<00:00:34.590> because

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
atmospheric pressure composition because

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
atmospheric pressure composition because
some<00:00:35.190> cases<00:00:35.550> absorb<00:00:36.090> more<00:00:36.300> heat<00:00:36.360> than<00:00:36.809> others

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
some cases absorb more heat than others

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380 
some cases absorb more heat than others
and<00:00:37.380> pressure<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.760> gases<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and pressure because for gases the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
and pressure because for gases the
bigger<00:00:39.629> pressure<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.440> hotter<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> gets<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
bigger pressure the hotter it gets and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
bigger pressure the hotter it gets and
for<00:00:41.760> their<00:00:41.910> temperature<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.660> basically

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
for their temperature it's basically

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
for their temperature it's basically
those<00:00:43.379> two<00:00:43.590> criterias<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.399> differentiates

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
those two criterias that differentiates

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.540 
those two criterias that differentiates
Mercury<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.170> Venus<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.890> difference<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.430> that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
Mercury and Venus so difference is that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520 
Mercury and Venus so difference is that
mercury<00:00:47.820> has<00:00:48.210> almost<00:00:48.510> no<00:00:48.750> atmosphere<00:00:48.870> because

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
mercury has almost no atmosphere because

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.200 
mercury has almost no atmosphere because
it<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.160> small<00:00:50.430> planet<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
it is a really small planet the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.760 
it is a really small planet the
atmosphere<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.690> composed<00:00:51.989> mainly<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.469> gas

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
atmosphere is composed mainly of gas

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.529 
atmosphere is composed mainly of gas
that<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.039> not<00:00:53.250> greenhouse<00:00:53.670> gases<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that are not greenhouse gases at the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.450 
that are not greenhouse gases at the
contrary<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> pressure<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.559> Venus<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.100> really

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
contrary the pressure on Venus is really

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.240 
contrary the pressure on Venus is really
really<00:00:56.730> high<00:00:56.969> about<00:00:57.629> 92<00:00:58.199> times<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
really high about 92 times one on you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
really high about 92 times one on you
right<00:00:59.579> now<00:00:59.760> which<00:01:00.239> creates<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.719> lot<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> heat

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
right now which creates a lot of heat

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.470 
right now which creates a lot of heat
due<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.590> thermal<00:01:01.949> agitation<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:03.149> that's<00:01:03.300> not

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
due to thermal agitation but that's not

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.880 
due to thermal agitation but that's not
all<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:03.780> drachma<00:01:04.260> sphere<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> u.s.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
all because drachma sphere on the u.s.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
all because drachma sphere on the u.s.
is<00:01:04.979> composed<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> around<00:01:05.640> 96%<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.659> carbon

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
is composed of around 96% of carbon

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.899 
is composed of around 96% of carbon
dioxide<00:01:07.170> which<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.950> part<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> greenhouse

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

gas<00:01:09.180> which<00:01:09.420> allows<00:01:09.869> finished<00:01:10.229> chips<00:01:10.439> are

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
gas which allows finished chips are

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.620 
gas which allows finished chips are
really<00:01:10.890> weld<00:01:11.250> energy<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.390> why

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
really weld energy of this which is why

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.179 
really weld energy of this which is why

the day is about 420 degrees Celsius and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.170 
the day is about 420 degrees Celsius and
I'm<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:22.979> insisting<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.820> during<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I'm really insisting on the during the

I'm really insisting on the during the
day<00:01:24.390> path<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> temperature<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
day path because the temperature on

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
day path because the temperature on
mercury<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.570> need<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> lack

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
mercury there is a lot you need the lack

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
mercury there is a lot you need the lack
of<00:01:28.200> atmospheric<00:01:28.799> chips<00:01:29.100> mercury<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.729> my

living goal that heat at night that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.870 
living goal that heat at night that
makes<00:01:31.829> temperature<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.460> hard<00:01:32.640> during<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
makes temperature really hard during the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.819 
makes temperature really hard during the

temperatures average around minus 170
degrees<00:01:38.549> Celsius<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.240> night<00:01:39.479> while<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.140> Venus

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
degrees Celsius at night while on Venus

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
degrees Celsius at night while on Venus
jet<00:01:40.770> postrera<00:01:41.159> keeps<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> heat<00:01:41.759> even<00:01:42.119> at

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
jet postrera keeps the heat even at

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.910 
jet postrera keeps the heat even at
night<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> temperature<00:01:43.409> doesn't<00:01:43.619> change

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
night so the temperature doesn't change

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
night so the temperature doesn't change
a<00:01:44.040> lot<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.340> remains<00:01:44.759> about<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> same<00:01:45.149> during

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a lot and remains about the same during

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.660 
a lot and remains about the same during
the<00:01:46.049> day<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.500> at<00:01:46.530> night<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> sum<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.549> up

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the day or at night so to sum it up

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.399 
the day or at night so to sum it up
videos<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.180> hotter<00:01:48.509> than<00:01:48.600> mercury<00:01:48.930> because

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
videos is hotter than mercury because

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
videos is hotter than mercury because
it's<00:01:49.560> atmosphere<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.369> more<00:01:50.579> pressure<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it's atmosphere as more pressure and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
it's atmosphere as more pressure and
it's<00:01:52.170> mainly<00:01:52.439> composed<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.070> greenhouse<00:01:53.430> gases

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
it's mainly composed of greenhouse gases

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
it's mainly composed of greenhouse gases
which<00:01:54.450> makes<00:01:54.720> finish<00:01:55.079> hotter<00:01:55.439> than<00:01:55.680> mercury

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
which makes finish hotter than mercury

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.340 
which makes finish hotter than mercury
we<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.790> about<00:01:56.969> 40<00:01:57.479> degrees<00:01:57.810> during<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> day

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
we have about 40 degrees during the day

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.160 
we have about 40 degrees during the day
and<00:01:58.500> run<00:01:58.939> 630<00:01:59.939> degrees<00:02:00.329> Celsius<00:02:00.750> more<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and run 630 degrees Celsius more and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
and run 630 degrees Celsius more and
mercury<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.710> night<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.729> lot<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.540> if

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
mercury at night which is a lot so if

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.870 
mercury at night which is a lot so if
you<00:02:03.840> listened<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:05.009> why<00:02:05.280> Venus<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
you listened you now know why Venus is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
you listened you now know why Venus is
hotter<00:02:06.149> than<00:02:06.240> mercury<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.170> I'd<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> tell

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
hotter than mercury and I'd like to tell

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.010 
hotter than mercury and I'd like to tell
you<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.819> new<00:02:09.000> videos<00:02:09.300> will<00:02:09.450> come<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.929> the
