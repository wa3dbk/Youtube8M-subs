doing<00:00:59.190> nothing<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> play<00:01:00.469> what<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.590> like

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
doing nothing with the play what we like

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.240 
doing nothing with the play what we like
to<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.340> baseline<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> coverage<00:01:03.510> first

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
to do is baseline the coverage first

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
to do is baseline the coverage first
then<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.570> move

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
then all we really have to do is move

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.870 
then all we really have to do is move
that<00:01:06.930> blitzing<00:01:07.680> linebacker<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that blitzing linebacker on the right a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
that blitzing linebacker on the right a
little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.070> right<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
little bit to the right right there is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
little bit to the right right there is
good<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.360> bit<00:01:12.510> I'll<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> over<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
good a little bit I'll kind of over that

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
good a little bit I'll kind of over that
defensive<00:01:14.159> end<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> little<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
defensive end but a little bit to the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.380 
defensive end but a little bit to the
left<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.110> his<00:01:16.380> inside<00:01:17.220> hip<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
left so on his inside hip right in that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
left so on his inside hip right in that
spot<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.810> perfect<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> five<00:01:19.680> man<00:01:19.950> rush

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
spot is perfect so it's a five man rush

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.550 
spot is perfect so it's a five man rush
like<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.549> said<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:21.869> coverage<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
like I said we have good coverage and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.289 
like I said we have good coverage and
that<00:01:22.590> linebacker<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> scream<00:01:24.119> right

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
that linebacker is going to scream right

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.220 
that linebacker is going to scream right
up<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> B<00:01:24.689> gap<00:01:24.869> untouched<00:01:25.500> every<00:01:25.890> single<00:01:26.159> time

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.530 

now<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.190> might<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:32.790> good<00:01:33.060> you

occasionally<00:05:26.700> we<00:05:27.120> could<00:05:27.270> send<00:05:27.480> seven<00:05:27.990> call<00:05:28.230> me

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320

crazy<00:05:28.500> we're<00:05:28.920> not<00:05:29.040> going<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.220> do<00:05:29.280> this<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.430> lot

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
crazy we're not going to do this a lot

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.940 
crazy we're not going to do this a lot
but<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.510> send<00:05:30.780> seven<00:05:31.200> on<00:05:31.350> like<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.500> third<00:05:31.770> and

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
but you send seven on like a third and

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.560 
but you send seven on like a third and
long<00:05:32.160> when<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:32.910> know<00:05:33.090> they're<00:05:33.270> either<00:05:33.390> going

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
to block the running back or do a deep

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.150 
to block the running back or do a deep
ass<00:05:35.190> um<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:36.810> just<00:05:36.840> blitz<00:05:37.260> that<00:05:37.500> linebacker<00:05:37.740> on

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
ass um you just blitz that linebacker on

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.860 
ass um you just blitz that linebacker on
the<00:05:38.280> right<00:05:38.490> move<00:05:38.730> them<00:05:38.850> to<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.120> right<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.780> now

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
the right move them to the right and now

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.390 
the right move them to the right and now
you<00:05:39.930> can<00:05:40.230> just<00:05:40.410> pretty<00:05:40.650> much<00:05:40.830> sell<00:05:41.130> out<00:05:41.250> with

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
you can just pretty much sell out with

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.910 
you can just pretty much sell out with
your<00:05:41.490> coverage<00:05:41.850> put<00:05:42.090> them<00:05:42.210> all<00:05:42.360> in<00:05:42.510> yellows

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
your coverage put them all in yellows

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.860 
your coverage put them all in yellows
put<00:05:43.920> maybe<00:05:44.100> purple<00:05:44.370> corners<00:05:44.940> all<00:05:45.390> I<00:05:45.450> know<00:05:45.720> is

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
put maybe purple corners all I know is

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.810 
put maybe purple corners all I know is
you're<00:05:46.200> going<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.380> get<00:05:46.500> double<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.190> gap<00:05:47.520> blitz

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
you're going to get double a gap blitz

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.550 
you're going to get double a gap blitz
it's<00:05:48.360> not<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.600> greatest<00:05:48.870> defense<00:05:49.350> in<00:05:49.470> the

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
it's not the greatest defense in the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.840 
it's not the greatest defense in the
game<00:05:49.740> but<00:05:49.920> it's<00:05:50.070> definitely<00:05:50.250> something<00:05:50.610> to

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
game but it's definitely something to

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.490 
game but it's definitely something to
mix<00:05:51.090> in<00:05:51.240> with<00:05:51.360> all<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.660> other<00:05:51.810> defenses<00:05:52.470> that

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
mix in with all the other defenses that

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.520 
mix in with all the other defenses that

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
hard to come up with defense in this

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.620 
hard to come up with defense in this
