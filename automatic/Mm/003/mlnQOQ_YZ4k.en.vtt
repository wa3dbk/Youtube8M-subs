for someone to say that within a few
hours<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.639> can<00:04:38.789> read<00:04:38.970> something<00:04:39.270> or

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
hours that you can read something or

hours that you can read something or
that<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.900> can<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.410> know<00:04:40.500> change<00:04:40.530> your<00:04:40.919> mind<00:04:41.160> I

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
that you can you know change your mind I

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.670 
that you can you know change your mind I
find<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:41.910> maybe<00:04:42.090> I'm<00:04:42.270> just<00:04:42.449> very

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
find that maybe I'm just very

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.230 
find that maybe I'm just very
strong-minded<00:04:43.680> but<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.669> find<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:44.970> difficult

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
strong-minded but I find that difficult

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.629 
strong-minded but I find that difficult
to<00:04:45.930> almost<00:04:46.530> listen<00:04:46.979> I<00:04:47.099> would<00:04:47.250> have<00:04:47.340> thought<00:04:47.490> it

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
to almost listen I would have thought it

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.460 
to almost listen I would have thought it
impossible<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.630> few<00:04:48.780> years<00:04:48.960> ago<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.289> would<00:04:49.440> have

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
impossible a few years ago I would have

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.050 
impossible a few years ago I would have
proved<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.919> whole<00:04:50.069> thing<00:04:50.280> 100%<00:04:50.849> I<00:04:50.880> would<00:04:50.970> be

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
proved the whole thing 100% I would be

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.820 
proved the whole thing 100% I would be
sitting<00:04:51.270> there<00:04:51.389> indoors<00:04:52.080> now<00:04:52.229> again<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.590> was

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
sitting there indoors now again I was

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.260 
sitting there indoors now again I was
another<00:04:53.099> fat<00:04:53.370> it's<00:04:53.520> another<00:04:53.699> I<00:04:53.910> mean<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.120> would

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
another fat it's another I mean I would

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.450 
another fat it's another I mean I would
even<00:04:54.449> with<00:04:55.199> me<00:04:55.349> saying<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.740> makes<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.310> sound

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
even with me saying that makes it sound

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.890 
even with me saying that makes it sound
like<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.759> isn't<00:04:56.910> again<00:04:57.240> every<00:04:57.479> day<00:04:57.599> that<00:04:57.780> I'd

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
like it isn't again every day that I'd

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.330 
like it isn't again every day that I'd
be<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.259> skeptical<00:04:58.680> it's<00:04:58.919> something<00:04:59.130> that<00:04:59.220> you

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
be so skeptical it's something that you

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.279 
be so skeptical it's something that you
start<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.819> turbocharged<00:05:00.389> this<00:05:00.599> breakfast<00:05:01.080> do

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
start the turbocharged this breakfast do

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.719 
start the turbocharged this breakfast do
you<00:05:01.440> think<00:05:01.650> that'll<00:05:01.889> lead<00:05:02.039> to<00:05:02.069> other<00:05:02.370> traces

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
you think that'll lead to other traces

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.820 
you think that'll lead to other traces
it's<00:05:02.880> not<00:05:03.120> just<00:05:03.479> it's<00:05:03.690> not<00:05:03.750> about<00:05:04.289> me<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.650> must

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
it's not just it's not about me I must

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.290 
it's not just it's not about me I must
stress<00:05:05.069> this<00:05:05.220> enough<00:05:05.400> if<00:05:05.699> somebody<00:05:06.000> just

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
stress this enough if somebody just

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.640 
stress this enough if somebody just
literally<00:05:06.840> picked<00:05:07.050> up<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.259> book<00:05:07.409> on<00:05:07.590> it

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
literally picked up the book on it

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.439 
literally picked up the book on it
straight<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.099> 14-day<00:05:08.580> program<00:05:09.030> they

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
straight to the 14-day program they

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.240 
straight to the 14-day program they
would<00:05:09.599> fail<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.259> the<00:05:10.650> reason<00:05:10.860> why<00:05:10.979> they<00:05:11.099> would

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
would fail and the reason why they would

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.309 
would fail and the reason why they would
fail<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.789> because<00:05:11.819> they<00:05:12.659> haven't<00:05:12.930> changed

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
fail is because they haven't changed

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.379 
fail is because they haven't changed
their<00:05:13.409> psychology<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.490> key<00:05:14.699> behind<00:05:15.150> it

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
their psychology and the key behind it

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.020 
their psychology and the key behind it
is<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.599> change<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.289> psychology<00:05:16.800> once<00:05:17.639> you've

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
is to change the psychology once you've

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.180 
is to change the psychology once you've
done<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.419> part<00:05:19.139> of<00:05:19.289> it<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.560> don't<00:05:19.830> feel

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
done that part of it so you don't feel

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.980 
done that part of it so you don't feel
deprived<00:05:20.610> l<00:05:20.819> emphasize<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.300> as<00:05:21.419> much<00:05:21.720> as<00:05:21.750> I

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
deprived l emphasize that as much as I

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.439 
deprived l emphasize that as much as I
can<00:05:22.159> then<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.370> can<00:05:23.400> find<00:05:23.759> it<00:05:23.880> easy<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.330> then

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
can then you can find it easy and then

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.820 
can then you can find it easy and then
you'll<00:05:24.569> find<00:05:24.720> some<00:05:24.930> stuff<00:05:25.139> out<00:05:25.349> about<00:05:25.380> food

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
you'll find some stuff out about food

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.040 
you'll find some stuff out about food
that<00:05:25.979> you<00:05:26.069> I<00:05:26.310> not<00:05:26.729> have<00:05:26.849> known<00:05:27.060> I<00:05:27.330> mean<00:05:27.659> a<00:05:27.900> lot

work you'd have been phoned don't have
to<00:05:47.610> book<00:05:47.759> one<00:05:47.909> you're<00:05:48.090> on<00:05:48.120> book<00:05:48.449> five<00:05:48.719> so<00:05:48.960> you

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
to book one you're on book five so you

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.510 
to book one you're on book five so you
must<00:05:49.590> be<00:05:49.650> doing<00:05:49.860> something<00:05:50.039> right

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
must be doing something right

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.159 
must be doing something right
and<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.449> don't<00:05:51.539> mean<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.719> in<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.930> patronizing

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
and I don't mean that in a patronizing

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.290 
and I don't mean that in a patronizing
way<00:05:52.440> and<00:05:52.800> obviously<00:05:53.639> you're<00:05:53.940> doing<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.180> lot

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
way and obviously you're doing a lot

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.990 
way and obviously you're doing a lot
right<00:05:54.560> but<00:05:55.560> it's<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.219> healthy<00:05:56.520> little<00:05:56.639> dose<00:05:56.909> of

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
right but it's a healthy little dose of

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.370 
right but it's a healthy little dose of
cynicism<00:05:57.330> because<00:05:57.539> I<00:05:57.840> always<00:05:58.110> think<00:05:58.289> that

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
cynicism because I always think that
