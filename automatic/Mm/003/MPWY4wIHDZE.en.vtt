the Honda ATC 200 and in order for me to

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.069 
the Honda ATC 200 and in order for me to
start<00:00:21.700> it<00:00:21.880> I've<00:00:22.150> been<00:00:22.390> having<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:24.960> put<00:00:25.960> the

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
start it I've been having to put the

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.150

choke all the way down and then when it

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.690 
choke all the way down and then when it
starts<00:00:30.520> I<00:00:30.700> would<00:00:31.000> run<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.270> in<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.450> middle<00:00:31.720> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
starts I would run it in the middle and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.069 
starts I would run it in the middle and
pull<00:00:33.700> it<00:00:33.790> all<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:33.910> way<00:00:34.000> up<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.480> course<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.870> dies

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
pull it all the way up of course it dies

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.290 
pull it all the way up of course it dies
and<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:36.220> didn't<00:00:36.489> understand<00:00:36.850> exactly<00:00:36.970> what<00:00:37.270> was

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
and I didn't understand exactly what was

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.020 
and I didn't understand exactly what was
going<00:00:37.570> on<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:37.930> now<00:00:38.200> I<00:00:38.230> know<00:00:38.760> well<00:00:39.760> it<00:00:39.850> dies

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
going on so now I know well it dies

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.570 
going on so now I know well it dies
because<00:00:40.450> it's<00:00:40.630> completely<00:00:40.900> choked<00:00:44.310> and<00:00:45.310> I've

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
because it's completely choked and I've

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.700 
because it's completely choked and I've
been<00:00:45.730> running<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.150> at<00:00:46.300> half<00:00:46.930> choke<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:50.470> when<00:00:50.680> I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
been running it at half choke and when I

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.820 
been running it at half choke and when I
try<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.040> run<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.400> with<00:00:51.490> a<00:00:51.550> wide-open<00:00:52.740> you<00:00:53.740> know

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
try to run it with a wide-open you know

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.830 
try to run it with a wide-open you know
that<00:00:53.950> hasn't<00:00:54.280> quite<00:00:54.460> sounded<00:00:55.000> right<00:00:55.180> so

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
that hasn't quite sounded right so

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.910 
that hasn't quite sounded right so
anyway<00:00:56.080> while<00:00:56.290> I<00:00:56.320> got<00:00:56.500> it<00:00:56.590> out<00:00:56.680> I'm<00:00:56.830> gonna

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
anyway while I got it out I'm gonna

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.090 
anyway while I got it out I'm gonna
clean<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.250> all<00:00:57.370> up<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:58.590> blow<00:00:59.590> everything<00:00:59.860> out

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
sure enough the needle and the pilot jet

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.440 
sure enough the needle and the pilot jet
were<00:01:19.900> gummed<00:01:20.110> up<00:01:20.350> they<00:01:21.340> could<00:01:21.520> add<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.270> little

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
were gummed up they could add a little

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.450 
were gummed up they could add a little
bit<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.750> room<00:01:23.290> for<00:01:23.350> air<00:01:23.800> to<00:01:23.950> go<00:01:24.070> through<00:01:24.310> them

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
bit of room for air to go through them

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.510 
bit of room for air to go through them
but<00:01:24.700> not<00:01:24.880> much<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.710> cleaned<00:01:27.010> them<00:01:27.159> all<00:01:27.310> out

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
but not much so I cleaned them all out

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.240 
but not much so I cleaned them all out
and<00:01:27.729> put<00:01:27.909> them<00:01:28.000> back<00:01:28.090> together<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.570> set<00:01:28.960> them

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and put them back together and set them

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.290 
and put them back together and set them
and<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.370> thought<00:01:30.520> well<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.729> got<00:01:30.909> that<00:01:31.060> out<00:01:31.090> I'm

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
and I thought well I got that out I'm

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.550 
and I thought well I got that out I'm
gonna<00:01:31.420> try<00:01:31.540> to<00:01:31.630> get<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.870> air<00:01:32.050> box<00:01:32.260> out<00:01:32.530> of

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
gonna try to get that air box out of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.160 
gonna try to get that air box out of
there<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.729> way<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.090> was<00:01:37.240> set<00:01:37.479> up<00:01:37.510> I<00:01:37.870> was

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
there and the way that was set up I was

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.170 
there and the way that was set up I was
really<00:01:38.470> thought<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.250> was<00:01:39.370> gonna<00:01:39.549> be<00:01:39.640> hard<00:01:40.030> to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
really thought it was gonna be hard to

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.030 
really thought it was gonna be hard to
get<00:01:40.270> out<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.479> there<00:01:40.690> but<00:01:40.780> I<00:01:40.870> took<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.350> three

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
get out of there but I took the three

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.830 
get out of there but I took the three
bolts<00:01:42.280> out<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.060> fell<00:01:43.330> down<00:01:43.360> and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
bolts out of it and it fell down and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.270 
bolts out of it and it fell down and
just<00:01:43.960> came<00:01:44.200> right<00:01:44.409> out<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.770> there<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:47.280> pleased

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
just came right out of there so pleased

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.820 
just came right out of there so pleased
with<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.680> make<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.640> bracket<00:01:52.030> off<00:01:52.330> here

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
with that and make a bracket off here

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.350 
with that and make a bracket off here
see<00:01:53.830> if<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:53.950> get<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.190> inner<00:01:54.490> filter<00:01:54.880> out<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.240> it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
see if I get this inner filter out of it

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.100 
see if I get this inner filter out of it
it's<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.390> bracket<00:01:58.780> on<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.869> back

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
it's just the bracket on the back

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:09.359 
it's just the bracket on the back
unbolted<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.549> filter<00:02:06.909> just<00:02:07.030> came<00:02:07.270> out

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
unbolted and the filter just came out

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.400 
unbolted and the filter just came out
and<00:02:09.729> actually<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.450> doesn't<00:02:10.690> look<00:02:10.989> bad<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410
