the<00:01:40.010> least

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:14.170 

little<00:01:58.460> faster<00:02:11.770> anyways<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.730> my<00:02:13.760> fifth

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
little faster anyways this is my fifth

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.540 
little faster anyways this is my fifth
or<00:02:14.330> sixth<00:02:14.690> treatment<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.100> uh<00:02:18.310> yeah<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:22.370> will

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
or sixth treatment so uh yeah this will

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.870 
or sixth treatment so uh yeah this will
scab<00:02:22.819> over<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.480> it'll<00:02:23.630> heal<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.380> then

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
scab over and it'll heal and then

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.670 
scab over and it'll heal and then

more<00:02:28.010> treatments<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.890> there<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> go
