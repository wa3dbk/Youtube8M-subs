00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
what we did before and even if we would

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.340 
what we did before and even if we would

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
which it was made and if we can keep

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.499 
which it was made and if we can keep
that<00:02:07.690> experience<00:02:07.960> going<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:09.390> we're<00:02:10.390> going

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
every day it's just not going to be what

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.199 
every day it's just not going to be what
it<00:02:30.519> would<00:02:30.700> be<00:02:30.880> if<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.239> loved<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.940> when<00:02:34.120> you

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
it would be if you loved it and when you

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.400 
it would be if you loved it and when you
love<00:02:34.390> something<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.840> spend<00:02:35.140> too<00:02:35.230> much<00:02:35.350> time

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
love something you spend too much time

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.690 
love something you spend too much time
doing<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.190> spend<00:02:36.430> too<00:02:36.519> much<00:02:36.610> time

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
doing it you spend too much time

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.840 
doing it you spend too much time
thinking<00:02:36.910> about<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.769> like<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:38.920> bleeds<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.400> in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
thinking about it like it bleeds you in

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.870 
thinking about it like it bleeds you in
some<00:02:40.600> way<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.079> think<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.680> think<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.130> the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
some way but I think I think that the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.030 
some way but I think I think that the
truth<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:43.359> has<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.049> happen<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.920> it's

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
truth is that has to happen if it's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.460 
truth is that has to happen if it's
if<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.909> gonna<00:02:48.120> blow<00:02:48.540> people<00:02:48.870> away<00:02:48.959> like<00:02:49.379> if

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
if it's gonna blow people away like if

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.449 
if it's gonna blow people away like if
it's<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.920> something<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.310> really

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
it's going to be something that really

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.030 
it's going to be something that really
matters<00:02:53.629> it<00:02:54.629> hasn't<00:02:55.110> mattered<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.590> us<00:02:55.709> whether

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
matters it hasn't mattered to us whether

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.100 
matters it hasn't mattered to us whether
we<00:02:56.340> were<00:02:56.549> in<00:02:56.790> Chicago<00:02:57.180> working<00:02:57.989> together

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
we were in Chicago working together

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.530

because they can reach you in ways that

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.800 
because they can reach you in ways that
other<00:03:13.110> forms<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.709> entertainment<00:03:14.510> don't<00:03:15.510> like

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
little bit more not necessarily because

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.670 
little bit more not necessarily because
I<00:04:21.449> have<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.840> at<00:04:22.320> all

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
but because I really enjoy doing this

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.659 
but because I really enjoy doing this
kind<00:04:25.199> of<00:04:25.259> thing<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.560> mean<00:04:25.590> we<00:04:26.220> get<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.520> make

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
kind of thing I mean we get to make

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.550 
kind of thing I mean we get to make
games<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.419> it<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.169> like<00:04:29.009> being<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.460> kid<00:04:29.699> it's

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
games and it is like being a kid it's

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.920 
games and it is like being a kid it's
it's<00:04:31.560> it's<00:04:32.150> it's<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.240> privilege<00:04:33.659> this<00:04:35.840> is<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
it's it's it's a privilege this is the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.500 
it's it's it's a privilege this is the
most<00:04:37.139> ambitious<00:04:38.090> project<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.180> I've<00:04:39.300> ever

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
most ambitious project that I've ever

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.589 
most ambitious project that I've ever
ever<00:04:39.960> worked<00:04:40.289> on<00:04:40.470> with<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.760> most<00:04:42.000> people<00:04:42.360> and

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
ever worked on with the most people and

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.560 
ever worked on with the most people and
the<00:04:43.310> longest<00:04:44.310> amount<00:04:44.490> of<00:04:44.580> time<00:04:44.669> still<00:04:45.419> ahead

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
the longest amount of time still ahead

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.110 
the longest amount of time still ahead
of<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:45.930> but<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.520> still<00:04:47.520> scares<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.940> hell<00:04:48.090> I

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
of this but it still scares the hell I

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.469 
of this but it still scares the hell I
mean<00:04:48.570> that's<00:04:49.500> that's<00:04:49.830> pretty<00:04:50.070> different

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
mean that's that's pretty different

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.850 
mean that's that's pretty different
maybe<00:04:51.479> I'm<00:04:51.630> just<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:52.050> little<00:04:52.169> bit<00:04:52.349> older<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.620> so

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
maybe I'm just a little bit older and so

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860 
maybe I'm just a little bit older and so
I<00:04:52.889> know<00:04:53.070> enough<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.340> be<00:04:53.460> afraid<00:04:53.909> Halon<00:04:54.780> one

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
I know enough to be afraid Halon one

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.420 
I know enough to be afraid Halon one
seems<00:04:55.080> really<00:04:55.139> easy<00:04:55.470> in<00:04:55.680> retrospect<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:56.280> guess

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
seems really easy in retrospect I guess

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.749 
seems really easy in retrospect I guess
that's<00:04:56.580> what<00:04:56.699> I'm<00:04:56.759> saying

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759

about the next big thing that the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.299 
about the next big thing that the
bungees<00:05:02.909> working<00:05:03.270> at<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.539> I'm<00:05:03.599> like

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:04.309 
bungees working at and I'm like

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.129 
bungees working at and I'm like
well<00:05:04.819> I<00:05:04.849> don't<00:05:05.089> really<00:05:05.209> understand<00:05:05.779> it<00:05:05.929> yet

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
well I don't really understand it yet

but I'm excited because I trust the guys
who<00:05:08.689> are<00:05:08.869> excited<00:05:09.199> about<00:05:09.559> it<00:05:09.769> because<00:05:10.669> they've
