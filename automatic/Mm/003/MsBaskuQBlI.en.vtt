00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.370
 accounting for all hello face I will now 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.649
 there is such a garbage I really don't know 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.360
 what is it this mom chet bought 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.130
 put me here about when she will come 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'll ask what is then in the title of the video 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.250
 I will write 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 well so i don't have a clue 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.439
 This type is similar to some 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 casserole but you know how it smells 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.490
 smells like such a zhruchka of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.970
 mcdonalds so i just can't 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.890
 us, so zhrachka and so that is it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.180
 that's how the casserole is so here and at the same 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.500
 time is like pancakes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:49.980
 I do not know here is a shorter tomato here 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 because the egg here does not seem to mean a tomato 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:00.480
 it is still very reminiscent of pizza 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 to taste and pizza reminds and some food 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.360
 from mcdonalds i don't understand when you will 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.530
 I watch this video I already know 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530
 such a forehead name will see 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 maybe now while i don't know them so i 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.689
 I clearly do not know what it is but tasty 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.689
 by the way 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.300
 similar to pizza in general with such 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.300
 in chunks 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:46.920
 surely this is probably pizza because it tastes 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.360
 like pizza becomes but pieces 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.360
 first because this casserole 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:10.850
 I wonder that tomato is probably 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.290
 vicino 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.140
 here's a piece of ham so it's more likely 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.850
 whole pizza for making such a pizza making 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.660
 with tomatoes but candles and mozzarella cheese 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.390
 or whatever it is called yes straight very 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.680
 1 k1 seems to be 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.390
 I began to become what is this food from 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.010
 mcdonalds then there is no pizza like 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.590
 on food from mardon with it look like pizza in 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.870
 This did not hear so it seemed but now 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.310
 here I eat it yes and here I am more and 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.310
 more convinced that this is pizza after all 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.800
 such pieces for some reason I hardly know 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.050
 whether she cut it really so 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:03.769
 sold for such a serious piece 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:03.769
 incomprehensible tomato slice of ham 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.980
 delicious out of ten put eight 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.130
 probably seen normally 3 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.840
 then a little bit even so sharp on 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.840
 a little astrid 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.380
 in the title of the video you now see 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.480
 exactly what it is 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.470
 simple show no major don't know what 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.300
 this is now take off then mom will come i 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.440
 I find out what Iâ€™ll write the title of the video and 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.440
 then I will load there either 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:04:08.810
 really who crash up there so 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:12.950
 sharp little but these here 3 brackets give them 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:17.600
 it is clear yes the swords are there cheese and all that 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:39.650
 but here these pieces seem like pure 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:41.540
 casserole dogs casserole interesting even 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.050
 don't want to stop go go go and 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.110
 look 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.330
 delicious she yes you see 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.310
 mean exactly this pizza stop convenience over convenience 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.130
 tags think probably all because here 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.660
 here is a piece 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:59.240
 the attack is all watered with cheese and in this village 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:03.700

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.700

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.440
 i was like a casserole of some kind of bread 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.440
 weird for pizza 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.710
 maybe it's fat or some kind of shit like 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:39.229
 they're called 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:41.819
 She comes out to judge the judge interestingly 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:48.180
 what she decided to buy suddenly suddenly 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:50.909
 try grute very goodies and 200 more 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.780

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.710

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:34.639
