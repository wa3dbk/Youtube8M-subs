00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.540 

okay<00:00:01.589> so<00:00:01.650> what<00:00:01.979> we're<00:00:02.070> going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.429> look

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
okay so what we're going to have a look

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.780 
okay so what we're going to have a look
at<00:00:02.730> here<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.210> some<00:00:04.040> sliding<00:00:05.040> filament<00:00:05.310> theory

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
at here is some sliding filament theory

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.600 
at here is some sliding filament theory
I'm<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.750> start<00:00:07.020> out<00:00:07.170> with<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.610> resting

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I'm going to start out with the resting

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.820 
I'm going to start out with the resting
sarcomere<00:00:09.360> or<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.599> muscle<00:00:09.929> at<00:00:10.019> rest<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.559> can

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
sarcomere or the muscle at rest you can

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.410 
sarcomere or the muscle at rest you can
see<00:00:11.130> we've<00:00:11.280> got<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.580> myosin<00:00:11.820> head

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
see we've got the myosin head

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.230 
see we've got the myosin head
we've<00:00:13.170> got<00:00:13.440> ADP<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.309> phosphate<00:00:14.730> iron

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
we've got ADP and the phosphate iron

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.840 
we've got ADP and the phosphate iron
attached<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> middle<00:00:17.820> here

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
attached to it and in the middle here

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
attached to it and in the middle here
we've<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:18.480> actin<00:00:19.430> which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.760> red<00:00:21.590> balls

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
we've got actin which is the red balls

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.660 
we've got actin which is the red balls
and<00:00:22.890> we've<00:00:23.609> got<00:00:23.789> troponin<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.539> tropomyosin

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
and we've got troponin and tropomyosin

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.400 
and we've got troponin and tropomyosin
now<00:00:26.670> troponin<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.300> tropomyosin<00:00:27.410> are

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
now troponin and tropomyosin are

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.519 
now troponin and tropomyosin are
actually<00:00:28.710> wrapped<00:00:28.949> around<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.369> actin<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.720> at

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
actually wrapped around the actin and at

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.530 
actually wrapped around the actin and at
rest<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.350> troponin<00:00:34.350> active<00:00:35.190> sites<00:00:35.540> can't

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
rest the the troponin active sites can't

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.040 
rest the the troponin active sites can't
connect<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.250> myosin<00:00:38.579> heads<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.870> when

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
connect to the myosin heads so when

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
connect to the myosin heads so when
there's<00:00:40.230> no<00:00:40.320> calcium<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> cell<00:00:41.420> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
there's no calcium and the cell the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
there's no calcium and the cell the
orientation<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.290> these<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.739> active<00:00:44.040> sites

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
orientation of these little active sites

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
orientation of these little active sites
means<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> mice<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> can't<00:00:45.539> join<00:00:45.719> up

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
means that the mice and can't join up

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
means that the mice and can't join up
with<00:00:45.960> them<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.559> progress<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.950> when

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
with them and if we progress on when

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.029 
with them and if we progress on when
calcium<00:00:51.000> comes<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> cell<00:00:52.039> what

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
calcium comes into the cell what

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.939 
calcium comes into the cell what
actually<00:00:53.370> happens<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.899> sites<00:00:55.500> are

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
actually happens is that the sites are

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.670 
actually happens is that the sites are
shifted<00:00:56.730> slightly<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> myosin<00:00:58.410> can

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
shifted slightly so that the myosin can

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
shifted slightly so that the myosin can
actually<00:00:58.980> connect<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.390> mice<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
actually connect to them the mice and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
actually connect to them the mice and
heads<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> action<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> calcium

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
heads and that's the action of calcium

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
heads and that's the action of calcium
so<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> action<00:01:04.290> potential<00:01:04.769> comes<00:01:05.129> down

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so when that action potential comes down

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.880 
so when that action potential comes down
across<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.880> neuromuscular<00:01:06.479> Junction<00:01:07.080> causes

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
across the neuromuscular Junction causes

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.590 
across the neuromuscular Junction causes
calcium<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.640> released<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
calcium to be released into the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.160 
calcium to be released into the
sarcoplasmic<00:01:09.900> reticulum<00:01:11.000> then<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.750> calcium

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
sarcoplasmic reticulum then that calcium

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.700 
sarcoplasmic reticulum then that calcium
floods<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.799> muscle<00:01:14.100> cell<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.990> troponin

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
floods the muscle cell and the troponin

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.370 
floods the muscle cell and the troponin
becomes<00:01:17.130> available<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> myosin<00:01:18.150> heads

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.660 

what's<00:01:22.380> happening<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.310> those

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
what's happening now is that those

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
what's happening now is that those
myosin<00:01:24.210> heads<00:01:24.390> are<00:01:24.509> connecting<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> those

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
myosin heads are connecting to those

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.770 
myosin heads are connecting to those
active<00:01:26.040> sites<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.570> next<00:01:27.810> stage<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:29.780> what

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
active sites and the next stage is what

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.609 
active sites and the next stage is what
they<00:01:30.900> call<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> power<00:01:31.200> stroke<00:01:32.840> now<00:01:33.840> during

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
they call the power stroke now during

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
they call the power stroke now during
the<00:01:34.770> power<00:01:34.979> stroke<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.790> ADP<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the power stroke the ADP and the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.510 
the power stroke the ADP and the
phosphate<00:01:37.170> iron<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.040> sitting<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
phosphate iron that was sitting on the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.490 
phosphate iron that was sitting on the
myosin<00:01:38.700> head<00:01:38.939> are<00:01:42.049> ejected<00:01:43.049> off<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:44.360> release

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
myosin head are ejected off and release

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.399 
myosin head are ejected off and release
energy<00:01:46.500> at<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.340> time<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.720> energy<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
energy at that time and the energy is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
energy at that time and the energy is
what<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> used<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.549> actually<00:01:50.700> make<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.270> power

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
what is used to actually make that power

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.550 
what is used to actually make that power
stroke<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.979> obviously<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> looks<00:01:53.610> tiny

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
stroke and obviously this looks tiny

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.230 
stroke and obviously this looks tiny
terms<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.640> unit<00:01:56.850> doing

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
terms if it's just one little unit doing

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
terms if it's just one little unit doing
this<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.630> imagine<00:01:57.990> millions<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.590> these

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this but you imagine millions of these

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.069 
this but you imagine millions of these
things<00:01:58.799> happening<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.549> once

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
things happening at once

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.330 
things happening at once
pulling<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.560> actin<00:02:01.950> along<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.979> obviously

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
pulling the actin along and so obviously

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
pulling the actin along and so obviously
that's<00:02:05.909> how<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> that's<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.259> create<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that's how you that's here create a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.130 
that's how you that's here create a
contraction

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
contraction

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.430 
contraction
so<00:02:11.039> now<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.400> happens<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.880> ATP<00:02:12.510> comes<00:02:12.960> back<00:02:13.260> in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so now what happens as ATP comes back in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.600 
so now what happens as ATP comes back in
binds<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> myosin<00:02:14.880> head<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:16.610> then

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
binds up to the myosin head and then

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.800 
binds up to the myosin head and then
it's<00:02:17.910> hydrolyzed<00:02:18.720> which<00:02:19.410> which<00:02:20.450> puts<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
it's hydrolyzed which which puts the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.060 
it's hydrolyzed which which puts the
puts<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.440> back<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.770> an<00:02:22.890> ADP<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.550> P<00:02:23.790> state<00:02:25.070> and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
puts it back to an ADP and P state and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.680 
puts it back to an ADP and P state and
then<00:02:26.280> we're<00:02:26.460> back<00:02:26.580> at<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.850> start<00:02:27.120> here<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.570> as

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
then we're back at the start here now as

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.230 
then we're back at the start here now as
long<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.230> calcium<00:02:28.470> round<00:02:29.010> within<00:02:30.000> that

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
long as it's calcium round within that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.690 
long as it's calcium round within that
cell<00:02:30.600> those<00:02:31.380> sites<00:02:31.740> would<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:32.100> active<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
cell those sites would be active so the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
cell those sites would be active so the
cycle<00:02:33.150> would<00:02:33.270> continue<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.260> 2<00:02:34.500> 2

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
cycle would continue so the 2 2

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.280 
cycle would continue so the 2 2
qualifiers<00:02:35.160> are<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> contraction<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
qualifiers are for a contraction to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.980 
qualifiers are for a contraction to
happen<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.680> must<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.280> calcium<00:02:38.840> within<00:02:39.840> that

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
happen I must have calcium within that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.550 
happen I must have calcium within that
cell<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:41.040> must<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.520> ATP<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:43.170> come

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
cell and I must have ATP that's come

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.370 
cell and I must have ATP that's come
back<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.330> allowed<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.540> Meissen<00:02:46.050> heat<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
back in and allowed this Meissen heat to

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.949 
back in and allowed this Meissen heat to
release<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.910> hydrolyzed<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.690> ready

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
release and to be hydrolyzed and ready

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.000 
release and to be hydrolyzed and ready
to<00:02:49.020> go<00:02:49.260> again<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.560> things<00:02:52.770> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
to go again so one of the things that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.600 
to go again so one of the things that
obviously<00:02:53.130> happens<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:54.830> rigor<00:02:55.830> mortis<00:02:55.920> which

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
obviously happens is rigor mortis which

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.550 
obviously happens is rigor mortis which
has<00:02:56.790> when<00:02:56.970> someone<00:02:57.270> passes<00:02:57.720> away<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
has when someone passes away and and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.380 
has when someone passes away and and
soon<00:02:58.950> afterwards<00:02:59.459> their<00:02:59.640> muscles<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.150> quite

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
soon afterwards their muscles get quite

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.720 
soon afterwards their muscles get quite
stiff<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.800> reason<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.700> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
stiff and the reason for that is that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.070 
stiff and the reason for that is that
there's<00:03:03.000> no<00:03:03.120> supply<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.690> ATP<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:06.080> muscle

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
there's no supply of ATP so the muscle

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.490 
there's no supply of ATP so the muscle
is<00:03:07.380> bound<00:03:08.100> up<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:09.360> because<00:03:09.630> there's<00:03:09.810> no<00:03:09.870> ATP

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
is bound up and because there's no ATP

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.920 
is bound up and because there's no ATP
to<00:03:10.650> come<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.070> can't<00:03:11.310> unbind<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.750> course

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
to come in it can't unbind so of course

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.720 
to come in it can't unbind so of course
it<00:03:13.200> looks<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.130> know<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.370> person's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
it looks like it you know the person's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.190 
it looks like it you know the person's
got<00:03:14.910> contracted<00:03:15.480> muscles<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.080> they're

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
got contracted muscles and they're

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.530 
got contracted muscles and they're
actually<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.590> locked<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.269> reason

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
actually just locked and the reason

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.850 
actually just locked and the reason
they're<00:03:18.660> locked<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.110> because<00:03:19.410> these<00:03:19.590> myosin

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
they're locked is because these myosin

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.710 
they're locked is because these myosin
heads<00:03:20.280> are<00:03:20.459> bound<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> Acton's

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
heads are bound to the Acton's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.810 
heads are bound to the Acton's
and<00:03:21.870> there's<00:03:22.410> no<00:03:22.560> ATP<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.220> actually<00:03:23.519> release

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
and there's no ATP to actually release

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.500 
and there's no ATP to actually release
that<00:03:24.090> again<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.430> yeah<00:03:26.430> if<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.970> ever<00:03:27.000> wondering

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that again so yeah if you ever wondering

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.600 
that again so yeah if you ever wondering
why<00:03:27.690> our<00:03:27.739> bodies<00:03:28.739> look<00:03:28.890> terribly<00:03:29.370> unpleasant

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
why our bodies look terribly unpleasant

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.030 
why our bodies look terribly unpleasant
for<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.030> first<00:03:30.239> 2<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.380> 10<00:03:31.530> hours<00:03:31.860> after

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
for the first 2 to 10 hours after

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.660 
for the first 2 to 10 hours after
they've<00:03:32.340> passed<00:03:32.519> away<00:03:32.880> all<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.209> will<00:03:33.360> be<00:03:33.450> why
