against<00:00:18.510> El<00:00:18.660> Salvador<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.290> thought<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.680> went

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
against El Salvador I thought it went

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
against El Salvador I thought it went
all<00:00:19.890> right<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.190> think<00:00:20.510> all<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> guys<00:00:21.780> are

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
all right I think all the guys are

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.330 
all right I think all the guys are
coming<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.290> different<00:00:22.500> pre-seasons<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
coming from different pre-seasons and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.380 
coming from different pre-seasons and
different<00:00:23.580> schedules<00:00:23.940> and<00:00:24.060> stuff<00:00:24.120> like<00:00:24.330> that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
different schedules and stuff like that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630 
different schedules and stuff like that
but<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.720> thought<00:00:24.960> overall<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.890> first<00:00:26.100> day<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
but I thought overall for first day it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
but I thought overall for first day it
was<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.110> anytime<00:00:28.110> we<00:00:28.230> come<00:00:28.350> in<00:00:28.530> back

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
was all right anytime we come in back

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.190 
was all right anytime we come in back
into<00:00:29.250> these<00:00:29.340> camps<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.940> know<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.270> a<00:00:30.420> step<00:00:31.050> up

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
into these camps we know it's a step up

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.279 
into these camps we know it's a step up
from<00:00:31.410> from<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:31.980> club<00:00:32.700> team<00:00:32.910> environment<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
from from the club team environment and

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.349 
from from the club team environment and
that<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.590> games<00:00:35.100> faster<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> levels<00:00:35.969> better

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
that the games faster the levels better

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.599 
that the games faster the levels better
and<00:00:36.690> more<00:00:37.140> intense<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.739> um<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.280> takes<00:00:38.489> some

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
and more intense so um it takes some

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.639 
and more intense so um it takes some
adjusting<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.179> I<00:00:39.269> think<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.079> know<00:00:40.170> me<00:00:40.320> at

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
adjusting but I think you know me at

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.860 
adjusting but I think you know me at
least<00:00:40.859> it<00:00:41.100> first<00:00:41.999> and<00:00:42.149> foremost<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.539> put<00:00:42.749> in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
least it first and foremost we put in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.450 
least it first and foremost we put in
the<00:00:43.199> right<00:00:43.319> effort<00:00:43.530> today<00:00:43.800> things<00:00:44.309> been

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the right effort today things been

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.739 
the right effort today things been
pretty<00:00:44.640> good<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.030> day<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.569> know

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
training with sharp you know a little

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.849 
training with sharp you know a little
tough<00:00:48.629> sometimes<00:00:48.839> when<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.260> flying<00:00:49.440> from

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.219 
tough sometimes when you're flying from
across<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> country<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.999> I've<00:00:51.780> felt<00:00:51.989> great

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
across the country but I've felt great

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.930

the one game against Sweden and then it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.710

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
you know we feel like that's that's

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.750 
you know we feel like that's that's
what's<00:03:54.260> gotten<00:03:54.560> us<00:03:54.650> through<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.580> know<00:03:55.700> to

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
what's gotten us through you know to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.940 
what's gotten us through you know to
qualify<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.840> type<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.260> work<00:03:57.380> in<00:03:57.769> practice

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.690 
qualify is that type of work in practice
and<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:59.209> if<00:03:59.299> we<00:03:59.360> continue<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.989> do<00:04:00.110> that<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.320> think

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
and so if we continue to do that I think

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.670 
and so if we continue to do that I think
you<00:04:01.700> know<00:04:01.790> we<00:04:02.420> should<00:04:02.450> be<00:04:02.660> okay<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.110> be<00:04:03.170> really

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680
