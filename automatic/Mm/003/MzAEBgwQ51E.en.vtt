 in one all the elements of the stove are 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.220
 contained in this canister 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.889
 which serves as lids we 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.639
 let's open it there's a patented system for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.350
 the tank rocker 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.410
 here the tank pump is here the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.480
 supply pipe between the tank 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 the burner is steel the screw of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:41.340
 setting and the nova burner it's the same 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.960
 burns that equips the optimus nova the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 two metal supports for posing

 use 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.480
 it is recommended but not required 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.039
 to unclog the nozzle to do this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.280
 you will use the small parts 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.850
 magnetized which is here and not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.470
 just the burner on like those 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 here the leman piece will activate the little 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.380
 sprinklers that will come down to unclog 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.369
 the supply pipe 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 we will now put in 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.670
 preheating the burner it is advisable to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 check that the cap is closed properly 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.900
 the well screwed pump you are powered 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.630
 about fifteen to twenty times according to your 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.189
 volume of gas in the tank 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 the tank is about 50 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.439
 cl 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.390
 it's two-thirds full it's up to 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:39.630
 say 30 centilitres it's planned for to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:41.490
 about an hour of cooking there does not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.720
 about fifteen times we could 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.149
 let's open the tap now to 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.320
 about 5 6 seconds a little bit more 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.350
 if you use it in conditions 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350
 winter 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:03.259
 gasoline begins to flow gasoline 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.810
 starts to burn there is a felt 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.269
 preheating below that will contain 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.849
 the senses where when the open that goes 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.860
 allow a perfect preheating of the 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.880
 burner the stove aicr allows the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.920
 to cook 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.110
 very easily you can simmer 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.120
 or possibly at full power 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.510
