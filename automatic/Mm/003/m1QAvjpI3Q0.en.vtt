00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
tactics out we're showing new levels as

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.490 
tactics out we're showing new levels as
well<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.570> obviously<00:00:15.690> one<00:00:16.200> of<00:00:16.230> these<00:00:16.350> were

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
well and obviously one of these were

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.929 
well and obviously one of these were
showing<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.040> we've<00:00:17.160> never<00:00:17.310> shown<00:00:17.520> before<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
showing that we've never shown before is

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.760 
showing that we've never shown before is
our<00:00:18.360> morality<00:00:18.570> system<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.349> the<00:00:19.470> teams<00:00:19.650> were

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
our morality system so the teams were

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
our morality system so the teams were
really<00:00:20.279> hard<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.640> we've<00:00:21.180> got<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.360> system

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
really hard on this we've got a system

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.359 
really hard on this we've got a system
where<00:00:22.020> essentially<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> choices<00:00:22.950> that<00:00:23.130> you

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
where essentially the choices that you

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.530 
where essentially the choices that you
make<00:00:23.520> in<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.759> game<00:00:23.939> those<00:00:24.180> are<00:00:24.270> good<00:00:24.390> not<00:00:24.450> only

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
make in the game those are good not only

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.060 
make in the game those are good not only
could<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.899> gameplay<00:00:25.380> or<00:00:25.410> applications<00:00:25.950> but

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
could have gameplay or applications but

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.720 
could have gameplay or applications but
they're<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.430> story

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
they're going to have story

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.790 
they're going to have story
ramifications<00:00:27.390> as<00:00:27.509> well<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.259> not<00:00:28.380> fable

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
ramifications as well so it's not fable

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.409 
ramifications as well so it's not fable
we're<00:00:28.950> not<00:00:29.160> making<00:00:29.489> anything<00:00:29.700> from<00:00:30.000> anything

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
we're not making anything from anything

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.970 
we're not making anything from anything
like<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.200> essentially<00:00:31.559> what<00:00:31.649> we<00:00:31.770> want

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
like that but essentially what we want

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.200 
like that but essentially what we want
to<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.520> bake<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.910> want<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> ask

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
to do is we want to bake we want to ask

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.819 
to do is we want to bake we want to ask
the<00:00:33.360> players<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.840> make<00:00:33.870> choices<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.559> say<00:00:34.710> go

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the players to make choices to say go

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.080 
the players to make choices to say go
through<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> game<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> those<00:00:35.579> choices<00:00:35.850> are

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
through the game and those choices are

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.370 
through the game and those choices are
what's<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> make<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.720> experience<00:00:37.110> is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
what's going to make the experience is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.479 
what's going to make the experience is
well<00:00:37.590> we're<00:00:37.770> showing<00:00:37.890> weapon<00:00:38.309> customization

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
well we're showing weapon customization

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.210 
well we're showing weapon customization
today<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.270> weapon<00:00:39.660> customization<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.130> new

today so weapon customization it's a new
system<00:00:41.490> essentially<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.090> allows<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> do

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
system essentially what allows you to do

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.870 
system essentially what allows you to do
is<00:00:42.720> um<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.590> first<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.040> weapon<00:00:44.760> customization

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
is um the first one weapon customization

is um the first one weapon customization
the<00:00:45.300> first<00:00:45.480> game<00:00:45.660> people<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.260> enjoyed<00:00:46.470> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the first game people really enjoyed it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.230 
the first game people really enjoyed it
and<00:00:46.650> this<00:00:46.740> one<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.130> really<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.820> even<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
and this one it's really it's even I

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.300 
and this one it's really it's even I
it's<00:00:48.450> even<00:00:48.720> stronger<00:00:48.990> so<00:00:49.290> basically<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
it's even stronger so basically what you

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's even stronger so basically what you
can<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.490> is<00:00:50.580> you<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.730> take<00:00:50.880> any<00:00:51.090> part<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.510> any

and I'm really excited to be able to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.730 
and I'm really excited to be able to
show<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.120> essentially<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.200> tape<00:01:31.440> playing

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.810 
show it to essentially it's tape playing
off<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.070> idea<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> something<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.640> may<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
off that idea of something you may have

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.070 
off that idea of something you may have
seen<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.090> Cloverfield<00:01:33.540> where<00:01:33.930> you're

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
seen in Cloverfield where you're

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.990 
seen in Cloverfield where you're
literally<00:01:34.409> fighting<00:01:34.950> down<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.610> side<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
literally fighting down the side of a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
literally fighting down the side of a
building<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:36.930> fallen<00:01:37.320> onto

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
building that's that that's fallen onto

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
building that's that that's fallen onto
another<00:01:37.770> building<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.820> us<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.119> really

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
another building so for us it's really

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.520 
another building so for us it's really
about<00:01:39.450> putting<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> player<00:01:40.110> interesting

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
about putting the player interesting

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
about putting the player interesting

spaces giving them the opportunity make
choices<00:01:42.510> and<00:01:42.869> most<00:01:43.170> importantly<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
choices and most importantly to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.340 
choices and most importantly to
construct<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.400> co-op<00:01:45.330> tactics<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.990> moves<00:01:46.170> in

ways<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> they've<00:01:47.040> never<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.340> able<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.760> do

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
ways that they've never been able to do

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.280 
ways that they've never been able to do
that<00:01:48.060> before<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.659> really<00:01:48.810> making<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.200> an

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that before it's really making it an

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.990 
that before it's really making it an
integrated<00:01:49.920> part<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> experience<00:01:50.610> so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
integrated part of the experience so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.160 
integrated part of the experience so
we're<00:01:51.119> giving<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.630> suite<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.960> co-op

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
we're giving you this suite of co-op
