00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.830 
surveys were carried out through last
summer<00:02:41.650> which<00:02:42.160> confirmed<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.360> roof<00:02:43.630> is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
summer which confirmed that this roof is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.070 
summer which confirmed that this roof is
home<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.290> about<00:02:44.410> 30<00:02:45.010> brown<00:02:45.430> long-eared<00:02:45.670> bats

home to about 30 brown long-eared bats
using<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.200> loft<00:02:47.380> as<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.950> maternity<00:02:48.489> roost<00:02:48.850> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
using the loft as a maternity roost a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.680 
using the loft as a maternity roost a
bit<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.100> detective<00:02:51.250> work<00:02:51.610> was<00:02:51.940> needed<00:02:52.090> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
bit of detective work was needed the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.180 
bit of detective work was needed the
areas<00:02:53.110> where<00:02:53.350> there<00:02:53.590> were<00:02:53.650> lots<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.980> bat

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
areas where there were lots of bat

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.640 
areas where there were lots of bat
droppings<00:02:54.430> member<00:02:55.269> here<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> apex<00:02:56.410> was

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
droppings member here in the apex was

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.440 
droppings member here in the apex was
where<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.920> bats<00:02:57.100> were<00:02:57.280> hanging<00:02:57.580> around<00:02:57.910> but

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
where the bats were hanging around but

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.900 
where the bats were hanging around but
where<00:02:58.600> were<00:02:58.690> they<00:02:58.810> getting<00:02:59.019> in<00:02:59.760> local<00:03:00.760> bat

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
where were they getting in local bat

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.090 
where were they getting in local bat
severe<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.480> crow<00:03:01.870> located<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> entrance<00:03:02.950> to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
severe in crow located the entrance to

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.040 
severe in crow located the entrance to
the<00:03:03.160> roost<00:03:03.430> here<00:03:03.760> behind<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.510> soffit<00:03:04.840> balls

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
the roost here behind the soffit balls

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.350 
the roost here behind the soffit balls
so<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:05.980> was<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.250> vital<00:03:06.790> part<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.180> roof

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
so this was the vital part of the roof

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.690 
so this was the vital part of the roof
that<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:07.630> couldn't<00:03:08.080> sturb<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.830> we<00:03:09.519> had<00:03:09.610> to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
that we couldn't sturb and we had to

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.250 
that we couldn't sturb and we had to
protect<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.420> ensure<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.050> new

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
protect it to ensure that the new

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.470 
protect it to ensure that the new
improved<00:03:11.440> roosting<00:03:12.430> loft<00:03:12.640> was<00:03:13.150> still

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
improved roosting loft was still

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.110 
improved roosting loft was still
accessible<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.260> bats<00:03:14.730> finally<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.940> work

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
accessible to the bats finally the work

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.729 
accessible to the bats finally the work
needed<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.510> done<00:03:16.600> when<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.200> bats<00:03:17.410> were

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
needed to be done when the bats were

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.990 
needed to be done when the bats were
elsewhere

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
elsewhere

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.900 
elsewhere
with<00:03:19.180> long<00:03:19.330> in<00:03:19.510> bats<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.930> means<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> winter

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
with long in bats that means the winter

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.490 
with long in bats that means the winter
so<00:03:21.910> well<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.360> brown<00:03:22.690> long-eared<00:03:22.960> bats<00:03:23.320> have

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
so well the brown long-eared bats have

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.870 
so well the brown long-eared bats have
been<00:03:23.530> away<00:03:23.860> hibernating<00:03:24.580> through<00:03:24.760> this

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
been away hibernating through this

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120 
been away hibernating through this
bitter<00:03:25.210> winter<00:03:25.690> we<00:03:26.200> fix<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.770> hole<00:03:26.920> where<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
bitter winter we fix the hole where the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.860 
bitter winter we fix the hole where the
rain<00:03:27.250> gets<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.820> whilst<00:03:28.060> protecting<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.720> hole

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
rain gets in whilst protecting the hole

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.870 
rain gets in whilst protecting the hole
where<00:03:29.020> they<00:03:29.260> get<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.220> hopefully<00:03:30.430> next

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
where they get in so hopefully next

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.520 
where they get in so hopefully next
summer<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.600> bats<00:03:31.810> will<00:03:32.020> be<00:03:32.110> able<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.350> come

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
summer the bats will be able to come

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.230 
summer the bats will be able to come
