00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.650
 and we have with us francesco casaroli a life of battle, defense of workers 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.760
 francesco good morning 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.570
 how many common 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.269
 the situation we have seen in this service but the situation at 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.269
 precariousness particularly in the school 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.739
 it is widespread in the sense that 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.980
 10 15 20 years remains precarious in the sense that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.280
 before becoming a role 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.899
 can spend a working life 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.570
 this in the school but also in the private situation, in other words, they are 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.230
 contracts were introduced 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.059
 term 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.970
 contracts 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.480
 for rent 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.100
 all a spread of contracts 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.820
 that make that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 i'd young people in particular don't have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.429
 the fact of having a long-term contract so they are counted per month 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.890
 1 in a little bit year 3 months can work 15 days another 20 days 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.930
 all this creates a precariousness with respect to income compared to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.820
 perspectives from the family the prospects 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.950
 young girls even less young 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.250
 for 10 years now 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.160
 in our country they have been introduced also through trade union agreements 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.080
 with the confederal unions cgil gentlemen 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.720
 that destroyed the possibility of a young person and then - young of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.810
 to be able to retire as was monopoly 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.070
 and therefore 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.750
 there is an immediate income problem there is a problem. and there is a problem 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.160
 stings and pension sasuke that ip 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.080
 the kids line the kids will take maybe it's half the pension that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.330
 will take that they took their fathers the doors 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.800
 - situation is complicated plato swears of contracts the answer of the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.350
 institutions are often not fantastic 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.270
 a recent example of a brunette minister about living the endive 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.169
 we was born in the Neapolitan jalta 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.919
 very bad because when yahoo 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.489
 a person a group of people 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.849
 the teachers wanted to ask 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.520
 this situation was the answer 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.899
 this is the worst Italy the problem 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:25.859
 that the worst of Italy opens in mind if I get it from him as respect 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.529
 this episode 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:32.769
 but the problem that we have to give answers to the best Italy has 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.339
 the best Italy and the real problem is the problem of work 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.579
 know how old you can remain precarious 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.609
 all my life there 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.680
 people like I said in the school even twenty years or even all the precarious life 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.839
 where you work 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:57.050
 my son is an Italian teacher working for 2 3 months 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.369
 you are lucky precarious file 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.769
 then they dismiss him throughout the school year 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.769
 then June July August September 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.360
 receives an income though 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.510
 he also eats with that period dennett them to support the family too 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.890
 puerperium postpone a vice that you cannot lose you feel me 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.430
 another thing that interested me to understand there are no laws in italy that 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.579
 establish after a certain period of precarious sidebar hire people or yes 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.790
 they can hold me then they are there. there are laws that say that after three times 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.029
 that one does 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.810
 of forward contracts 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.419
 to be hired mouse 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.729
 What are they doing 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:43.779
 work six months you can 15 days stay at home so you always start over 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:44.749
 hit tracker 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.849
 contracts never happen because there is an interruption 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.389
 then 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.379
 of periods and therefore you always start again 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.120
 therefore, having done the favaro law of deception, it is a deception, however 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.069
 strikes, the real problem perishes 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.269
 the problem of young people, even the less young, because 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.530
 a teacher who at 50 is still precarious 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.269
 that is a problem 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.549
 who will have a reduced pension to be average pension 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.879
 I'm about the average 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.200
 on the 700 euros average say that there is what it takes 400 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.139
 because what loses 1000 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.600
 the lowering of the period provided by links 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.800
 will be around 60% per 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.770
 what we will have 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.050
 of retirees of the future between 400 and 400 euros were 400 500 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.909
 if it's okay when they resume 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.419
 and therefore 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.930
 and there is a Italy problem 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.689
 and there is a problem with 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.990
 re brain drain abroad good ones 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.650
 nooo but wanting to work precariously in our country where they go abroad 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.800
 on the other hand, they go where their age allows 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.990
 having youthful to keep him face eating everyday eats all 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.600
 days have a real family normal income 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.330
 as we had it 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.539
 and how our parents will have it 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.889
 thanks francesco for being correct broom you will come back 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.590
 for every week to tell us pieces in this world to the next 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.120
 action
