this little camera button I don't make a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
this little camera button I don't make a
little<00:00:51.449> cameras<00:00:51.780> snapshot<00:00:52.289> sound<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.949> then

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
little cameras snapshot sound and then

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
little cameras snapshot sound and then
I'll<00:00:53.399> take<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> few<00:00:53.730> seconds<00:00:54.120> depending<00:00:54.690> on

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
I'll take a few seconds depending on

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.060 
I'll take a few seconds depending on
your<00:00:55.050> internet<00:00:55.260> connection<00:00:55.410> speed<00:00:55.890> but

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
your internet connection speed but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.040 
your internet connection speed but
usually<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.489> won't<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.760> long<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
usually it won't take very long and a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.689 
usually it won't take very long and a
new<00:00:58.289> window<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.649> pop<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.190> won't<00:00:59.430> always

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
new window will pop up it won't always
