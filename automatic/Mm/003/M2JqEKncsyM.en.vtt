instrument<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.949> kind<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.340> dialectic

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
instrument this kind of dialectic

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.540 
instrument this kind of dialectic
between<00:00:42.000> composition<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
between composition and what the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.889 
between composition and what the
instruments<00:00:45.000> suggest<00:00:45.449> is<00:00:45.660> really

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
instruments suggest is really

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
instruments suggest is really
fascinating<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.620> take<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:47.010> at

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
fascinating when you take a look at

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.369 
fascinating when you take a look at
these<00:00:47.370> old<00:00:47.579> pianos<00:00:47.989> but<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:49.320> do

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
these old pianos but what do they do

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.520 
these old pianos but what do they do
differently<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> real<00:00:50.340> question<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.879> hand

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
differently is the real question at hand

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.919 
differently is the real question at hand
you'll<00:00:52.530> notice<00:00:52.859> that<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:54.329> whole<00:00:54.480> scale<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
you'll notice that the whole scale of

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.630 
you'll notice that the whole scale of
this<00:00:55.019> thing<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.350> much<00:00:55.620> much<00:00:55.890> smaller<00:00:55.949> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this thing is much much smaller it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.700 
this thing is much much smaller it's
made<00:00:57.210> almost<00:00:57.420> exclusively<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.230> wood<00:00:58.440> there's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
made almost exclusively of wood there's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.880

similar to this at the beginning of his
career<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:25.010> Beethoven<00:01:26.010> -<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.550> were

career as well Beethoven - these were

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
career as well Beethoven - these were
really<00:01:26.910> this<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.480> really<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> deluxe<00:01:28.110> piano

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
really this was really the deluxe piano

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
really this was really the deluxe piano
at<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.830> time<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.690> I<00:01:30.690> said<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> has<00:01:31.080> five

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
at the time as I said it has five

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.420 
at the time as I said it has five
octaves<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.550> keys<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:33.000> both<00:01:33.950> much<00:01:34.950> shorter

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
octaves the keys are both much shorter

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
octaves the keys are both much shorter
and<00:01:35.640> also<00:01:37.490> narrower<00:01:38.630> which<00:01:39.630> tells<00:01:40.050> us<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.260> lot

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and also narrower which tells us a lot

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.650 
and also narrower which tells us a lot
about<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.980> 18th<00:01:41.250> century<00:01:41.550> performance<00:01:42.270> style

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
about the 18th century performance style

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.240 
about the 18th century performance style
bear<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.320> mind<00:01:43.350> -<00:01:43.620> that<00:01:43.770> someone<00:01:43.980> like<00:01:44.070> Mozart

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
bear in mind - that someone like Mozart

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.320 
bear in mind - that someone like Mozart

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
really grew up playing the harpsichord

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.960 
really grew up playing the harpsichord
in<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.690> organ<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.620> this<00:01:46.830> was<00:01:47.010> not<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
keyboard technique it was all about the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.390 
keyboard technique it was all about the
refinement<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.050> finger<00:01:55.440> work<00:01:55.620> passage<00:01:56.190> work

perhaps the sort of elbow area but not

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.020 
perhaps the sort of elbow area but not

seems<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.560> me<00:03:51.709> very<00:03:51.739> clear<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.400> when<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.239> add

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
seems to me very clear that when you add

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.270 
seems to me very clear that when you add

diametrically opposed direction you've

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.100 
diametrically opposed direction you've
got<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.739> massive<00:04:01.690> conglomeration<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.810> sound

of the richest sound from these
because<00:04:31.389> it<00:04:31.509> kind<00:04:31.959> of<00:04:32.050> there's<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.379> sense<00:04:32.889> of

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
because it kind of there's a sense of

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.769 
because it kind of there's a sense of
the<00:04:33.189> sound<00:04:33.339> going<00:04:33.639> that<00:04:33.999> way<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.539> sound

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:34.779

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:41.699 
doesn't really go up and it doesn't go
out<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:38.229> much<00:04:39.539> what<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:40.659> has<00:04:40.809> the<00:04:41.229> effect<00:04:41.589> of

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:41.709 
out so much what it has the effect of

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:45.329 
out so much what it has the effect of
straight<00:04:42.550> stringing<00:04:42.969> is<00:04:43.119> to<00:04:43.599> produce<00:04:44.339> masses

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:45.339 
straight stringing is to produce masses

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:47.040 
straight stringing is to produce masses
of<00:04:45.490> clarity<00:04:45.909> in<00:04:45.939> areas<00:04:46.479> of<00:04:46.629> the<00:04:46.689> keyboard

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
of clarity in areas of the keyboard

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.290 
of clarity in areas of the keyboard
which<00:04:47.139> are<00:04:47.289> not<00:04:47.409> known<00:04:47.740> for<00:04:48.099> that<00:04:48.399> so<00:04:49.029> you<00:04:49.059> see

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
which are not known for that so you see

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.999

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
equal force because because of the

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.769 
equal force because because of the
built-in<00:05:09.279> clarity<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:09.879> transparency<00:05:10.119> of<00:05:10.569> the

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
sound think of it in a way that each of

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
these strings is a sort of individual

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.519 
these strings is a sort of individual
member<00:05:15.369> of<00:05:15.399> a<00:05:15.580> choir<00:05:15.969> and<00:05:16.300> they<00:05:17.169> have<00:05:17.259> not<00:05:17.409> been

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
member of a choir and they have not been

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.350
