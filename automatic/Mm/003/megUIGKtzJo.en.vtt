this<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.439> guy<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.520> shares<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> almost

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
this little guy but it shares the almost

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.919 
this little guy but it shares the almost
the<00:01:09.689> exact<00:01:10.049> same<00:01:10.350> pose<00:01:11.070> ability<00:01:11.579> and<00:01:11.929> the

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
the exact same pose ability and the

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.380 
the exact same pose ability and the
transformation<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> virtually<00:01:14.579> identical<00:01:14.609> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
transformation is virtually identical so

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
transformation is virtually identical so
we'll<00:01:15.929> take<00:01:16.109> this<00:01:16.229> guy<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.409> put<00:01:16.649> them<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:16.829> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
we'll take this guy and put them off to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
we'll take this guy and put them off to
the<00:01:17.100> side<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.780> have

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960

underneath<00:04:20.870> exactly<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.830> cyberverse

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
underneath exactly like the cyberverse

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.810 
underneath exactly like the cyberverse
figure<00:04:24.180> then<00:04:25.020> reach<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.620> between<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.610> legs

and<00:04:27.060> flip<00:04:27.599> up<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.840> capture<00:04:28.680> cage<00:04:28.949> and<00:04:29.659> just

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
and flip up the capture cage and just

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.600 
and flip up the capture cage and just
kind<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.840> leave<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.169> legs<00:04:31.380> down<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.099> spread

kind of leave the legs down and spread
out<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.330> then<00:04:33.840> just<00:04:33.870> fit

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
out and then just fit

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.480 
out and then just fit
with<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.860> until<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:36.300> get<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.810> arms

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
with it until you can get the arms

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.110 
with it until you can get the arms
folded<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.700> snapped<00:04:39.389> into<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.080> shoulders

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
folded and snapped into the shoulders

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.650 
folded and snapped into the shoulders
that<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.600> then<00:04:43.470> these<00:04:43.650> will<00:04:44.130> fold<00:04:45.000> in<00:04:45.450> and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
that and then these will fold in and

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.570 
that and then these will fold in and
accordion<00:04:46.500> up<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:48.330> fold<00:04:48.840> them<00:04:48.990> underneath

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
accordion up so fold them underneath

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.060 
accordion up so fold them underneath
according<00:04:50.580> them<00:04:50.700> up<00:04:50.820> snap<00:04:51.690> them<00:04:51.990> together<00:04:52.350> and

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
according them up snap them together and

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.360 
according them up snap them together and
then<00:04:53.460> bring<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.910> legs<00:04:54.419> up<00:04:54.750> into<00:04:55.230> place<00:04:55.530> and

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
then bring the legs up into place and

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.379 
then bring the legs up into place and
fold<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.790> feet<00:04:57.470> up<00:04:58.470> into<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.250> bottom<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.330> the

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
fold the feet up into the bottom of the

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.400 
fold the feet up into the bottom of the
soles<00:05:01.520> snap<00:05:02.520> these<00:05:03.389> guys<00:05:03.720> together<00:05:04.020> and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
soles snap these guys together and

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.890 
soles snap these guys together and
that's<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.090> vehicle<00:05:06.510> mode

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
that's it that's the vehicle mode

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.129 
that's it that's the vehicle mode
as<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:08.760> can<00:05:08.850> see<00:05:09.030> Prime's<00:05:09.330> vehicle<00:05:09.750> mode<00:05:09.930> is

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
as you can see Prime's vehicle mode is

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.260 
as you can see Prime's vehicle mode is
virtually<00:05:10.800> identical<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.400> his<00:05:11.790> cyberverse

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
virtually identical to his cyberverse

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.820 
virtually identical to his cyberverse
counterpart<00:05:12.900> which<00:05:13.080> I'll<00:05:13.350> show<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.530> here<00:05:13.710> in

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
counterpart which I'll show you here in

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.740 
counterpart which I'll show you here in
a<00:05:13.889> second<00:05:14.280> though<00:05:14.669> there<00:05:14.970> is<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> little<00:05:15.600> bit

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
a second though there is a little bit

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.000 
a second though there is a little bit
more<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.470> terms<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:17.010> detailing<00:05:17.520> though<00:05:18.360> I

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
more in the terms of detailing though I

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.370 
more in the terms of detailing though I
still<00:05:20.010> just<00:05:20.370> there<00:05:21.060> are<00:05:21.240> lime-green<00:05:21.660> eight

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
still just there are lime-green eight

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.680 
still just there are lime-green eight
line<00:05:22.620> green<00:05:22.889> anyway<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:23.850> here<00:05:24.330> is<00:05:24.510> the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
line green anyway so here is the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.490 
line green anyway so here is the
cyberverse<00:05:25.260> figure<00:05:25.740> as<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.340> could<00:05:26.490> see

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
cyberverse figure as you could see

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.100 
cyberverse figure as you could see
structurally<00:05:28.500> they<00:05:28.710> are<00:05:29.210> identical<00:05:30.210> it's

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
structurally they are identical it's

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.310 
structurally they are identical it's
really<00:05:31.860> really<00:05:32.400> weird<00:05:32.810> what<00:05:33.810> I<00:05:33.840> would<00:05:34.020> love<00:05:34.200> to

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
really really weird what I would love to

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.650 
really really weird what I would love to
do<00:05:34.470> is<00:05:34.710> take<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.370> color<00:05:35.729> scheme<00:05:36.090> for<00:05:36.300> this<00:05:36.419> guy

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
do is take the color scheme for this guy

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.529 
do is take the color scheme for this guy
and<00:05:36.990> paint<00:05:37.800> prime<00:05:38.040> like<00:05:38.310> that<00:05:38.520> I<00:05:38.789> just<00:05:39.360> think

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
and paint prime like that I just think

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.880 
and paint prime like that I just think
the<00:05:39.720> color<00:05:39.960> scheme<00:05:40.260> for<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.470> cyberverse

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
the color scheme for the cyberverse

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.640 
the color scheme for the cyberverse
figure<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.370> better<00:05:41.580> but<00:05:42.210> as<00:05:42.390> a<00:05:42.450> giant<00:05:43.380> blown-up

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
figure is better but as a giant blown-up

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.770 
figure is better but as a giant blown-up
cyberverse<00:05:44.310> figure<00:05:44.610> this<00:05:44.880> is<00:05:45.120> actually

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
cyberverse figure this is actually

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.140 
cyberverse figure this is actually
pretty<00:05:45.990> good<00:05:46.110> now<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:47.100> can<00:05:47.370> attach<00:05:47.610> all<00:05:48.030> of

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
pretty good now you can attach all of

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.630 
pretty good now you can attach all of
his<00:05:48.450> weapons<00:05:48.690> in<00:05:49.140> this<00:05:49.380> mode<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.919> you<00:05:50.610> can

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
his weapons in this mode and you can

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.450 
his weapons in this mode and you can
first<00:05:51.330> put<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.660> shield<00:05:51.930> up<00:05:52.200> top<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.800> then<00:05:53.280> the

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
first put the shield up top and then the

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.330 
first put the shield up top and then the
sword<00:05:53.789> and<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.419> cannons<00:05:54.930> go<00:05:55.229> on<00:05:55.470> either<00:05:55.860> side

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
sword and the cannons go on either side

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.310 
sword and the cannons go on either side
of<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:57.680> capture<00:05:58.680> cage<00:05:59.039> like<00:05:59.520> that<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.840> there

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
of the capture cage like that and there

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.890 
of the capture cage like that and there
you<00:06:01.350> go<00:06:01.740> he<00:06:02.520> looks<00:06:02.880> absolutely<00:06:03.090> ridiculous

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
you go he looks absolutely ridiculous

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.840 
you go he looks absolutely ridiculous
with<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.320> weapons<00:06:04.620> attached<00:06:05.100> though<00:06:05.340> so<00:06:05.610> I

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
with the weapons attached though so I

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.870 
with the weapons attached though so I
normally<00:06:06.419> just<00:06:06.660> leave<00:06:06.810> them<00:06:06.990> off<00:06:07.610> overall<00:06:08.610> I'm

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
normally just leave them off overall I'm

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.690 
normally just leave them off overall I'm
actually<00:06:09.289> pleasantly<00:06:10.289> surprised<00:06:10.860> this<00:06:11.340> isn't

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
actually pleasantly surprised this isn't

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.460 
actually pleasantly surprised this isn't
a<00:06:11.789> perfect<00:06:11.970> figure<00:06:12.300> by<00:06:12.600> any<00:06:12.780> stretch<00:06:13.200> of<00:06:13.289> the

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
a perfect figure by any stretch of the

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.520 
a perfect figure by any stretch of the
imagination<00:06:13.560> but<00:06:14.340> it's<00:06:14.940> a<00:06:15.090> lot<00:06:15.419> more<00:06:15.840> solid

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
imagination but it's a lot more solid

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.830 
imagination but it's a lot more solid
than<00:06:17.430> I<00:06:17.580> was<00:06:17.820> going<00:06:18.090> when<00:06:18.300> I<00:06:18.389> was<00:06:18.570> initially

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
than I was going when I was initially

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.170 
than I was going when I was initially
giving<00:06:19.289> Hasbro<00:06:19.740> credit<00:06:20.250> for<00:06:20.430> I<00:06:20.669> thought<00:06:20.940> that

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
giving Hasbro credit for I thought that

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.440 
giving Hasbro credit for I thought that
this<00:06:21.360> was<00:06:21.600> going<00:06:21.780> to<00:06:21.900> be<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.639> flopping<00:06:23.639> mess<00:06:24.120> of

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
this was going to be a flopping mess of

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.740 
this was going to be a flopping mess of
a<00:06:24.630> figure<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.260> would<00:06:25.979> be<00:06:26.220> just<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.750> disaster

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
a figure that would be just a disaster

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.610 
a figure that would be just a disaster
and<00:06:27.979> it's<00:06:28.979> turned<00:06:29.370> out<00:06:29.520> to<00:06:29.700> be<00:06:29.820> incredibly
