tutorial for blowing wind this design is

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.889 
tutorial for blowing wind this design is
stitched<00:00:05.279> by<00:00:05.520> first<00:00:05.819> coming<00:00:06.180> up<00:00:06.299> with<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.509> long

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
stitched by first coming up with a long

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.950 
stitched by first coming up with a long
wiggly<00:00:07.859> line<00:00:08.670> then<00:00:09.300> you're<00:00:09.480> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.780> create

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
wiggly line then you're going to create

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.490 
wiggly line then you're going to create
kind<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.410> teardrop<00:00:10.980> shape<00:00:11.280> at<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.179> end<00:00:12.500> go

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
kind of a teardrop shape at the end go

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.160 
kind of a teardrop shape at the end go
inside<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.309> teardrop<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.150> do<00:00:15.960> some

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
inside of that teardrop and do some

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.200 
inside of that teardrop and do some
internal<00:00:16.619> echoes<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.550> that's<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.000> stitch

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
internal echoes and that's just stitch

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.570 
internal echoes and that's just stitch
inside<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.619> create<00:00:19.949> kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.369> some

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
inside of it to create kind of some

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.870 
inside of it to create kind of some
little<00:00:21.230> teardrop<00:00:22.230> shapes<00:00:22.470> inside<00:00:22.890> you're

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
little teardrop shapes inside you're

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.330 
little teardrop shapes inside you're
then<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> stitch<00:00:25.260> outside<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
then going to stitch outside of that and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.339 
then going to stitch outside of that and
echo<00:00:26.880> stitch<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> way<00:00:27.750> back<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.230> your

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
echo stitch all the way back to your

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.849 
echo stitch all the way back to your
starting<00:00:28.740> line<00:00:29.779> then<00:00:30.779> travel<00:00:31.260> stitch<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
starting line then travel stitch and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.490 
starting line then travel stitch and
echo<00:00:32.279> again<00:00:32.550> you're<00:00:33.059> coming<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.660> around<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
echo again you're coming up around and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.830 
echo again you're coming up around and
you're<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> hit<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.370> point<00:00:36.300> where<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you're going to hit that point where the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.940 
you're going to hit that point where the
teardrop<00:00:37.440> shape<00:00:38.270> started<00:00:39.559> this<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
teardrop shape started this is a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.850 
teardrop shape started this is a
branching<00:00:41.670> design<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.469> formed

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
branching design so it kind of is formed

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.430 
branching design so it kind of is formed
by<00:00:44.030> branching<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.180> creating<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.170> teardrop

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
by branching out creating that teardrop

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.479 
by branching out creating that teardrop
filling<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.860> echoing<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.129> shape

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
filling it and then echoing that shape

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.670 
filling it and then echoing that shape
over<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> over<00:00:51.420> again<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:52.110> creates<00:00:52.500> an

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
over and over again it creates an

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.910 
over and over again it creates an
amazing<00:00:53.039> dynamic<00:00:53.850> texture<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.110> it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
amazing dynamic texture and it's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.150 
amazing dynamic texture and it's
actually<00:00:56.219> very<00:00:56.550> easy<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.270> stitch<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> biggest

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
actually very easy to stitch the biggest

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
actually very easy to stitch the biggest
thing<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> keep<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.820> mind<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.690> simply

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
thing to keep in mind is just simply

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.770 
thing to keep in mind is just simply
your<00:01:01.320> echoes<00:01:01.969> forming<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> teardrop<00:01:03.539> shape

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
your echoes forming the teardrop shape

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
your echoes forming the teardrop shape
is<00:01:03.989> quite<00:01:04.229> easy<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is quite easy and you can see here you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.570 
is quite easy and you can see here you
can<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.390> twist<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.170> Bend<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.560> around<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
can really twist and Bend that around it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
can really twist and Bend that around it
adds<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> texture<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.140> adds<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
adds to the texture and adds to the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.850 
adds to the texture and adds to the
movement<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.909> flow<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> design<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
movement and flow of the design and it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770 
movement and flow of the design and it
really<00:01:14.220> looks<00:01:14.549> gorgeous<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.600> make

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
really looks gorgeous if you can make

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950 
really looks gorgeous if you can make
those<00:01:16.049> nice<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.560> beg<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.540> echoes

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
those nice and beg and then your echoes

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
those nice and beg and then your echoes
go<00:01:19.259> around<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.030> filling<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> rest<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
go around it filling in the rest of the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.679 
go around it filling in the rest of the
space<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> hardest<00:01:24.030> thing<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
space the hardest thing about this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
space the hardest thing about this
design<00:01:25.049> will<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.530> dealing<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> weird

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
design will be dealing with the weird

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
design will be dealing with the weird
areas<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:28.259> areas<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.040> aren't<00:01:29.670> filled<00:01:30.090> with

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
areas the areas that aren't filled with

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.429 
areas the areas that aren't filled with
each<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> branching<00:01:33.030> design<00:01:33.780> you're

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
each kind of branching design you're

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
each kind of branching design you're
going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> wiggle<00:01:35.939> in

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
going to have to just kind of wiggle in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
going to have to just kind of wiggle in
there<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
there like you can see I'm just kind of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.340 
there like you can see I'm just kind of
wiggling<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> stitching<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.110> forth

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
wiggling it and stitching back and forth

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.590 
wiggling it and stitching back and forth
echoing<00:01:40.950> lines<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.640> order<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.180> fill<00:01:42.390> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
echoing lines in order to fill this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.310 
echoing lines in order to fill this
space<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.979> works<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.759> fine<00:01:45.320> you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
space and that works out just fine you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
space and that works out just fine you
just<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> keep<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.130> consistent<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
just want to keep it consistent with the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
just want to keep it consistent with the
rest<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.570> quilting<00:01:48.899> space<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> every

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
rest of your quilting space and every

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.859 
rest of your quilting space and every
once<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> while<00:01:50.939> branch<00:01:51.329> off<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
once in a while branch off in a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780 
once in a while branch off in a
different<00:01:52.049> direction<00:01:52.460> because<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.670> you've

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
different direction because if you've

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
different direction because if you've
stitched<00:01:54.030> too<00:01:54.360> many<00:01:54.540> times<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> same

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
stitched too many times in the same

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.639 
stitched too many times in the same
direction<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.040> look<00:01:56.189> kind<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.490> odd<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> now

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
direction it can look kind of odd so now

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.260 
direction it can look kind of odd so now
we're<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.310> kind<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.820> fast<00:02:00.090> forward

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
we're going to kind of fast forward

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
we're going to kind of fast forward
ahead<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.920> design<00:02:02.310> looks

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
ahead and see what this design looks

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.359 
ahead and see what this design looks
like<00:02:02.820> after<00:02:03.750> you've<00:02:03.930> filled<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.829> lot<00:02:05.100> more

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
like after you've filled in a lot more

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.869 
like after you've filled in a lot more
of<00:02:05.549> your<00:02:05.670> quilting<00:02:06.090> space<00:02:07.340> what's<00:02:08.340> really

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
of your quilting space what's really

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.699 
of your quilting space what's really
neat<00:02:09.090> about<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.509> design<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.319> can

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
neat about this design is that you can

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.160 
neat about this design is that you can
leave<00:02:11.069> those<00:02:11.489> teardrop<00:02:12.030> shapes<00:02:12.330> open<00:02:12.870> if<00:02:13.050> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
leave those teardrop shapes open if you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.710 
leave those teardrop shapes open if you
wanted<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
wanted to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.230 
wanted to
you<00:02:14.080> don't<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.800> fill<00:02:15.070> them<00:02:15.400> unless<00:02:16.180> you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
you don't have to fill them unless you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.900 
you don't have to fill them unless you
really<00:02:16.600> want<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.350> but<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.950> think<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.340> does<00:02:18.580> add<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
really want to but I think it does add a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.390 
really want to but I think it does add a
lot<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> texture<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.190> little

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
lot to the texture to have that little

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790 
lot to the texture to have that little
bit<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.760> thread<00:02:22.000> build<00:02:22.300> up<00:02:22.510> bright<00:02:22.810> where<00:02:23.110> all

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
bit of thread build up bright where all

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.940 
bit of thread build up bright where all
of<00:02:24.040> those<00:02:24.190> internal<00:02:24.670> echoes<00:02:25.090> happen<00:02:25.650> now<00:02:26.650> a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
of those internal echoes happen now a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.700 
of those internal echoes happen now a
variation<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.240> design<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.960> Poseidon's

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
variation of this design is Poseidon's

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.050 
variation of this design is Poseidon's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
water all of those are variations of

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
designs that can work similarly you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.650 
designs that can work similarly you
don't<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.740> just<00:02:53.950> do<00:02:54.100> teardrops<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.420> can

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
don't have to just do teardrops you can

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.560 
don't have to just do teardrops you can
do<00:02:55.870> circles<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.620> can<00:02:56.650> do<00:02:56.920> hearts<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.360> do

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
and the biggest thing is just kind of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.230 
and the biggest thing is just kind of
wiggling<00:03:04.900> in<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.500> filling<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.670> space<00:03:06.940> and
