but<00:03:40.239> another<00:03:40.510> thing<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.870> does<00:03:41.049> is<00:03:41.230> if<00:03:41.889> you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
but another thing it does is if you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.740 
but another thing it does is if you
happen<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.519> get<00:03:42.730> off<00:03:42.910> instead<00:03:43.720> of

having a hard plastic outer shell where
it<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.120> really<00:03:46.299> focus<00:03:46.750> energy<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.590> one<00:03:47.889> little

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
it can really focus energy in one little

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.240 
it can really focus energy in one little
spot<00:03:48.459> on<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.329> leather<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.720> where<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.739> faster

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
spot on the leather and where it faster

spot on the leather and where it faster
this<00:03:51.819> stuff<00:03:52.090> will<00:03:52.239> flatten<00:03:52.599> out<00:03:52.810> more<00:03:53.079> so<00:03:53.260> you

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
this stuff will flatten out more so you

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.710 
this stuff will flatten out more so you
have<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.500> bigger<00:03:53.980> surface<00:03:54.519> area<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.450> ground

have a bigger surface area on the ground

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.960 
have a bigger surface area on the ground
and<00:03:55.989> it's<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.170> lot<00:03:56.410> easier<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.190> suit<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:57.910> it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
and it's a lot easier on the suit so it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.030 
and it's a lot easier on the suit so it
