00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
it it's got the built-in magnet so the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
it it's got the built-in magnet so the
odd<00:01:15.030> part<00:01:15.240> screens<00:01:15.600> off<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> moment<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
odd part screens off at the moment so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
odd part screens off at the moment so
there<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.250> open<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.119> comes<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.509> close

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
there you open it and it comes on close

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160 
there you open it and it comes on close
it<00:01:19.229> gets<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.280> turns<00:01:20.580> off<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it gets about there it turns off so the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.410 
it gets about there it turns off so the
idea<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> you've<00:01:23.159> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> use<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.180> ipad
