00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
biochemical imbalance but we do know

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.490 
biochemical imbalance but we do know
from<00:00:56.160> animal<00:00:56.820> research<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> drugs

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
from animal research that the drugs

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
from animal research that the drugs
cause<00:00:59.090> biochemical<00:01:00.090> imbalances<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.899> it's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
cause biochemical imbalances so it's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
cause biochemical imbalances so it's
literally<00:01:01.410> true<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> only<00:01:02.550> known

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the ones caused by the drugs you don't

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
the ones caused by the drugs you don't
think<00:01:11.369> anybody<00:01:12.030> ever<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.780> benefits<00:01:13.290> from

think anybody ever really benefits from

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
think anybody ever really benefits from
taking<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> small<00:01:14.760> amount<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> these

taking even a small amount of these
medications<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.409> mistake<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
medications I think it's a mistake to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.210 
medications I think it's a mistake to
try<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> treat<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.299> fundamentally
