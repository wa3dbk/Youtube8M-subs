00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.610 
pretty good because obviously it's you
know<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.760> high<00:02:27.910> damaging<00:02:28.480> well<00:02:29.290> decent

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
know it's a high damaging well decent

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.290 
know it's a high damaging well decent
damaging

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
damaging

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.840 
damaging
flying-type<00:02:31.110> move<00:02:31.550> there's<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.610> thirty

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
flying-type move there's a thirty

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.400 
flying-type move there's a thirty
percent<00:02:33.180> chance<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.540> Flint<00:02:33.810> still<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.230> that's

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
percent chance of Flint still so that's

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.460 
percent chance of Flint still so that's
pretty<00:02:34.830> good<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.700> kick<00:02:35.970> pretty<00:02:36.750> decent<00:02:37.230> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
pretty good so I kick pretty decent you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.900 
pretty good so I kick pretty decent you
know<00:02:37.590> move<00:02:37.800> there's<00:02:38.040> no<00:02:38.160> stab<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.760> though

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
know move there's no stab on it though

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.030 
know move there's no stab on it though
so<00:02:39.230> seed<00:02:40.230> flare<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.650> pretty<00:02:40.830> good

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so seed flare is a pretty good

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.890 
so seed flare is a pretty good
grass-type<00:02:41.430> move<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.150> really<00:02:42.300> good<00:02:42.540> for

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
grass-type move so it's really good for

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.330 
grass-type move so it's really good for
shame<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.770> gets<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.950> little<00:02:44.040> stab

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
shame and you know it gets a little stab

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.310 
shame and you know it gets a little stab
out<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.760> too<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.390> i<00:02:45.420> think<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.810> accuracy

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
out of it too but i think the accuracy

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.950 
out of it too but i think the accuracy
is<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.500> 85<00:02:46.980> or<00:02:47.220> something<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:48.780> could

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
is like 85 or something so it's it could

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.500 
is like 85 or something so it's it could
miss<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.470> then<00:02:49.740> he<00:02:49.800> has<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.980> rest<00:02:50.250> um<00:02:50.790> now<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
miss and then he has a rest um now the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.540 
miss and then he has a rest um now the
reason<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.900> guess<00:02:52.050> rest<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:53.010> Shaymin<00:02:53.430> is

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
reason I guess rest is on the Shaymin is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.920 
reason I guess rest is on the Shaymin is
because<00:02:53.820> he's<00:02:53.970> pretty<00:02:54.300> bulky<00:02:56.300> case<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.540> pretty

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
because he's pretty bulky case is pretty

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.210 
because he's pretty bulky case is pretty
pretty<00:02:58.230> pretty<00:02:58.590> bulky<00:02:58.770> shaming<00:02:59.310> um<00:03:00.320> now<00:03:01.320> I

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
pretty pretty bulky shaming um now I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.120 
pretty pretty bulky shaming um now I
know<00:03:02.690> there<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.720> enough<00:03:04.260> alternate<00:03:04.710> form<00:03:04.950> for

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
know there is enough alternate form for

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.640 
know there is enough alternate form for
shame<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.490> knowing<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.760> sky<00:03:06.030> form<00:03:06.500> if<00:03:07.500> you

shame and knowing a sky form if you
don't<00:03:07.830> know<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> difference<00:03:08.280> between<00:03:08.580> shame

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
don't know the difference between shame

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.750 
don't know the difference between shame
and<00:03:09.540> regular<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.170> shame<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.380> sky<00:03:10.770> form<00:03:11.100> shame

and sky form is okay so regular shame in
a<00:03:15.780> little<00:03:15.990> bit<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.380> know<00:03:16.500> he's<00:03:16.680> balanced

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
a little bit you know he's balanced

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.490 
a little bit you know he's balanced
pretty<00:03:17.820> much<00:03:18.000> all<00:03:18.210> his<00:03:18.360> base<00:03:18.600> stats<00:03:18.840> or<00:03:18.990> 100<00:03:19.380> if

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
pretty much all his base stats or 100 if

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.390 
pretty much all his base stats or 100 if
you<00:03:19.560> don't<00:03:19.680> know<00:03:19.740> what<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:19.890> means<00:03:20.160> basically

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you don't know what that means basically

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000 
you don't know what that means basically
it<00:03:20.730> means<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.150> all<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:22.080> his<00:03:22.290> stats<00:03:22.710> are

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
it means that all of his stats are

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.960 
it means that all of his stats are
centered<00:03:23.610> around<00:03:23.850> an<00:03:24.570> average<00:03:25.140> standpoint

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
centered around an average standpoint

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.790 
centered around an average standpoint
there's<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.030> two-tier<00:03:27.960> system<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.620> tier

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
there's a two-tier system the tier

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.770 
there's a two-tier system the tier
system<00:03:28.980> goes<00:03:29.340> based<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.850> how<00:03:30.180> much<00:03:30.330> base

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
system goes based on how much base

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.729 
system goes based on how much base
points<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.680> pokemon<00:03:32.070> have<00:03:33.530> Caymans<00:03:34.530> are<00:03:34.650> all

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
points the pokemon have Caymans are all

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.680 
points the pokemon have Caymans are all
100<00:03:35.160> which<00:03:35.340> means<00:03:35.580> all<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.850> his<00:03:36.060> stats<00:03:36.300> peak

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
100 which means all of his stats peak

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.600 
100 which means all of his stats peak
out<00:03:36.870> at<00:03:37.080> well<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.920> exception<00:03:38.070> HP

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
out at well with the exception HP

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.979 
out at well with the exception HP
because<00:03:38.850> HP<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.300> different<00:03:39.690> from<00:03:39.780> all<00:03:39.959> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
because HP is different from all the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.030 
because HP is different from all the
other<00:03:40.170> stats<00:03:41.090> shaman's<00:03:42.090> stats<00:03:42.959> all<00:03:43.260> peak<00:03:43.860> out

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
other stats shaman's stats all peak out

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.390 
other stats shaman's stats all peak out
at<00:03:44.250> 328<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:46.410> basically<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:46.950> can<00:03:47.100> train

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
at 328 so basically you can train

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.000 
at 328 so basically you can train
anything<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.180> 320<00:03:48.959> as<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.320> see<00:03:49.500> here<00:03:49.680> Tim<00:03:49.890> in

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
anything in 320 as you see here Tim in

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.040 
anything in 320 as you see here Tim in
nature<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.550> maxes<00:03:50.910> out<00:03:51.030> at<00:03:51.090> 328<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:54.050> what's

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
with the timid nature he's more opted to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.900 
with the timid nature he's more opted to
go<00:03:57.959> towards<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.739> special<00:03:59.130> attack<00:03:59.400> which<00:03:59.670> is<00:03:59.820> why

go towards a special attack which is why
I<00:03:59.940> special<00:04:00.330> attack<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:00.810> high<00:04:01.020> at<00:04:01.590> not

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
I special attack is so high at not

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.160 
I special attack is so high at not
exactly<00:04:02.400> 328<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.680> 299<00:04:04.680> sorry<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.900> shame

and<00:04:07.350> sky<00:04:07.470> forms<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.860> little<00:04:08.040> different<00:04:08.370> shame

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
and sky forms a little different shame

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.350 
and sky forms a little different shame
and<00:04:09.120> sky<00:04:09.330> form<00:04:09.690> he's<00:04:10.410> actually<00:04:10.790> he<00:04:11.790> trades<00:04:12.150> off

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
and sky form he's actually he trades off

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.350 
and sky form he's actually he trades off
with<00:04:12.720> with<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:14.130> defense's<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.820> get<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.090> more

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
with with the defense's to get the more

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.010 
with with the defense's to get the more
attack<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.780> more<00:04:16.169> speed<00:04:16.730> I<00:04:17.930> believe<00:04:18.930> his

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
attack and more speed I believe his

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.970 
attack and more speed I believe his
speed<00:04:19.260> actually<00:04:19.590> goes<00:04:19.770> up<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.070> 3<00:04:20.370> 72<00:04:21.030> in<00:04:21.980> sky

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
speed actually goes up to 3 72 in sky

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.240 
speed actually goes up to 3 72 in sky
form<00:04:23.340> which<00:04:23.550> makes<00:04:23.790> him<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.390> quick<00:04:25.100> not<00:04:26.100> as

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
form which makes him really quick not as

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.370 
form which makes him really quick not as
fast<00:04:26.400> as<00:04:26.580> Darkrai<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.270> pretty<00:04:27.900> pretty<00:04:28.140> close

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
and just a little bit more attack power

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.210 
and just a little bit more attack power
but<00:04:31.590> he's<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.770> lot<00:04:31.890> more<00:04:32.040> fragile<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:34.220> Damon

regulars and sky forms scat forms a

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.610 
regulars and sky forms scat forms a
little<00:05:38.830> bit<00:05:38.949> more<00:05:39.099> common<00:05:39.520> because<00:05:40.259> sky<00:05:41.259> form

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
little bit more common because sky form

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.159 
little bit more common because sky form
uses<00:05:42.129> basically<00:05:42.729> he's<00:05:43.120> really<00:05:43.389> fast<00:05:43.599> although

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
uses basically he's really fast although

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.740 
uses basically he's really fast although
he's<00:05:44.289> fragile<00:05:44.500> he's<00:05:44.949> really<00:05:45.190> quick<00:05:45.400> so<00:05:46.150> I've

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
he's fragile he's really quick so I've

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.300 
he's fragile he's really quick so I've
seen<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:46.990> lot<00:05:47.050> of<00:05:47.169> people<00:05:47.409> do<00:05:47.529> air<00:05:47.710> /<00:05:47.979> with<00:05:48.190> him

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
seen a lot of people do air / with him

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.930 
seen a lot of people do air / with him
because<00:05:48.430> he<00:05:48.580> has<00:05:48.699> the<00:05:48.819> ability<00:05:48.909> Cerny<00:05:49.779> grace

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
because he has the ability Cerny grace

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.920 
because he has the ability Cerny grace
there<00:05:51.940> any<00:05:52.120> grace<00:05:52.330> is<00:05:52.690> basically<00:05:54.839> it's<00:05:55.839> an

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
there any grace is basically it's an

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.029 
there any grace is basically it's an
ability<00:05:56.139> that<00:05:56.379> doubles<00:05:57.419> your<00:05:58.800> you<00:05:59.800> know<00:05:59.919> the

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
ability that doubles your you know the

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.040 
ability that doubles your you know the
stat<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.430> chances<00:06:01.089> of<00:06:01.120> whatever<00:06:01.629> occurring

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
stat the chances of whatever occurring

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.170 
stat the chances of whatever occurring
so<00:06:02.349> regular<00:06:03.129> Shaymin<00:06:03.520> doesn't<00:06:03.789> have<00:06:03.879> that<00:06:04.060> as

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
so regular Shaymin doesn't have that as

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.700 
so regular Shaymin doesn't have that as
you<00:06:04.270> can<00:06:04.300> see<00:06:04.569> right<00:06:04.599> here<00:06:04.990> regular<00:06:05.379> Shaiman

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
you can see right here regular Shaiman

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.399 
you can see right here regular Shaiman
has<00:06:05.919> natural<00:06:06.729> cure<00:06:06.940> so<00:06:07.690> whenever<00:06:07.839> you<00:06:08.229> switch

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
has natural cure so whenever you switch

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.110 
has natural cure so whenever you switch
this<00:06:08.710> pokemon<00:06:09.190> out<00:06:09.370> like<00:06:09.639> let's<00:06:09.849> say<00:06:09.909> it's

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
this pokemon out like let's say it's

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.809 
this pokemon out like let's say it's
burned<00:06:10.680> paralyzed<00:06:11.680> toxic<00:06:12.339> or<00:06:12.490> whatever<00:06:12.699> if

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
burned paralyzed toxic or whatever if

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:14.579 
burned paralyzed toxic or whatever if
you<00:06:12.940> switch<00:06:13.150> it<00:06:13.180> out<00:06:13.389> it<00:06:13.629> will<00:06:13.719> lose<00:06:14.050> that<00:06:14.319> so

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:14.589 
you switch it out it will lose that so

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:15.899 
you switch it out it will lose that so
basically<00:06:14.889> that's<00:06:15.039> good<00:06:15.250> to<00:06:15.370> have<00:06:15.460> in<00:06:15.490> battle

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
basically that's good to have in battle

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.390 
basically that's good to have in battle
but<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:16.870> no<00:06:16.990> shame<00:06:17.199> in<00:06:17.229> sky<00:06:17.620> formats<00:06:18.069> there<00:06:18.250> any

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
but I no shame in sky formats there any

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.959 
but I no shame in sky formats there any
grace<00:06:18.610> which<00:06:18.909> doubles<00:06:19.569> the<00:06:19.900> chance<00:06:20.319> of

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
grace which doubles the chance of

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.879 
grace which doubles the chance of
statuses<00:06:21.969> or<00:06:22.509> secondary<00:06:23.050> effects<00:06:23.469> occurring

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
statuses or secondary effects occurring

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.490 
statuses or secondary effects occurring
so<00:06:24.129> like<00:06:24.279> let's<00:06:24.879> say<00:06:24.969> a<00:06:25.419> move<00:06:25.960> has<00:06:26.139> a<00:06:26.199> thirty

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
so like let's say a move has a thirty

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.019 
so like let's say a move has a thirty
percent<00:06:26.830> chance<00:06:27.009> to<00:06:27.190> make<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.339> Pokemon<00:06:27.759> flinch

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:28.029 
percent chance to make a Pokemon flinch

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:30.510 
percent chance to make a Pokemon flinch
it'll<00:06:28.479> now<00:06:28.690> be<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:28.930> 60<00:06:29.409> with<00:06:29.710> 70<00:06:30.069> grace<00:06:30.279> so

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
it'll now be a 60 with 70 grace so

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.149 
it'll now be a 60 with 70 grace so
basically<00:06:30.819> shame<00:06:31.719> and<00:06:31.960> sky<00:06:32.289> form<00:06:32.620> is<00:06:32.860> really

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 
basically shame and sky form is really

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.529 
basically shame and sky form is really
good<00:06:33.339> to<00:06:33.520> use<00:06:33.699> air<00:06:33.909> /<00:06:34.300> with<00:06:35.819> because<00:06:36.819> air<00:06:37.089> /<00:06:37.360> is

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
good to use air / with because air / is

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.850 
good to use air / with because air / is
a<00:06:37.569> thirty<00:06:37.779> percent<00:06:38.050> chance<00:06:38.259> to<00:06:38.409> make<00:06:38.589> someone

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
a thirty percent chance to make someone

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.369 
a thirty percent chance to make someone
flinch<00:06:39.099> so<00:06:39.849> that<00:06:40.029> goes<00:06:40.419> into<00:06:40.659> a<00:06:40.750> sixty<00:06:41.229> percent

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:41.379 
flinch so that goes into a sixty percent

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.409 
flinch so that goes into a sixty percent
chance<00:06:41.740> to<00:06:41.949> make<00:06:42.099> some<00:06:42.279> one<00:06:42.400> flinch<00:06:42.639> which<00:06:42.909> if

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
chance to make some one flinch which if

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.379 
chance to make some one flinch which if
you<00:06:43.629> know<00:06:43.779> the<00:06:44.250> type<00:06:45.250> or<00:06:45.580> chance<00:06:45.909> ratio<00:06:46.300> of

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
you know the type or chance ratio of

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.449 
you know the type or chance ratio of
Pokemon<00:06:46.870> if<00:06:47.020> it's<00:06:47.349> ridiculous<00:06:47.919> like<00:06:48.159> there

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:48.459 
Pokemon if it's ridiculous like there

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:50.459 
Pokemon if it's ridiculous like there
there<00:06:48.490> are<00:06:48.729> certain<00:06:49.000> moves<00:06:49.180> like<00:06:49.990> Focus<00:06:50.440> Blast

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:50.469 
there are certain moves like Focus Blast

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:53.050 
there are certain moves like Focus Blast
it's<00:06:51.099> like<00:06:51.219> seventy<00:06:51.610> percent<00:06:51.729> chance<00:06:52.060> to<00:06:52.270> hit

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
it's like seventy percent chance to hit

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.659 
it's like seventy percent chance to hit
like<00:06:53.270> never<00:06:53.480> hit<00:06:53.750> so<00:06:54.080> I<00:06:54.460> don't<00:06:55.460> know<00:06:55.520> it<00:06:55.639> just

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
like never hit so I don't know it just

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.150 
like never hit so I don't know it just
makes<00:06:55.910> no<00:06:56.000> sense<00:06:56.120> but<00:06:56.389> anyway<00:06:56.660> up<00:06:56.870> so<00:06:57.200> this<00:06:58.130> is
