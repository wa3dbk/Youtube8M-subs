begin the first thing you'll need is a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.269 
begin the first thing you'll need is a
14<00:00:19.770> inch<00:00:20.010> long<00:00:20.340> wire<00:00:21.769> with<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> round<00:00:23.100> nose

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
14 inch long wire with the round nose

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.420 
14 inch long wire with the round nose
bar<00:00:23.670> you're<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.630> be

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
bar you're going to be

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.029 
bar you're going to be
bending<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.570> end<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.140> wire<00:00:28.380> leaving

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
bending the end of the wire leaving

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.200 
bending the end of the wire leaving
about<00:00:29.160> an<00:00:29.610> inch<00:00:29.880> extra<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.369> open<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.730> into

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
about an inch extra and you open it into

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.380 
about an inch extra and you open it into
a<00:00:33.480> loop<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.079> looks<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:35.180> I'll<00:00:36.180> give

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
a loop that looks like this I'll give

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.630 
a loop that looks like this I'll give
you<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> closer<00:00:36.840> look<00:00:38.840> here<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.079> is

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
you a closer look here it is

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.210 
you a closer look here it is
and<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> considered<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.080> petal<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.890> we

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
and this is considered one petal so we

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.920 
and this is considered one petal so we
have<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.580> petal<00:00:44.879> down<00:00:45.030> when<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.449> forward<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
have one petal down when you forward to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.860 
have one petal down when you forward to
go<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:47.580> you<00:00:47.760> you're<00:00:48.269> going<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.629> create

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
go and you you're going to create

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600 
go and you you're going to create
another<00:00:48.960> petal<00:00:49.410> by<00:00:49.559> placing<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> wire

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
another petal by placing the wire

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.560 
another petal by placing the wire
between<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.900> fire<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.670> just<00:00:53.670> wrapping<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
between the fire and just wrapping the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.310 
between the fire and just wrapping the
wire<00:00:54.600> around<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
wire around like that

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.180 
wire around like that
that's<00:00:58.320> another<00:00:58.619> petal

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.540 

and<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:02.700> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.880> continue<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.420> get

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
and you're going to continue to get

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.130 
and you're going to continue to get
three<00:01:05.550> more<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.790> wrap<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.300> around<00:01:09.450> like

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
three more so just wrap it around like

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.200 
three more so just wrap it around like
that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.480 

and<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.690> will<00:01:19.990> show<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.230> this<00:01:20.650> next<00:01:20.890> one's<00:01:21.220> for

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
and I will show you this next one's for

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:32.200 
and I will show you this next one's for
motion

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:45.030 

and<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.260> will<00:01:33.440> be<00:01:33.560> our<00:01:33.740> last<00:01:34.220> petal

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.700 

now<00:01:45.580> with<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.510> longer<00:01:46.870> wire<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.250> will<00:01:48.490> be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
now with a longer wire I will be

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.070 
now with a longer wire I will be
placement<00:01:50.710> between<00:01:51.550> these<00:01:51.850> two<00:01:52.090> petals<00:01:52.300> and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
placement between these two petals and

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.849 
placement between these two petals and
I'm<00:01:53.650> just<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.130> pin<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.460> down

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:05.800 

right<00:01:58.859> back<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.399> secure<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.179> flower

and I'll be wrapping around twice just

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.270 
and I'll be wrapping around twice just
to<00:02:24.980> make<00:02:25.220> sure<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.120> rain<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:27.280> strong

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.800 

after<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.670> wrap<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:33.880> twice<00:02:34.180> you're<00:02:34.630> gonna

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
after you wrap it twice you're gonna

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.610 
after you wrap it twice you're gonna
remove<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.470> moving<00:02:36.190> office<00:02:36.790> order

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.100 

I'll<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.370> bending<00:02:41.819> both<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.269> wires<00:02:42.480> down<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
I'll be bending both the wires down to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.580 
I'll be bending both the wires down to
the<00:02:43.230> end<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> base<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.790> ring<00:02:45.000> base<00:02:45.209> and

cutting<00:02:46.590> any<00:02:47.010> remaining

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.479 

like<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.790> after<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.749> I'll<00:02:53.560> be<00:02:53.620> slightly

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
like so and after that I'll be slightly

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.489 
like so and after that I'll be slightly
bending<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.299> wire<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.049> can<00:02:56.200> push<00:02:56.379> it

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:56.499 
bending the wire so that I can push it

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.429 
bending the wire so that I can push it
through<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.709> hole<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.959> one<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.200> wire

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
through the hole and one of the wire

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.830 
through the hole and one of the wire
will<00:02:59.709> be<00:02:59.829> going<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.790> left<00:03:01.030> side<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.659> the

will be going to the left side of the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.209 
will be going to the left side of the
main<00:03:02.019> base<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.769> other<00:03:02.920> one<00:03:03.099> will<00:03:03.189> be

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
main base and the other one will be

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.759 
main base and the other one will be
going<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.700> right<00:03:03.909> side<00:03:04.150> for<00:03:04.329> a<00:03:04.420> base<00:03:04.659> but<00:03:05.620> I

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
going to the right side for a base but I

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.129 
going to the right side for a base but I
will<00:03:06.129> wrap<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.579> wires<00:03:06.790> until<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.299> run<00:03:07.540> out<00:03:07.599> on

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
will wrap the wires until I run out on

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:16.860 
will wrap the wires until I run out on
each<00:03:08.319> side<00:03:13.920> once<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.250> does<00:03:15.519> I<00:03:15.939> will<00:03:16.540> switch<00:03:16.840> you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
each side once it does I will switch you

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.409 
each side once it does I will switch you
want<00:03:17.379> my<00:03:17.530> round<00:03:18.159> nose<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:18.969> flat<00:03:19.180> nose

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
want my round nose to the flat nose

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.289 
want my round nose to the flat nose

wire<00:03:22.510> place<00:03:23.099> so<00:03:24.099> that<00:03:24.280> doesn't<00:03:24.430> scratch<00:03:24.790> my

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
wire place so that doesn't scratch my

and I'm just wrapping the wire

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.590 
and I'm just wrapping the wire
underneath<00:05:21.570> a<00:05:22.080> pedal<00:05:22.830> like<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.270> other

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
underneath a pedal like in the other

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.290 
underneath a pedal like in the other
ring<00:05:24.900> that<00:05:25.080> I<00:05:25.139> showed<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.620> guys<00:05:28.940> want<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.120> go

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
ring that I showed you guys want to go

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.400 
ring that I showed you guys want to go
your<00:05:30.479> cylinder

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
your cylinder

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.240 
your cylinder
finger-sized<00:05:33.410> life<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:35.440> also<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:37.040> right

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
finger-sized life and also the right

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.600 
finger-sized life and also the right
there<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:38.030> we're<00:05:38.930> making<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:39.350> ring<00:05:39.530> base<00:05:39.800> so

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
there and we're making the ring base so

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:49.260 
there and we're making the ring base so
I'm<00:05:40.700> just<00:05:40.880> going<00:05:41.030> to<00:05:41.120> wrap<00:05:41.360> it<00:05:41.540> twice

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.540 

now<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:50.330> can<00:05:50.540> remove<00:05:50.690> it<00:05:51.020> after<00:05:51.350> you<00:05:51.650> create

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
now you can remove it after you create

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.180 
now you can remove it after you create
the<00:05:52.700> rain<00:05:52.880> base

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.420 

at<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:56.850> time<00:05:57.090> instead<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.750> doing<00:05:58.260> like<00:05:59.160> the

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
at this time instead of doing like the

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.400 
at this time instead of doing like the
other<00:05:59.550> way<00:05:59.760> I'm<00:06:00.000> just<00:06:00.030> wrapping<00:06:00.540> around<00:06:00.810> with

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
other way I'm just wrapping around with

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:09.699 
other way I'm just wrapping around with
me<00:06:01.590> quickly<00:06:02.070> like<00:06:02.430> this

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:09.709 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:14.600 

the<00:06:10.709> back<00:06:10.919> mix<00:06:11.189> might<00:06:11.899> take<00:06:12.899> out<00:06:13.079> my<00:06:13.579> flat<00:06:14.579> nose

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
the back mix might take out my flat nose

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.249 
the back mix might take out my flat nose
are<00:06:15.269> ya<00:06:16.019> tying<00:06:16.559> any<00:06:17.189> ends<00:06:18.089> of<00:06:18.329> the<00:06:18.599> wire<00:06:18.809> so

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
are ya tying any ends of the wire so

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:29.120 
are ya tying any ends of the wire so
that<00:06:19.289> doesn't<00:06:19.679> scratch<00:06:20.039> my<00:06:20.249> fingers<00:06:20.639> again

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:38.240
