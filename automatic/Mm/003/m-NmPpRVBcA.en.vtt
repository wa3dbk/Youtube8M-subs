00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
back the way it used to be there we go I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.360 
back the way it used to be there we go I
believe<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.590> something<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.310> you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
believe was something like that and you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.250 
believe was something like that and you
right<00:02:38.640> click<00:02:38.670> onto<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> skin<00:02:39.360> color<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.780> then

right click onto the skin color and then

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.750 
right click onto the skin color and then
make<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.590> back<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.069> way<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.370> was<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.730> I

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
make it back to the way it was so I

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.130 
make it back to the way it was so I
could<00:02:41.849> see<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:42.360> very<00:02:42.390> easy<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.989> very

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
could see it's very easy and very

could see it's very easy and very
seamless<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.950> paint<00:02:44.760> using<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.239> um<00:02:45.709> using

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.960 
basically anything so well you can't
really<00:04:21.870> go<00:04:22.049> up<00:04:22.080> into<00:04:22.590> an<00:04:22.770> infinite<00:04:23.550> level<00:04:23.789> but

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
really go up into an infinite level but

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.460 
really go up into an infinite level but
there's<00:04:24.150> like<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.300> limit<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.840> believe<00:04:24.930> it's

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
there's like a limit I believe it's

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.960 
there's like a limit I believe it's
about<00:04:25.650> well<00:04:25.979> let's<00:04:26.099> say<00:04:26.190> 1/2

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
about well let's say 1/2

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.790 
about well let's say 1/2
three<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:27.990> can<00:04:28.110> build<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.440> quite<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> bit

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
three so you can build it quite a bit

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.230 
three so you can build it quite a bit
above<00:04:29.100> its<00:04:29.280> head<00:04:29.340> as<00:04:29.580> well<00:04:29.730> as<00:04:29.790> quite<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.060> bit

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
above its head as well as quite a bit

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.610 
above its head as well as quite a bit
around<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.570> body<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:31.320> not<00:04:31.410> really

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
around this body it's not really

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.320 
around this body it's not really
infinite<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.550> mean<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:32.940> does<00:04:33.000> give<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
infinite so I mean it does give you a

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330 
infinite so I mean it does give you a
lot<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.540> room<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.750> add<00:04:33.930> creativity<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.800> once

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
lot of room to add creativity and once

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.430 
lot of room to add creativity and once
you<00:04:35.430> have<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.640> mod<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.360> or<00:04:36.870> installed<00:04:37.200> into

you have the mod on or installed into
your<00:04:37.560> Forge<00:04:37.830> this<00:04:38.250> will<00:04:38.430> all<00:04:38.580> be<00:04:38.790> seen<00:04:39.090> once

you've<00:04:39.570> extracted<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.620> done<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:41.250> let

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
you've extracted it and done that so let

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.190 
you've extracted it and done that so let
me<00:04:41.760> show<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:41.940> guys<00:04:42.060> how<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.300> extract<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.990> now

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
me show you guys how to extract this now

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.960 
me show you guys how to extract this now
let's<00:04:43.740> just<00:04:43.830> go<00:04:43.920> on<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.160> different<00:04:44.580> parts<00:04:44.880> of

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
let's just go on to different parts of

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.910 
let's just go on to different parts of
body<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.390> what<00:04:45.750> not<00:04:45.930> show<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.290> guys<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.770> can

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
body and what not show you guys you can

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.220 
body and what not show you guys you can
do<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.640> can<00:04:47.850> like<00:04:48.060> remove<00:04:48.510> blocks<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.050> paint

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
do you can like remove blocks and paint

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.420 
do you can like remove blocks and paint
blocks<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:49.950> do<00:04:50.010> all<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.250> cool

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
blocks and you can do all that cool

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.730 
blocks and you can do all that cool
stuff<00:04:50.810> individually<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:51.960> you're<00:04:52.410> basically

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
stuff individually so you're basically

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.310 
stuff individually so you're basically
using<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.400> three<00:04:53.970> dimensional<00:04:54.480> space<00:04:54.780> to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
using a three dimensional space to

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.590 
using a three dimensional space to
create<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.620> two<00:04:55.740> dimensional<00:04:56.310> skin<00:04:56.640> that<00:04:57.180> will

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
create a two dimensional skin that will

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.900 
create a two dimensional skin that will
just<00:04:57.840> look<00:04:57.960> absolutely<00:04:58.370> insane<00:04:59.370> once<00:04:59.760> you've

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
just look absolutely insane once you've

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.820 
just look absolutely insane once you've
extracted<00:05:00.180> okay<00:05:00.720> so<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.990> program<00:05:01.350> crash<00:05:01.650> for

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
extracted okay so the program crash for

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.900 
extracted okay so the program crash for
me<00:05:01.920> but<00:05:02.040> I'll<00:05:02.130> be<00:05:02.220> showing<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.460> guys<00:05:02.580> how<00:05:02.640> to

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910
