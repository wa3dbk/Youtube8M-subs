00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
talking about the iphone 4s what we all

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.660 
talking about the iphone 4s what we all
been<00:02:48.690> waiting<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.860> iphone<00:02:50.100> 4s<00:02:50.459> right

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
been waiting for the iphone 4s right

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.240 
been waiting for the iphone 4s right
from<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.940> name<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.420> knew<00:02:51.600> what<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.020> was<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:53.100> was

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
from the name we knew what it was it was

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.500 
from the name we knew what it was it was
basically<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> faster

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
basically just going to be a faster

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.680 
basically just going to be a faster

version of the current iphone 4 and
that's<00:02:57.690> pretty<00:02:57.990> much<00:02:58.110> what<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.340> has

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
that's pretty much what it is it now has

better when you're taking pictures on
the<00:04:04.170> iphone<00:04:04.470> 4s<00:04:05.480> another<00:04:06.480> thing<00:04:06.630> they<00:04:06.750> talked

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
the iphone 4s another thing they talked

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.560 
the iphone 4s another thing they talked
heavily<00:04:07.410> about<00:04:07.560> was<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.190> 1080p<00:04:08.790> HD<00:04:09.450> video

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
heavily about was the 1080p HD video

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.750 
heavily about was the 1080p HD video
recording<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.650> current<00:04:10.920> iphone<00:04:11.190> 4<00:04:11.400> only<00:04:11.610> has

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
recording the current iphone 4 only has

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.990 
recording the current iphone 4 only has
720p<00:04:12.690> HD<00:04:13.200> video<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:14.100> this<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.370> one<00:04:14.580> step<00:04:14.820> above

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
720p HD video so this is one step above

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.060 
720p HD video so this is one step above
it<00:04:15.540> also<00:04:15.750> has<00:04:15.900> some<00:04:16.019> pretty<00:04:16.169> good<00:04:16.350> video<00:04:16.620> image

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
it also has some pretty good video image

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.440 
it also has some pretty good video image
stabilization<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.180> you're<00:04:18.299> walking

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
stabilization so if you're walking

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.000 
stabilization so if you're walking
around<00:04:18.690> taking<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.169> video<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.799> going<00:04:19.950> to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
around taking a video it's going to

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.250 
around taking a video it's going to
stabilize<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:20.970> not<00:04:21.090> as<00:04:21.299> shaky<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:22.049> it

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
stabilize it so it's not as shaky and it

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.630 
stabilize it so it's not as shaky and it
also<00:04:22.410> has<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.710> little<00:04:23.039> bit<00:04:23.160> better<00:04:23.250> than<00:04:23.430> oyes

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
also has a little bit better than oyes

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.940 
also has a little bit better than oyes
reduction<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:25.020> wind<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.410> background<00:04:25.800> noise

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
reduction so wind and background noise

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.840 
reduction so wind and background noise
aren't<00:04:26.370> as

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
aren't as

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.780 
aren't as
affecting<00:04:27.330> your<00:04:27.420> video<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:29.370> course<00:04:29.580> the

affecting your video and of course the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.090 
affecting your video and of course the
biggest<00:04:30.180> thing<00:04:30.450> probably<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.500> selling<00:04:31.860> point

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
biggest thing probably the selling point

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.480 
biggest thing probably the selling point
for<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.430> iphone<00:04:32.760> 4s<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.540> Siri<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.710> Siri<00:04:35.280> is

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
for the iphone 4s is Siri and Siri is

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.930 
for the iphone 4s is Siri and Siri is
basically<00:04:36.620> probably<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:38.010> most<00:04:38.190> advanced

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
basically probably the most advanced

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.930
