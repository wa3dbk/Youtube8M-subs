00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.580
 I was challenged in your 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.770
 matches it's the near presence 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 systematic of this sentence two mates 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 make friends in the world of pictures 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.930
 shared would you have a seabass opinion 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.910
 of our community 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.199
 would you have this vision of the photographer 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.149
 who stays in his corner and who does not want 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.100
 especially nothing to reveal of his practice of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.140
 afraid that a competitor or rather a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.680
 opponent steals his secret his 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 customer base 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.620
 it is commonly accepted that the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.180
 photographer likes to define himself as a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 island his studio 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.559
 his shop is a sacred domain and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.719
 especially close to any other photographer 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 my friend but you have to understand them 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.180
 to be a photographer and a profession 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.539
 exception to this bygone time when taking 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.680
 a picture of mandela chavin film 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.539
 to wait before seeing the result is 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.239
 that the material was out of reach of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.290
 the worker's stock exchange being a photographer 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.150
 professional you mean we 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.680
 was part of an elite the new 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
 generation high to the internet and to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 digital did not arrange their affairs 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.430
 the least loving person to photograph 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.470
 everything and anything that is 90% 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 of us think they can 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.479
 to make some money by realizing 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.600
 marriages this hope to live from our 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.600
 passion 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.780
 to be a photographer is to be cool 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.340
 a study this activity is part of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 ten trades preferred French 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.450
 and yes those same french who is pointing 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 as soon as you want to take pictures of them 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.390
 to believe that they want to be a photographer 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.070
 only to be able to hide from 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.630
 their cameras the photographers 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.340
 professionals in 6th generation seen 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.960
 disembark hundreds and even 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.119
 thousands of people with a SLR to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.119
 their neck coming stealing their work 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.729
 and as many of his elders do 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.710
 was already not very beautiful pictures 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.860
 many again have them very quickly 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.299
 exceeded the status of auto entrepreneur 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.820
 the price of the material become very 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.280
 affordable editing accessible to all 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.920
 their facilities enormously the task 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.360
 so we could think that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.179
 new generation would be more conducive 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.800
 to these exchanges to know that my name the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.209
 most have reproduced the pattern of their 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.410
 elders see a new stylus 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.330
 arriving as competitors without 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.760
 legitimacy that absolutely must be depressed 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.349
 and thus carrying out shazam reports 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 exhibitors on their website 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.980
 failing a store with pinion on 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.540
 street wedding photos with 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.709
 plotters change these people 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.360
 intolerant to the newcomer 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.250
 it's inevitably the others that can not 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.310
 not be me that can not be you 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.600
 we look at it 36 ​​15 24 we like it 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.209
 gone to the day there to help each other 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.590
 but have you never sent a small 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.970
 young person asking for fear info 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.590
 that it will become a better day and 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.750
 which stings your customers if 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.890
 Hardly acquired in do you ever 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.030
 seen from a bad eye this new 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.010
 photographer who launches into your 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.330
 city game there you know happened more 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.930
 of one time despite the fact that I'm at 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.790
 this show 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.959
 but how can we push back this 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.650
 new competition which is not in 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.330
 does not make a 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.100
 while we make ourselves part 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.630
 of these digital photographers and do not 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.069
 do not worry about selecting this 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.540
 new wave is naturally 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.640
 there are those who want to stop because the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.110
 passion was not or those who did not 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.549
 not at all the commercial fiber and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.140
 will not be able to make money with 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.700
 their activities and of course those who 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.989
 are just bad 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.390
 facing this flood of young photographers 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.640
 gifted there is only one thing to do 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.560
 not fight against my fight with 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.359
 if laminated to not others but we 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.410
 we are not stronger 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.510
 many that all alone 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.850
 our biggest barrier is we 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.090
 our greatest asset is also 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.350
 we're your greatest at all and you 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.730
 do you differentiate from others they spend 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.739
 minus 6 from competitor status to that 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.570
 of confreres if everyone produces a 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.459
 unique work of his own 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.769
 there can be no more fear than 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.450
 the other steals your work because the photo 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.370
 is above all a matter of emotion and 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.900
 our style will never be the favorite of 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.430
 all customers in this specific context 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.650
 we can start sharing our 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.150
 tricks us this technical niche without 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.650
 afraid to be copied and the copy is not 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.000
 never as good as the original but 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.810
 so we can all evolved into the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.640
 same direction 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.010
 to make our two best photographers 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.549
 we make a living with what we receive 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.880
 but we built it with what we give 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.880
 wiston churchill 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.880
 we 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.319
 jayen second follow up there I do not want 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.670
 write and the one that went was created by 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.480
 our flash is going to do something like 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.690
 that we can use in this world have 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.690
 a circle
