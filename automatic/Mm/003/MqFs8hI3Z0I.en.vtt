would that in from the back a bit of an

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.900 
would that in from the back a bit of an
angle<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.100> sits<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:46.850> it's<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
angle so it sits up a little bit it's a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.740

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.850 
sort of aspiring to get one a bit like
that<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> I'm<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.350> make<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> door<00:01:07.710> up

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that so I'm going to make the door up

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.480 
that so I'm going to make the door up
separately<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> bead<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> weld<00:01:10.490> all

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
separately and put a bead of weld all

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.050 
separately and put a bead of weld all
the<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:11.790> around<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> outside<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.729> then<00:01:14.729> make

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the way around the outside and then make

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719 
the way around the outside and then make
up<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.450> quarter-inch<00:01:16.009> plate<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> top<00:01:17.490> with

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
up a quarter-inch plate on the top with

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.590 
up a quarter-inch plate on the top with
a<00:01:17.790> flange<00:01:18.180> around<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> top<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.420> come

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
a flange around here so the top can come

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.350 
a flange around here so the top can come
on<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> off<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.900> I<00:01:24.900> found<00:01:25.140> someone<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.650> get

a hobby and I'll sanded that down with

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
a hobby and I'll sanded that down with
the<00:02:02.430> angle<00:02:02.670> grinder<00:02:05.119> I'm<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> weld<00:02:06.600> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780

that's a good as I suppose I'm going to
shamelessly<00:02:31.680> copy<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.250> idea<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.820> using<00:02:33.090> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
shamelessly copy the idea of using a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.910 
shamelessly copy the idea of using a
Pyrex<00:02:33.720> Bowl<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.880> door<00:02:36.470> because<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.740> was

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
Pyrex Bowl as the door because that was

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.430 
Pyrex Bowl as the door because that was
a<00:02:38.390> stroke<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.450> genius<00:02:42.050> now<00:02:43.050> i'm<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.320> have

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
a stroke of genius now i'm going to have

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.280 
a stroke of genius now i'm going to have
legs<00:02:44.180> eventually<00:02:45.180> cut<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.510> off<00:02:45.750> i'm<00:02:46.110> going

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
legs eventually cut this off i'm going

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.010 
legs eventually cut this off i'm going
to<00:02:46.350> keep<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.740> there<00:02:46.860> now<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.960> so<00:02:48.960> it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
to keep it on there now so I so it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.840 
to keep it on there now so I so it
doesn't<00:02:49.260> fall<00:02:49.380> over<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:50.460> gonna<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.700> some

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
doesn't fall over so I'm gonna have some

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.710 
doesn't fall over so I'm gonna have some
legs<00:02:51.650> world<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.920> maybe<00:02:53.790> three<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.330> tripod

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
legs world is maybe three like a tripod

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.370 
legs world is maybe three like a tripod
off<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.770> side<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.910> underneath<00:02:57.380> to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
off the side here and underneath to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.220 
off the side here and underneath to
collect<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.710> ash<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.450> didn't<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.600> my<00:03:00.810> toy<00:03:00.990> on

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
collect the ash I didn't go to my toy on

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.280 
collect the ash I didn't go to my toy on
the<00:03:01.380> try<00:03:02.100> idea<00:03:02.490> not<00:03:03.150> because<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.630> didn't<00:03:04.170> think

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the try idea not because I didn't think

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.620 
the try idea not because I didn't think
it<00:03:04.470> was<00:03:04.560> good<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.370> think<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.480> little

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
it was good but I think it's a little

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.220 
it was good but I think it's a little
too<00:03:06.810> complicated<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.650> very<00:03:09.170> difficult<00:03:10.170> to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
too complicated and very difficult to

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.040 
too complicated and very difficult to
make<00:03:10.350> airtight<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.820> I'm<00:03:12.600> going<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:13.020> for<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
make airtight so I'm going to go for a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.870 
make airtight so I'm going to go for a
four-inch<00:03:16.050> hole<00:03:16.290> cutting<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.770> bottom<00:03:17.040> with

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
four-inch hole cutting the bottom with

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.150 
four-inch hole cutting the bottom with
water<00:03:18.810> main<00:03:19.110> fittings<00:03:19.530> there's<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:19.980> four

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
water main fittings there's the four

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.680 
water main fittings there's the four
inch<00:03:20.340> water<00:03:20.520> main<00:03:20.640> fittings<00:03:21.710> threaded<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:24.660> I

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
inch water main fittings threaded so I

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.290 
inch water main fittings threaded so I
could<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.050> cap<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.620> screws<00:03:29.120> off<00:03:30.440> and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
could have a cap that screws off and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.490 
could have a cap that screws off and
release<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.480> ash<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.780> way<00:03:33.960> from<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.230> bottom

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
release the ash that way from the bottom

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.660 
release the ash that way from the bottom
so<00:03:34.770> it's<00:03:34.890> going<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.070> take<00:03:35.130> out<00:03:35.340> about<00:03:35.430> three

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
so it's going to take out about three

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.730 
so it's going to take out about three
inches<00:03:35.970> at<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.180> bottom<00:03:36.480> there<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.470> then<00:03:37.620> you

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
inches at the bottom there and then you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.260 
inches at the bottom there and then you
stick<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.100> little<00:03:38.220> tray<00:03:38.490> under<00:03:38.700> there<00:03:38.850> unscrew

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
stick a little tray under there unscrew

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.150 
stick a little tray under there unscrew
the<00:03:39.390> cap<00:03:39.570> empty<00:03:40.410> your<00:03:40.440> ashes<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.920> screw<00:03:41.100> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
the cap empty your ashes and screw it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.250 
the cap empty your ashes and screw it
back<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.670> keep<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.910> airtight<00:03:42.260> they

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
back on to keep it airtight they

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.660 
back on to keep it airtight they
probably<00:03:43.440> look<00:03:43.800> as<00:03:43.980> good<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:45.000> i<00:03:46.550> think<00:03:47.550> i'll

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
probably look as good but i think i'll

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.610 
probably look as good but i think i'll
be<00:03:47.790> able<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.000> control<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.450> air<00:03:48.600> getting<00:03:49.410> into

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
be able to control the air getting into

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.460 
be able to control the air getting into
a<00:03:49.740> little<00:03:49.950> bit<00:03:50.130> better<00:03:50.220> than<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:52.260> maybe

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
a little bit better than and then maybe

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.330 
a little bit better than and then maybe
have<00:03:52.940> some<00:03:53.940> sort<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.240> gate<00:03:55.230> valve<00:03:55.500> here<00:03:55.890> and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
have some sort of gate valve here and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.030 
have some sort of gate valve here and
maybe<00:03:56.880> another<00:03:57.870> one<00:03:58.230> further<00:03:58.500> back<00:03:58.800> at<00:03:58.950> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
maybe another one further back at the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.120 
maybe another one further back at the
size<00:03:59.250> get<00:03:59.850> air<00:04:00.060> at<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.300> front<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.660> back<00:04:01.130> i'm

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
size get air at the front and back i'm

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.520 
size get air at the front and back i'm
not<00:04:02.250> really<00:04:02.400> sure<00:04:02.490> I'm<00:04:02.970> not<00:04:03.350> don't<00:04:04.350> really

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
not really sure I'm not don't really

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.470 
not really sure I'm not don't really
know<00:04:04.620> how<00:04:04.650> that's<00:04:04.950> going<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.100> work<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:05.670> that's

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
know how that's going to work but that's

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.880 
know how that's going to work but that's
what<00:04:06.540> I'm<00:04:06.660> thinking<00:04:06.930> easing<00:04:07.290> branch<00:04:07.650> gate

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
what I'm thinking easing branch gate

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.920 
what I'm thinking easing branch gate
valves<00:04:09.110> screw<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.140> into<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.500> piece<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.400> steel

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
valves screw it into a piece of steel

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.340 
valves screw it into a piece of steel
pipe<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.980> welded<00:04:14.370> into<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.580> sides

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
pipe and welded into the sides

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.780 
pipe and welded into the sides
and<00:04:17.070> then<00:04:17.340> I'm<00:04:18.330> going<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:18.990> have<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.110> baffle

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
and then I'm going to have a baffle

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.590 
and then I'm going to have a baffle
probably<00:04:20.930> welded<00:04:21.930> up<00:04:22.200> out<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:23.390> three<00:04:24.390> meals

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
probably welded up out of three meals

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.670 
probably welded up out of three meals
still<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.860> that's<00:04:26.100> going<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.370> be<00:04:27.620> sort<00:04:28.620> of

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
still and that's going to be sort of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.050 
still and that's going to be sort of
arcing<00:04:29.340> around<00:04:29.700> from<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:29.970> bottom<00:04:30.360> up<00:04:30.900> to

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
arcing around from the bottom up to

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.940 
arcing around from the bottom up to
measure<00:04:33.060> them<00:04:33.240> out<00:04:33.390> just<00:04:34.080> over<00:04:34.320> half<00:04:34.530> why<00:04:34.800> I'm

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
measure them out just over half why I'm

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.230 
measure them out just over half why I'm
not<00:04:35.070> really<00:04:35.220> sure<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.730> anyone's<00:04:36.030> going<00:04:36.150> to

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
not really sure so if anyone's going to

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.690 
not really sure so if anyone's going to
tips<00:04:36.480> on<00:04:36.600> that<00:04:36.780> I'd<00:04:36.900> love<00:04:37.080> tonight<00:04:37.520> then<00:04:38.520> maybe

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
tips on that I'd love tonight then maybe

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.980 
tips on that I'd love tonight then maybe
sitting<00:04:41.150> sitting<00:04:42.150> about<00:04:42.390> two<00:04:42.630> inches<00:04:42.930> below

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
sitting sitting about two inches below
