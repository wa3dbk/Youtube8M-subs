to dehydrate the nail and just make sure

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910

it<00:00:32.910> only<00:00:33.090> goes<00:00:33.390> over<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> natural<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.500> not

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
it only goes over the natural now not

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.250 
it only goes over the natural now not
over<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> tip<00:00:35.969> because<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.510> crack<00:00:36.809> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.600

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
the length is okay not too wide so just

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.990 
the length is okay not too wide so just

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
taper it in at the side and then just

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.660 
taper it in at the side and then just
buff<00:02:39.450> over<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.080> hole<00:02:40.290> now<00:02:40.530> make<00:02:41.280> sure<00:02:41.310> that
