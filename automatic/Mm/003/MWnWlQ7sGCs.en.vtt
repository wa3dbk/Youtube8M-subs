of course Lara can always mow down more
enemies<00:01:53.880> now<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.570> avoid<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.990> scenario<00:01:55.170> as

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
enemies now to avoid that scenario as

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
enemies now to avoid that scenario as
she<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.009> finally<00:01:56.369> lock<00:01:56.520> onto<00:01:56.700> two<00:01:56.969> targets<00:01:57.360> at

gameplay<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.570> physics<00:02:00.899> improvements<00:02:01.350> really

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
gameplay and physics improvements really

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260

make<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> game<00:02:02.130> feel<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> lot<00:02:02.549> more<00:02:02.579> fluid<00:02:02.969> as

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
make the game feel a lot more fluid as

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.300 
make the game feel a lot more fluid as
Lara<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> less<00:02:03.960> limited<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:04.799> she<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.100> do

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
base so maybe I appreciate the water
