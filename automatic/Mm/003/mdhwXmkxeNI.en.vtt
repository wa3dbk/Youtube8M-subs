of<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.080> ball<00:01:44.319> but<00:01:45.069> that's<00:01:45.280> not<00:01:45.429> important

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
of that ball but that's not important

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.749 
of that ball but that's not important
what<00:01:46.330> is<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.869> he<00:01:46.990> took<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:48.250> catches<00:01:48.640> by

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
what is is that he took it to catches by

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.870 
what is is that he took it to catches by
Jeep<00:01:49.030> today<00:01:49.209> issue<00:01:49.720> with<00:01:49.959> a<00:01:49.990> nice<00:01:50.200> one<00:01:50.470> and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.950 

on<00:01:56.880> track<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.899> struck<00:01:58.229> by<00:01:58.439> Shantanu<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.960> do

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
on track one struck by Shantanu and do

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.389 
on track one struck by Shantanu and do
they<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.259> across<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.799> two<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> think<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
they go across the two I think the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.889 
they go across the two I think the
throws<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.090> strong<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.659> should<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
throws not that strong so should the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.050 
throws not that strong so should the
batsman<00:02:04.289> commit<00:02:04.679> themselves<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.909> might

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
batsman commit themselves they might

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.469 
batsman commit themselves they might
almost<00:02:06.479> always<00:02:06.689> make<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> two<00:02:08.030> right<00:02:09.030> back<00:02:09.269> to

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
almost always make the two right back to

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.690 
almost always make the two right back to
doing<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.050> few<00:02:10.259> basic<00:02:10.679> things<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.190> let's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
doing a few basic things right let's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.220 
doing a few basic things right let's
just<00:02:11.880> recount<00:02:12.269> them<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:12.599> keep<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.930> ball<00:02:13.200> on

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
just recount them one keep the ball on

just recount them one keep the ball on
the<00:02:13.440> stump<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.760> infielders<00:02:15.360> must<00:02:15.780> be

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the stump to the infielders must be

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.809 
the stump to the infielders must be
further<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.310> try<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.519> give<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
further in and we try and give you a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.490 
further in and we try and give you a
shot<00:02:18.030> later<00:02:18.269> on<00:02:18.450> about<00:02:18.569> how<00:02:18.840> far<00:02:19.080> they<00:02:19.260> really

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
shot later on about how far they really

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:32.500 
shot later on about how far they really
are<00:02:19.650> very<00:02:19.980> close<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> 30-yard<00:02:21.269> circle

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.120 

Clara<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.569> think<00:02:33.840> along<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.530> infielders

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
Clara I think along with the infielders

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.900 
Clara I think along with the infielders
the<00:02:35.790> boundary<00:02:36.360> riders<00:02:37.489> have<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.730> about

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the boundary riders have to be about

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.000 
the boundary riders have to be about
five<00:02:39.150> yards<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.599> as<00:02:39.750> well<00:02:39.930> there<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.620> go<00:02:40.799> there

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
five yards in as well there you go there

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.190 
five yards in as well there you go there
you<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.510> four<00:02:42.690> pillars<00:02:43.049> inside

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you see the the the four pillars inside

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.620 
you see the the the four pillars inside
the<00:02:43.500> ring<00:02:43.650> that's<00:02:43.799> a<00:02:44.010> single<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.420> day

the ring that's a single for the day

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.229 
the ring that's a single for the day
every<00:02:46.200> time<00:02:46.380> now<00:02:46.560> that's<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.670> air<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.030> that

absolutely stunning feeling my dish new
but<00:02:58.200> I've<00:02:58.320> got<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.710> agree<00:02:58.830> except<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.490> he<00:02:59.550> may

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
but I've got to agree except that he may

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.990 
but I've got to agree except that he may
have<00:03:00.240> trod<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.020> boundary<00:03:01.670> before<00:03:02.670> he

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
have trod on the boundary before he

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.410 
have trod on the boundary before he
released<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.450> boy<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.980> was<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> very<00:03:06.240> good

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
released the boy it was a very good

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.020 
released the boy it was a very good
afterthought<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.490> I<00:03:08.490> wonder<00:03:08.880> if<00:03:08.940> he<00:03:09.000> is

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
afterthought and I wonder if he is

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.670 
afterthought and I wonder if he is
injured<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.420> hope<00:03:09.600> not<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.410> he's<00:03:10.560> certainly

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
injured I hope not but he's certainly

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.260 
injured I hope not but he's certainly
suffering<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> after-effects<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.910> taking<00:03:12.210> a

brilliant catch then trotting on the

he wouldn't rush to it so I think you've

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.149 
he wouldn't rush to it so I think you've
got<00:05:16.689> to<00:05:16.840> go<00:05:16.990> with<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.229> fielders<00:05:17.590> what<00:05:17.770> if<00:05:17.889> if

got to go with the fielders what if if

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.959 
TV replays are inconclusive and there
you<00:05:22.449> see<00:05:22.629> see<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.199> Bengal<00:05:23.590> tigers<00:05:24.039> they<00:05:24.759> are

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
you see see the Bengal tigers they are

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.119 
you see see the Bengal tigers they are
charged<00:05:25.360> up<00:05:25.539> well<00:05:26.469> I<00:05:26.500> hope<00:05:26.710> he's<00:05:26.830> not<00:05:26.889> thinking

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
charged up well I hope he's not thinking

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.399 
charged up well I hope he's not thinking
he<00:05:27.370> actually<00:05:27.610> took<00:05:27.759> that<00:05:27.819> catch<00:05:28.389> fair<00:05:28.779> and<00:05:28.990> is

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
he actually took that catch fair and is

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.649 
he actually took that catch fair and is
claiming<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.830> catch<00:05:30.009> because<00:05:30.330> did<00:05:31.330> release<00:05:31.629> a

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
claiming the catch because did release a

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.600 
claiming the catch because did release a
lot<00:05:31.960> sooner<00:05:32.169> than<00:05:32.289> they<00:05:32.500> might<00:05:32.620> like<00:05:32.919> it's

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
lot sooner than they might like it's

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:42.879 
lot sooner than they might like it's
just<00:05:33.819> a<00:05:33.939> matter<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.330> boundary

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.399 

I<00:05:42.979> think<00:05:43.520> there<00:05:43.669> is<00:05:43.759> a<00:05:43.789> claim<00:05:44.090> perhaps<00:05:44.870> even<00:05:45.259> of

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
I think there is a claim perhaps even of

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.980 
I think there is a claim perhaps even of
the<00:05:45.530> catch<00:05:45.710> but<00:05:45.889> maybe<00:05:46.099> not<00:05:46.310> we'll<00:05:46.669> see

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.469 

yep<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.919> by<00:05:51.069> two<00:05:51.490> balls<00:05:51.699> left<00:05:51.940> that<00:05:52.180> we<00:05:52.330> can

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
yep and by two balls left that we can

00:05:52.479 --> 00:06:01.830 
yep and by two balls left that we can
confirm

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.690 

so<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.500> final<00:06:02.800> call<00:06:02.980> should<00:06:03.190> be<00:06:03.250> just<00:06:03.580> two

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
so the final call should be just two

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:15.040 
so the final call should be just two
runs<00:06:04.240> we<00:06:05.110> reconfirm<00:06:05.680> that<00:06:05.860> as<00:06:05.980> we<00:06:06.100> go<00:06:06.220> along

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.100 

so<00:06:15.560> that's<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.800> final<00:06:16.099> verdict<00:06:16.370> two<00:06:16.580> runs

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
so that's the final verdict two runs

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.379 
so that's the final verdict two runs
