cranked up the fuzz overdrive knob to
about<00:02:24.790> three<00:02:25.060> o'clock<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.860> put<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> switch

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
about three o'clock and put the switch

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.650 
about three o'clock and put the switch
up<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.610> give<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.879> little<00:02:28.000> bit<00:02:28.209> more<00:02:28.420> high-end

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
up to give it a little bit more high-end

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.780 
up to give it a little bit more high-end
attack<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.500> works<00:02:29.650> pretty<00:02:29.860> well<00:02:29.980> for<00:02:30.160> fast

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
