 ex ex ex holic with an animation 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.149
 peculiar divided into small stories 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.950
 to some extent tedious but 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.290
 containing everything with two 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 seasons of 24 and 23 chapters with some 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.390
 movies and their genres are supernatural 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 comedy drama and psychological kim and spin 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.660
 a student who has the ability to 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.890
 see the spirits which bothers him 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 but the story changes when it is 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.579
 attracted to a strange shop where yuko 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.220
 the owner and offers to take 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 stability but for this you will have to 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.040
 work on some missions where 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.809

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.620
 goss and how I entertained this series with 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.390
 very good research cases and 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.190
 very peculiar characters that I hope that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.260
 they like it since this series is a bit 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.270
 strange has 24 chapters of his 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.310
 genres are mystery romance and a little 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.780
 of other genres the story is 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.910
 develops after the first war 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.590

 beautiful intelligent and tender which 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.780
 almost nobody knows so perhaps already at 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.370
 have the privilege of working with her 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.110
 they will be put on difficult missions of 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.370
 decipher but nothing impossible with a 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.740
 very unexpected end 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.330
 another with a good story together with 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.890

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.630

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.160
 different a strange story blood and 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.240
 very interesting scenes besides the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.190
 history develops with the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.990
 perspective of many characters this 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.640
 anime has 22 chapters and two 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.190
 works with the supernatural genres 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.660
 horror mystery and drama in a village of 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.430
 Japanese are happening a series of 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.110
 strange and numerous deaths and there it is 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.760
 when a high class family moves 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.470
 to the people raising suspicions where 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.120
 will involve torture killings 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.480
 despair and especially a lot 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.480
 mystery 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.170
 look and nicky a well-known series that 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.030
 does not even need introduction but to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
 my opinion lacked psychology account 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.930
 with 26 chapters 2 eggs counting on the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 genres psychological thriller action 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.560
 mystery and romance 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.970
 djukic usa a lone student who 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.890
 inadvertently entered a game 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.630
 where the only object that is granted 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.670
 is the newspaper of the future which 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.870
 shows his future clearly to win 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.880
 this must be the last 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.320
 survivor so for that they will have 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 to get involved in murders without 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.190
 piety whose reward will be the god 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.020
 of time but I kit usa is not 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.670
 you will find alone since you will have there is one of 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.709
 his part a girl a little deranged 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.540
 so this will be a great battle without 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.969
 time to lose 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.379
 monsters a very good anime which has 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.120
 a little stuffing so I put it in 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.769
 this place since the characters have 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.599
 very coherent reactions and a story 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.060
 very good only that I recommend it 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.500
 see people as old as 16 or older and 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.629
 that otherwise they could be 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.340
 very heavy to see it counting with 74 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.159
 chapters and their genres are for rent 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.750
 psychological terror drama and mystery the 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.760
 story focuses on me having a theme 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.290
 medical surgeon but he is presented with a 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.359
 big problem since a child arrives at 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.980
 hospital in critical condition but before 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.260
 start the operation comes a politician and 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.269
 issue decide to operate the child loses his 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.069
 Work your future wife and the respect of 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.870
 people at the cost of this operation but 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.760
 shortly after his bosses are killed 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.870
 hospital and resume his employment but at 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.340
 realize that he was very much 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.859
 coincidence was given to the search for 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.269
 who killed his exjefes and why but 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.129
 for this you will have to enter to a 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.129
 series of situations almost suicidal 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.160
 figure without a crown what a good story 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.750
 simply magnificent next to this guy 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.700
 of animation that appears to be tender and 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.500
 fun hiding all the hate for 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.850
 behind and the development that is also 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.040
 well made with two 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.720
 seasons of 26 and 24 chapters with the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.360

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.310
 hell the life of keith that doing it 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.960
