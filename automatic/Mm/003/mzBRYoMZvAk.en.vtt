00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.490
 good morning guys, how are you? 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.490
 in these days truth and one of the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.349
 first 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.700
 first things that I always recommend 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.980
 to do is take a glass of water with 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.700
 lemon juice what are the benefits 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.119
 to take water with a few drops of juice 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.090
 of lemon well the lemon has a power 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.820
 very very antioxidant in addition it is also 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.379
 very rich is very rich in vitamin c what 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.989
 that helps us strengthen our 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:39.220
 immune system apart also the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.430
 vitamin c helps us to purify and clean 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.979
 the skin and together with the water 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.860
 drinking water with lemon drops 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.629
 It also helps us a lot to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.460
 eliminate toxins and purify our 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:57.519
 body also to tell you that you still have a 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.040
 acid flavor we should not confuse this 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.900
 taste the flavor of the lemon with the effect 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.610
 that leave inside our body the 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.710
 lemon is one of the foods one of the 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.330
 more alkaline fruits 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.510
 right now so it helps us 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.600
 balance the pH of our blood and 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.580
 also tell you that it is highly recommended 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 not only take 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.950
 the water with lemon like that, but 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.080
 also the water should be the water should 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.800
 have an ambient temperature of 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.390
 temperature of time or even a 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.880
 little hot 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.840
 we should warm it a little bit without 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.110
 come to boil for enzymes and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.750
 the lemon vitamins do not disappear or 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.869
 they do not get eliminated and they do not get damaged 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.619
 so water at room temperature or 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.720
 water a little warm and we go to 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.000
 make a good depurative effect what 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.520
 let's do is squeeze half a lemon 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.970
 although it is what I usually do 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 squeeze lemon or if not also 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.130
 I love using oils 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.870
 essential here I have a little bottle 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.990
 tiny little bit of essential oils and this 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.810
 It is lemon extract and with two 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.600
 droplets we would also have the same 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.150
 effect we could not add about two 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.760
 droplets of lemon to the water and take us 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.940
 I was there to clean and we also like the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.070
 organism so well as today we have 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.070
 lemons let's use a lime 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.540
 and the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.030
 and if you have a lemon scribe or 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.670
 of oranges or imas well more than better 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.220
 because it's a way 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.220
 very practical to take advantage of the magnet 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.299
 to clean the organism and health 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.130
 and some notes before saying goodbye 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.420
 because the water must be of time or a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.940
 little warm 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.610
 because because imagine when you wake up 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.830
 today and you do a shower of cold water 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.349
 cold that happens that your body gets 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.940
 contracts but if you give warm water to 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.830
 your body relaxes because it is what 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.440
 We started the day drinking water 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.540
 warm or warm so that our 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.390
 digestive system in this tract 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.960
 digestive can be dilated and relax 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.510
 another question that I receive the most is 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.940
 but carla the lemon juice is not going to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.800
 damaging tooth enamel the truth is that 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.870
 who has the dental mate a little bit 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.940
 more delicate and that can be harmful as well 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.430
 that my recommendation in these cases is 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.640
 Take the water with lemon using a 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.200
 hairline 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.870
 so I think these are the questions 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.390
 If you liked the video do not forget 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.890
 give me a like to leave a comment if 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.780
 you have more questions and especially 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.520
 share this information with everyone 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.300
 your friends and everything good to whom you 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.040
 may interest 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.040
 see you in the next goodbye
