crabbing in Florida

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.520 
crabbing in Florida
first<00:00:36.540> we're<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.809> I'll<00:00:36.930> adjust<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> grass

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
first we're here I'll adjust the grass

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
first we're here I'll adjust the grass
fly<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.129> three<00:00:38.489> feet<00:00:38.520> deep<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> this

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
fly it's about three feet deep and this

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
fly it's about three feet deep and this
flat<00:00:39.660> has<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.930> decent<00:00:40.590> amount<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.950> current<00:00:41.280> that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
flat has a decent amount of current that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.580 
flat has a decent amount of current that
goes<00:00:41.489> back<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> forth<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.899> found<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.410> one

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
goes back and forth so we found this one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
goes back and forth so we found this one
to<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.770> pretty<00:00:43.950> good<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:45.270> guess<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.870> you're

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to be pretty good and I guess if you're

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.450 
to be pretty good and I guess if you're
just<00:00:46.170> starting<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.710> off<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.309> good

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
just starting this off it's just good

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.819 
just starting this off it's just good
just<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> try<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.899> let<00:00:49.200> let<00:00:49.410> us<00:00:49.440> trap

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
just to try it and just let let us trap

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
just to try it and just let let us trap
sit<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> day<00:00:50.789> check<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> next<00:00:51.930> day

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
sit there for a day check the next day

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.779 
sit there for a day check the next day
if<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.379> fish<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.860> there's<00:00:53.070> crabs<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
if there's fish if there's crabs in it

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.450 
if there's fish if there's crabs in it
great<00:00:54.000> throw<00:00:54.690> some<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:55.020> down<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.739> move

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
great throw some more down if not move

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
great throw some more down if not move
somewhere<00:00:56.820> else<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.050> about

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
somewhere else and I was here about

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.540 
somewhere else and I was here about
three<00:00:58.350> weeks<00:00:58.530> ago<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.100> got<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.370> stone

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
three weeks ago and I got some stone

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
three weeks ago and I got some stone
crabs<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.449> we're<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> give<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
crabs here so we're going to give it a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.619 
crabs here so we're going to give it a
shot<00:01:01.230> again<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.180> bait<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
shot again and what we have for bait is

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.179 
shot again and what we have for bait is
that<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> use<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that we're going to use one of the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
that we're going to use one of the
redfish<00:01:05.519> heads<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.900> caught<00:01:07.110> earlier<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
redfish heads that we caught earlier and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000 
redfish heads that we caught earlier and
also<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> lady<00:01:08.610> fish<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.680> first<00:01:10.860> one

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
also a lady fish so for this first one

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
also a lady fish so for this first one
I'll<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.310> drop<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> lady<00:01:11.760> fish<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.150> there

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
I'll just drop the lady fish in there

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.870 
I'll just drop the lady fish in there
and<00:01:12.619> usually<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> slice<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and usually just kind of slice them in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.820 
and usually just kind of slice them in
there<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:16.200> some<00:01:16.439> scent<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
there just to get some scent in the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.320 
there just to get some scent in the
water<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:19.350> we'll<00:01:20.070> split<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.670> half<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
water and we'll split them in half so we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
water and we'll split them in half so we
can<00:01:21.509> fit<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> there

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.820 

so<00:01:30.310> that's<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.470> split<00:01:32.470> them<00:01:32.530> there<00:01:32.710> in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
so that's that and split them there in

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.880 
so that's that and split them there in
half<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.460> then<00:01:33.580> slide<00:01:33.970> them<00:01:34.119> on<00:01:34.270> into<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
half and then slide them on into the the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.390 
half and then slide them on into the the
overall<00:01:36.130> trap<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.880> just<00:01:37.659> put<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.320> put<00:01:39.310> the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
overall trap and just put the put the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.370 
overall trap and just put the put the
guard<00:01:39.610> down<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:41.530> as<00:01:41.740> simple<00:01:42.100> as<00:01:42.280> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
guard down and that as simple as that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.660 
guard down and that as simple as that
put<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.470> tail<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.100> doesn't<00:01:45.310> stick<00:01:45.460> all

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
put the tail in so it doesn't stick all

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.100 
put the tail in so it doesn't stick all
the<00:01:45.759> way<00:01:45.790> out<00:01:46.030> all<00:01:46.540> right<00:01:46.659> that'll<00:01:46.869> work<00:01:46.960> you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
the way out all right that'll work you

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.410 
the way out all right that'll work you
doubt<00:01:47.320> how<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.460> works<00:01:48.700> though<00:01:48.909> is<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
doubt how this works though is the the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.420 
doubt how this works though is the the
fish<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.380> actual<00:01:50.649> bait<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.039> needs<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.280> be<00:01:51.340> on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
fish the actual bait it needs to be on

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.990 
fish the actual bait it needs to be on
the<00:01:51.490> bottom

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
the bottom

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.090 
the bottom
if<00:01:52.600> not<00:01:52.869> then<00:01:53.110> sharks<00:01:53.470> will<00:01:53.649> come<00:01:53.680> up<00:01:53.950> and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
if not then sharks will come up and

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.570 
if not then sharks will come up and
actually<00:01:54.250> start<00:01:54.670> poking<00:01:55.180> up<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:56.220> cage<00:01:57.220> and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
actually start poking up the cage and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.510 
actually start poking up the cage and
mess<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.119> up<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:59.110> as<00:01:59.229> far<00:01:59.380> as<00:01:59.440> placement<00:01:59.799> a<00:02:00.190> lot

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
mess it up so as far as placement a lot

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.950 
mess it up so as far as placement a lot
of<00:02:00.580> times<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.819> try<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.030> look<00:02:01.179> for<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.450> little

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
of times I try to look for a little

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.850 
of times I try to look for a little
clearing<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.560> little<00:02:02.890> wide<00:02:03.550> area<00:02:03.970> but<00:02:04.929> over

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
clearing a little wide area but over

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.169 
clearing a little wide area but over
here<00:02:06.009> it's<00:02:06.159> always<00:02:06.340> like<00:02:06.580> grass<00:02:06.819> we'll<00:02:07.060> just

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
here it's always like grass we'll just

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.249 
here it's always like grass we'll just
go<00:02:07.240> ahead<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.509> drop<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:07.929> see<00:02:08.140> what

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
go ahead and drop it and see what

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.630 
go ahead and drop it and see what
happens<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.910> place<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.149> down<00:02:11.519> buoys<00:02:12.519> out

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
happens so just place it down buoys out

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.920 
happens so just place it down buoys out
and<00:02:12.910> again<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.239> only<00:02:13.360> three<00:02:13.569> feet<00:02:13.750> deep<00:02:13.870> so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and again it's only three feet deep so

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.890 
and again it's only three feet deep so
that's<00:02:14.170> plenty<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.560> rope<00:02:17.640> now<00:02:18.640> for<00:02:19.060> trap

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
that's plenty of rope now for trap

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.150 
that's plenty of rope now for trap
number<00:02:20.110> two<00:02:24.090> same<00:02:25.090> thing<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:26.069> with<00:02:27.069> this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
number two same thing here with this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.670 
number two same thing here with this
redfish<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.730> must<00:02:27.880> go<00:02:28.060> ahead<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.350> cut<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.470> head

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
redfish I must go ahead and cut the head

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:40.550 
redfish I must go ahead and cut the head
off

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.260 

so<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.710> did<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.100> this<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.820> red<00:02:43.090> fish

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
so what I did is I this is a red fish

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.570 
so what I did is I this is a red fish
that<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.570> flayed<00:02:43.840> earlier<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:45.070> just<00:02:45.160> using

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
that we flayed earlier and I just using

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.150 
that we flayed earlier and I just using
the<00:02:45.670> head<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.090> reuse<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.140> when<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:47.980> was

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
the head just to reuse it and when I was

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.460 
the head just to reuse it and when I was
out<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.520> couple<00:02:48.760> weeks<00:02:48.850> ago<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.900> shark<00:02:50.350> or

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
out here a couple weeks ago a shark or

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.690 
out here a couple weeks ago a shark or
something<00:02:50.500> came<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.340> completely

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
something came in and just completely

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.460 
something came in and just completely
ruined<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.330> trap<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.110> I'm<00:02:53.170> gonna<00:02:53.260> have<00:02:53.410> to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
ruined the trap so I'm gonna have to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.770 
ruined the trap so I'm gonna have to
actually<00:02:54.400> tie<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.700> down<00:02:54.910> with<00:02:55.210> that<00:02:55.240> with<00:02:55.540> mono

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
actually tie it down with that with mono

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.130 
actually tie it down with that with mono
but<00:02:56.710> as<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.490> see<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.420> red

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
but as you can see this is just a red

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.890 
but as you can see this is just a red
fish<00:02:59.320> head<00:02:59.530> here<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:01.150> we<00:03:01.570> will<00:03:01.720> hopefully

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
fish head here and and we will hopefully

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.930 
fish head here and and we will hopefully
get<00:03:02.560> some<00:03:02.860> big<00:03:03.120> crabbers<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:06.460> let's<00:03:06.610> go<00:03:06.760> over

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
get some big crabbers so let's go over

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.620 
get some big crabbers so let's go over
tie<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.000> thing<00:03:10.450> down<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:15.910> around<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.390> time

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
tie this thing down go around the time

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.860 
tie this thing down go around the time
or<00:03:16.810> two

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
or two

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.660 
or two
so<00:03:19.870> hopefully<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.530> old<00:03:20.830> sharks<00:03:21.160> don't<00:03:21.340> get<00:03:21.520> in

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
so hopefully the old sharks don't get in

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.280 
so hopefully the old sharks don't get in
if<00:03:21.790> they<00:03:21.910> do<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.420> then<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.570> hope<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.930> cameras

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
if they do and then I hope the cameras

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.630 
if they do and then I hope the cameras
on<00:03:23.440> while<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:23.800> happening<00:03:23.920> because<00:03:24.550> that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
on while it's happening because that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:48.500 
on while it's happening because that
would<00:03:24.760> be<00:03:24.850> awesome<00:03:27.030> just<00:03:28.030> tie<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:28.450> off

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.120 

all<00:03:49.510> right<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.750> we're<00:03:49.870> all<00:03:49.900> tied<00:03:50.170> down<00:03:50.380> now

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
all right so we're all tied down now

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.050 
all right so we're all tied down now
time<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.490> drop<00:03:52.060> her<00:03:52.240> down<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.870> we<00:03:56.530> will<00:03:56.709> just

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
time to drop her down so we will just

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.130 
time to drop her down so we will just
the<00:03:58.060> currents<00:03:58.390> going<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.720> way<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.870> try<00:03:59.080> to

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
the currents going that way I try to

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.199 
the currents going that way I try to
have<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.620> the<00:04:00.069> currents<00:04:00.459> going<00:04:00.610> from<00:04:00.940> you

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
have the the currents going from you

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.610 
have the the currents going from you
know<00:04:01.300> back<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.630> forth<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:01.989> try<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.200> have<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
know back and forth so I try to have the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.500 
know back and forth so I try to have the
the<00:04:02.950> openings<00:04:03.370> going<00:04:03.700> towards<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.300> current

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the openings going towards the current

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.380 
the openings going towards the current
both<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.290> out<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:06.430> we<00:04:06.819> will<00:04:06.970> go<00:04:07.120> ahead<00:04:07.239> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
both in and out and we will go ahead and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:15.330 
both in and out and we will go ahead and
just<00:04:07.450> drop<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.930> on<00:04:08.050> in<00:04:13.410> now<00:04:14.410> it's<00:04:14.680> time<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.100> sit

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
just drop it on in now it's time to sit

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.280 
just drop it on in now it's time to sit
and<00:04:15.370> wait<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:15.880> tomorrow<00:04:16.810> morning<00:04:17.109> we'll<00:04:17.200> go

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
and wait and tomorrow morning we'll go

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.449 
and wait and tomorrow morning we'll go
check<00:04:17.530> in<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.799> hopefully<00:04:17.919> there's<00:04:18.190> some<00:04:18.310> big

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
check in and hopefully there's some big
