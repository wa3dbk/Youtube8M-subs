 taut body with a chase for relief 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.630
 muscles a man is ready to keep tight 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.260
 diet and a few hours to engage in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.929
 simulators 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
 however, as practice sometimes shows 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.509
 muscle growth 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.929
 exhausting exercise 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.929
 not enough 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.180
 during training when a person

 physical exertion our body 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.860
 enters the healing process 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.680
 while restoring more fabric 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.450
 what was damaged in this way 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.010
 the healing mechanism lead to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.769
 friction it increases also the cell 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 with constant training more and more 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.780
 stocked up by that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 most increasing in volume to muscle 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.260
