00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.040
 I do not see the 16 the true and today it's up there 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.620
 how to make a target the holders can count on the dots 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.929
 So I had prepared myself out of the first, this sum is only gate 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.179
 set it up like this 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.749
 Accordingly, the small could have been 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.909
 because of this 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.839
 under 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.630
 OZ and middle 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.779
 and an intimate refrigerator doors could already 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 even more 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.130
 Janssen sitting in the middle 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.330
 yes okay Mesic kink in optics here 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.810
 it is not too much 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.060
 Dr 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.380
 4 after agreement type ci-module 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.380
 then Menke here Preussner 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.630
 with TEUR 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.140
 but that must be very important Nani must not clinker Momus son rusty 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.290
 Lochau me 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.290
 if it does not have it then it will not do that anymore 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 ad 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.230
 then prompt her tormentor 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.220
 the fire he goes to percent of human 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.990
 Percent of Stegner constructing in cloud Jakob makes that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.620
 and then he does three of these 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.190
 of these pomplun has an end 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.210
 then we are 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.950
 Location 4 percent is the one with the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.470
 the respective company 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 Arrington 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.420
 that makes the taker stop here 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.510
 makes two players fly to the right click 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.620
 because ever the Heyden and Marketer times with right-click on the blue and damage 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.450
 bottom left percent of mixes Hector lies 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 and that's what happened in that order 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.980
 provides 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 what is needed now is one 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.900
 Arid u World War Schiphol Arbon Crisis country 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 yes in kitchens 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.479
 There are many AXA people on a server 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.489
 Woitenko Scriptor 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.519
 Smart my press 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.239
 So when Amauri wiring the singer Baumann when warm 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.099
 and then you make your concert in Berlin 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.150
 around 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.829
 three birdies 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.429
 Weimar come with percent 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.649
 so talk 50 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.829
 25 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.929
 and 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:34.789
 5 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.509
 Kaiser Ruland Research 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.699
 to bring my politicians there 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.989
 and then he would have to shake the few of the crisis countries 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:51.579
 to picture consumption Valeri where a life in the order brings the red 50 green 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.919
 25 to blue-green algae 5 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.969
 too bad 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.389
 especially like 1 50 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.989
 ARZ from the next 3 to the announcement the 2 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.549
 25 and stick to it 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.549
 Source reelection 5 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.539
 Percent with her 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.449
 so what 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.589
 Bavarian 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:21.899
 you still need a button 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:25.829
 that must be big acts so big well percent 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.829
 Melt Umberto i 1 and I wear 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.540
 the one stuck to the murder series 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.789
 the claimants on the door 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.939
 Horn then does 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.219
 Reset from the serious chips to it 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.399
 sda 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.529
 then 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.309
 Do Dr 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:49.539
 this is one of Kaprun's chips 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.539
 over there are percent of who meets Eck meets 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.569
 what do we need now? 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.569
 well we need three screens 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.639
 but once 50 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.679
 where 50 give up 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.679
 Vogt 25 is on it 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.299
 and where 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.009
 not just happy 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.629
 So five years 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.439
 what brownie tried 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.990
 Where 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.809
 Â«Small accidentÂ» m 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.669
 also my degree 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 I have to understate the tarnished a bit 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.620
 if that and you begged that's just always so much more eels 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.610
 I know how long have I been watching movies but now it continues 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.650
 Percent you need a patch apn 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.650
 and one more win and she has to stop there 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.780
 write in something okay I have degrees of cold water 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.360
 Investor writing so flies to care Jep 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.259
 Venne that's in there Well then that's not possible 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.319
 but that almost matches at 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.729
 Salzgitter by at longer stint Christmann notes 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.210
 So 8 of 11 Chap to a crisis summit 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.710
 missing completely ship to the next and then so on with c to my country 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.860
 and then there has to be a look something 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.350
 the stormy one-percent so no now again here means 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.110
 this stream comes to the first Kretschmann Tel 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.749
 These quirky comes to the 25 areas and the last 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.059
 I think that was it then you can go to the ball 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.990
 Euro 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.719
 50 the sum 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.719
 some outside 5 55 clock 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.740
