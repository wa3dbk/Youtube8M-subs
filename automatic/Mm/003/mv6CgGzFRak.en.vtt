 hello you flatten kers as they are I am wiki and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.760
 today I come to present you a new video 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.830
 tutorial on how to install a custom 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.560
 recovery on any device with 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.330
 Android good first thing first 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.380
 we have to do is go to the play store 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.380
 and look for the this application recovery x 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.430
 recover x search 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.210
 and the first option that is this we 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.070
 this application will come out 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.239
 and as we see we do not weigh many passes 154 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.699
 kilobytes and already once we have it 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.460
 installed only we open it and we 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.350
 will come out this screen will ask us for permits 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.290
 from superuser we accept them as 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.560
 always and we start 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.260
 will make a small download and here we 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.440
 has a very broad list of several 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.020
 files of several of several companies 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.400
 of cell phones to install the recovery 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.310
 well in my case this is the nexus 7 and the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.070
 we open 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.210
 and here we have it those are the recovery 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.180
 is that you have the application available 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.340
 for our device equal to 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.590
 others have maybe have others 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.939
 different this varies as we see here 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.509
 it has three but good we install and here 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.240
 is 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.270
 I'm going to download the normal one we hope to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.189
 download 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.630
 it does not take long the process is very fast 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.990
 and in a very short time we already have 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.270
 installed the recovery 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.270
 We wait for half load 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 it did not take long 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.740
 good hope we hope 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 90% 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.510
 is already installed well and here we are going to 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.630
 say the possible ways that we will have 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.870
 this varies according to the device 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.780
 pressing the back button while 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.130
 it turns on in this device is touch 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.020
 so do not press the volume key 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.690
 while this is possible, it is possible to 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.569
 this device or press the screen 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.780
 while you are while you are learning 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.420
 restarting press ok if you want if 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.030
 like you can qualify the application the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.640
 which is very good 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.370
 and as you can see we already have it 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.170
 installed when we restart good 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.630
