basically really easy we're going to be

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.330 
basically really easy we're going to be
using<00:00:41.640> some<00:00:41.969> diluted<00:00:42.660> beastie<00:00:43.649> Brown<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
we're gonna cover this bad boy I should

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
we're gonna cover this bad boy I should
call<00:00:48.059> him<00:00:48.210> probably<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.469> dirty

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

call him probably like that this dirty
old<00:00:50.370> boy<00:00:50.690> but<00:00:51.690> basically<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
old boy but basically this is a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260 
old boy but basically this is a
technique<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.129> used<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> letter<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
technique I used to do the letter and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
technique I used to do the letter and
and<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.750> sorts<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> things<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> want<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and all sorts of things when I want to

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
and all sorts of things when I want to
go<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.550> fast<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:59.059> think<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
go like fast I think it's like kind of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
go like fast I think it's like kind of
like<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> mix<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.770> between<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
like a mix in between you know the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.390 
like a mix in between you know the
normal<00:01:03.000> glazing<00:01:03.780> technique<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> would

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
normal glazing technique which you would

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.679 
normal glazing technique which you would
like<00:01:05.700> start<00:01:06.330> glazing<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:08.330> model<00:01:09.330> itself

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
like start glazing all your model itself

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
like start glazing all your model itself
from<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> shadows<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.100> highlights

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
from the shadows to the highlights

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.030 
from the shadows to the highlights
second<00:01:12.000> highlights<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> his<00:01:12.750> versa<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.380> this

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
second highlights and his versa and this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
second highlights and his versa and this
quick<00:01:14.369> technique<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.390> basically<00:01:16.290> what

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
quick technique I use it basically what

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.020 
quick technique I use it basically what
I<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.670> glazing

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I want to do like kind of a glazing

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.760 
I want to do like kind of a glazing
effect<00:01:18.570> looks<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.229> nicer<00:01:19.259> but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
effect looks a little bit nicer but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.670 
effect looks a little bit nicer but
really<00:01:20.100> quickly<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.900> works<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.320> well

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
really quickly and it works really well

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.429 
really quickly and it works really well
for<00:01:22.740> letter<00:01:23.670> e<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.180> brownish<00:01:24.689> colors<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
for letter e or brownish colors so

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
for letter e or brownish colors so
that's<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.159> trying<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.640> achieve<00:01:26.729> here

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that's what I'm trying to achieve here

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's what I'm trying to achieve here
so<00:01:27.600> I'm<00:01:27.659> using<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> Ichiban<00:01:28.350> Studio<00:01:28.920> Pro<00:01:29.520> Line

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so I'm using the Ichiban Studio Pro Line

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.920 
so I'm using the Ichiban Studio Pro Line
brushes<00:01:30.570> right<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
brushes right there I think this is that

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.430 
brushes right there I think this is that
102<00:01:33.940> basically<00:01:34.940> using<00:01:35.330> for<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.050> basically

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
102 basically using for the basically

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.850 
102 basically using for the basically
this<00:01:36.800> model<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:38.140> that's<00:01:39.140> pretty<00:01:39.290> much<00:01:39.440> it

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
this model and that's pretty much it

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.250 
this model and that's pretty much it
we're<00:01:40.550> going<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.730> skip<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:41.180> fast-forward<00:01:41.960> and

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
we're going to skip in fast-forward and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:02:28.979 
we're going to skip in fast-forward and
I'll<00:01:43.250> see<00:01:43.550> you<00:01:43.760> in<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.270> next<00:01:44.660> technique

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.319 

so<00:02:29.989> first<00:02:30.260> base<00:02:30.470> coat<00:02:30.769> was<00:02:31.040> completed<00:02:31.819> right

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
so first base coat was completed right

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.880 
so first base coat was completed right
about<00:02:32.629> now<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:32.900> basically<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.500> did<00:02:33.680> two

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
about now and basically I did two

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.920 
about now and basically I did two
bracelets<00:02:34.129> I<00:02:34.459> repeated<00:02:34.909> this<00:02:35.090> process<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.690> just

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
bracelets I repeated this process I just

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.990 
bracelets I repeated this process I just
did<00:02:36.079> one<00:02:36.319> more<00:02:36.349> time<00:02:36.769> just<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.459> get<00:02:37.610> have<00:02:37.970> a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
did one more time just to get have a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 
did one more time just to get have a
nice<00:02:38.269> base<00:02:38.480> color<00:02:38.780> but<00:02:39.319> still<00:02:39.590> let<00:02:39.799> some

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
nice base color but still let some

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.400 
nice base color but still let some
transparence<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.030> white<00:02:41.720> primer<00:02:42.079> that<00:02:42.200> I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
transparence to the white primer that I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.309 
transparence to the white primer that I
have<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.829> wash<00:02:43.250> shading<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.049> where<00:02:45.290> I

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
have so wash shading so this is where I

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.050 
have so wash shading so this is where I
cheat<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:45.799> little<00:02:46.069> bit<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.760> what

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
cheat a little bit and this is what

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.610 
cheat a little bit and this is what
makes<00:02:47.329> this<00:02:47.510> technique<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.989> little<00:02:48.230> bit<00:02:48.349> quick

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
makes this technique a little bit quick

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.460 
makes this technique a little bit quick
is<00:02:48.829> that<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.370> use<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.970> wash<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:50.599> using<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.200> our

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
is that I use a wash so using the our

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.190 
is that I use a wash so using the our
rack<00:02:51.859> streak<00:02:52.519> shape<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:53.090> will<00:02:53.690> apply<00:02:54.109> it

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
rack streak shape I will apply it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.250 
rack streak shape I will apply it
everywhere<00:02:54.650> on<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.720> know<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.019> brown

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
everywhere on the you know the brown

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.339 
everywhere on the you know the brown
parts<00:02:57.769> or<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.010> beastie<00:02:58.430> Brown<00:02:58.640> parts<00:02:59.030> of<00:03:00.019> this

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
parts or the beastie Brown parts of this

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.149 
parts or the beastie Brown parts of this
model<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.879> try<00:03:02.720> not<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.019> get<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.440> pulling<00:03:03.950> too

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
model I try not to get it pulling too

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
pure leather round and then we're going

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.740 
pure leather round and then we're going
to<00:05:25.680> use<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:26.220> same<00:05:26.400> process<00:05:27.000> that<00:05:27.030> we<00:05:27.300> use<00:05:27.510> for

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
to use the same process that we use for

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.080 
to use the same process that we use for
the<00:05:27.900> previous<00:05:28.590> one<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.010> then<00:05:29.490> like<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:29.790> said<00:05:29.820> in

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
the previous one and then like I said in

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.400 
the previous one and then like I said in
the<00:05:30.180> beginning<00:05:30.300> of<00:05:30.600> this<00:05:30.720> tutorial<00:05:31.290> is

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
the beginning of this tutorial is

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.020 
the beginning of this tutorial is
basically<00:05:31.830> this<00:05:31.979> is<00:05:32.190> how<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.430> do<00:05:32.729> it<00:05:32.850> quickly

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
basically this is how to do it quickly

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.450 
basically this is how to do it quickly
you<00:05:33.389> can<00:05:33.570> do<00:05:33.690> it<00:05:33.810> with<00:05:33.960> any<00:05:34.110> other<00:05:34.229> colors<00:05:34.889> I

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
you can do it with any other colors I

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.150 
you can do it with any other colors I
found<00:05:36.120> that<00:05:36.389> with<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.780> beastie<00:05:37.139> not<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.889> BC

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
found that with the beastie not the BC

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.100 
found that with the beastie not the BC
Brown<00:05:38.340> with<00:05:38.460> our<00:05:38.669> dragster<00:05:39.090> shape<00:05:39.389> it<00:05:39.870> works

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
Brown with our dragster shape it works

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.219 
Brown with our dragster shape it works
best<00:05:40.410> with<00:05:40.620> brown<00:05:40.950> colors<00:05:41.419> but<00:05:42.419> if<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:43.020> would

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
best with brown colors but if you would

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.290 
best with brown colors but if you would
do<00:05:43.410> red<00:05:43.770> or<00:05:44.130> things<00:05:44.520> like<00:05:44.580> that<00:05:44.700> then<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.120> can

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
do red or things like that then you can

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.719 
do red or things like that then you can
use<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.479> black<00:05:45.930> washer<00:05:46.530> or<00:05:46.650> black<00:05:46.889> ink<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.700> make

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
use a black washer or black ink to make

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.969 
use a black washer or black ink to make
it<00:05:48.030> pool<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.479> recesses<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.260> then<00:05:49.800> it

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
it pool in the recesses and then it

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.800 
it pool in the recesses and then it
basically<00:05:50.220> saves<00:05:50.820> you<00:05:50.970> a<00:05:51.030> whole<00:05:51.090> lot<00:05:51.479> of<00:05:51.510> time

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
basically saves you a whole lot of time

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.680 
basically saves you a whole lot of time
to<00:05:52.050> go<00:05:52.200> in<00:05:52.410> and<00:05:52.590> then<00:05:53.370> doing<00:05:54.090> all<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.419> shadows

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
to go in and then doing all the shadows

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.930 
to go in and then doing all the shadows
first<00:05:55.200> so<00:05:55.350> basically<00:05:55.650> a<00:05:55.950> normal<00:05:56.400> glaze

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
first so basically a normal glaze

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.879 
first so basically a normal glaze
technique<00:05:57.450> would<00:05:57.690> be<00:05:57.840> like<00:05:58.050> doing<00:05:58.260> your<00:05:58.500> your

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
technique would be like doing your your

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.820 
technique would be like doing your your
first<00:05:59.360> medium<00:06:00.360> color<00:06:00.630> you're<00:06:01.260> the<00:06:01.500> one<00:06:01.680> that's

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
first medium color you're the one that's

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.640 
first medium color you're the one that's
in<00:06:02.039> the<00:06:02.070> middle<00:06:02.570> of<00:06:03.570> your<00:06:03.720> triad<00:06:04.169> of<00:06:04.320> colors

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
in the middle of your triad of colors

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.770 
in the middle of your triad of colors
then<00:06:04.889> after<00:06:05.160> that<00:06:05.280> do<00:06:05.820> all<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.180> shadow<00:06:06.479> which

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
then after that do all the shadow which

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.629 
then after that do all the shadow which
are<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.080> recesses<00:06:07.470> with<00:06:07.800> your<00:06:08.010> darker<00:06:08.400> color

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
are the recesses with your darker color

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.450 
are the recesses with your darker color
and<00:06:08.880> then<00:06:09.000> move<00:06:09.210> on<00:06:09.449> to<00:06:09.660> your<00:06:10.190> back<00:06:11.190> to<00:06:11.220> your

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
and then move on to your back to your

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.010 
and then move on to your back to your
middle<00:06:11.729> color<00:06:12.060> just<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.450> make<00:06:12.660> a<00:06:12.690> smooth

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
middle color just to make a smooth

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.260 
middle color just to make a smooth
transition<00:06:13.530> on<00:06:13.830> those<00:06:14.010> pores<00:06:14.760> of<00:06:14.940> the<00:06:14.970> raised

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
transition on those pores of the raised

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.629 
transition on those pores of the raised
edges<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:16.410> then<00:06:16.620> after<00:06:17.160> that<00:06:17.250> the<00:06:17.430> first

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
edges and then after that the first

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.400 
edges and then after that the first
highlight<00:06:18.090> second<00:06:18.570> highlight<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:19.080> sometimes

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
highlight second highlight and sometimes

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.230 
highlight second highlight and sometimes
people<00:06:19.620> three<00:06:20.160> or<00:06:20.280> four<00:06:20.550> depending<00:06:20.789> on<00:06:21.090> how

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
people three or four depending on how

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.540 
people three or four depending on how
nice<00:06:21.479> you<00:06:21.660> want<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:21.930> model<00:06:22.229> to<00:06:22.620> look<00:06:22.740> like<00:06:22.800> but

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
nice you want a model to look like but

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.159 
nice you want a model to look like but
for<00:06:23.760> something<00:06:24.000> that<00:06:24.360> is<00:06:24.539> really<00:06:24.900> quick<00:06:25.139> and

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
for something that is really quick and

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.570 
for something that is really quick and
dirty<00:06:25.530> you<00:06:25.889> know

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
dirty you know

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.850 
dirty you know
tabletop<00:06:26.910> or<00:06:27.270> above<00:06:27.539> tabletop<00:06:28.139> just<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.710> make

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
tabletop or above tabletop just to make

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.469 
tabletop or above tabletop just to make
them<00:06:29.039> stand<00:06:29.370> out<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:29.610> little<00:06:29.880> bit<00:06:30.030> more<00:06:30.300> I<00:06:30.330> think

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
them stand out a little bit more I think

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.450 
them stand out a little bit more I think
that<00:06:30.810> this<00:06:30.990> technique<00:06:31.380> is<00:06:31.500> pretty<00:06:31.770> cool<00:06:31.979> it

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
that this technique is pretty cool it

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.070 
that this technique is pretty cool it
does<00:06:32.700> it<00:06:33.090> is<00:06:33.389> a<00:06:33.419> little<00:06:33.539> bit<00:06:33.840> time-consuming

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
does it is a little bit time-consuming

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.219 
does it is a little bit time-consuming
but<00:06:34.970> at<00:06:35.970> the<00:06:36.060> same<00:06:36.210> time<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.570> does<00:06:36.720> look<00:06:36.990> better

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
but at the same time it does look better

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.260 
but at the same time it does look better
than<00:06:37.590> just<00:06:37.889> you<00:06:38.070> know<00:06:38.190> applying<00:06:38.880> a<00:06:39.030> base<00:06:39.210> coat

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
than just you know applying a base coat

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.379 
than just you know applying a base coat
and<00:06:39.660> then<00:06:39.780> washing<00:06:40.260> it<00:06:40.410> and<00:06:40.560> that's<00:06:40.770> it<00:06:41.070> and<00:06:41.389> if

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
and then washing it and that's it and if

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.360 
and then washing it and that's it and if
you're<00:06:42.840> using<00:06:43.050> diluted<00:06:43.710> paint<00:06:43.919> then<00:06:44.190> your
