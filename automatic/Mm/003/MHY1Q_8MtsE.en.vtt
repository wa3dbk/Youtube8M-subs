00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.550
 It is as simple as looking at this 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.910
 you put in the downloads 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.019

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.960
 which is what I told you about the troll and 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.800

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.770
 here he says that they put the number 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.870

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.430

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.239
