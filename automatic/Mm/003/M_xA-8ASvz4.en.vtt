00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.640
 so lilo minecraft that i'm jewish 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:27.250
 sarris and say welcome to one 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.270
 Little the show of my old holes 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.230
 and currently he should the items 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.370
 stone brix and clear glass 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.129
 currently it runs like this one runs here 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.879
 a very long run please go to the 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.420
 route wool 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.890
 It gets dark for a moment, it gets light again 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.890
 and then you out here in this 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.710
 Cage and below in the chat comes one 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.420
 Message prohibited items were removed 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.630
 and as you can see it is in my whole 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.610
 Inventory again glass still stonebridge 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:03.720
 and everyone else is still there 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.729
 how does it work? 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.740
 or otherwise you need that 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.240
 I think of adventure maps or something 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.890
 It's always usable when you look 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.950
 the player's inventory individual 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.860
 things can be deleted for example 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.180
 you want it to be a thing dependent on 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.100
 do something for example in one 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.930
 Casino with you want a currency 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.350
 if you do not have money plugin 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 on it has happened often normal 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.240
 leaves then by dispenser as 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.659
 number can be taken as a value 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.080
 can 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.790
 but someone there of course a plantation 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.380
 did he laughs about it, of course, because he 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.570
 he could produce his own money 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.810
 but everyone takes money into it 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.189
 It would lose it for example 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.689
 my idea how that works 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.880
 something is being deleted 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.490
 alone at this command block and indeed 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.530
 this commando blog is built with 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.330
 the command / klier the command also says 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.520
 that any item from the inventory 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.489
 will be deleted then 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.980
 this is target in jerez player is called the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.769
 player officials closest to this one 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.830
 commando blog tuned gets this 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.050
 command in this case but I have 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.210
 in square brackets still the coordinates 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.400
 hung behind it and the radius 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.710
 Now ring that the one of the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.440
 next to these coordinates in this 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.360
 radio dran the older is the whole off 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 get when you continue like two stones 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.400
 of this from the goal of the ex 159 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.510
 gone is he just command for 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.850
 nobody had been 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.340
 So only if you're inside on the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.980
 red wool stands you get the block 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.370
 with the number 20 deducted what in my 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.910
 case 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.270
 Glass is and this blog counts here 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.490
 the old one with the number 98 from what 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.770
 they are also the story tricks 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.410
 wladimir were deducted what then 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.410
 continues to happen with a bit 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.830
 delay comes once this command 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.830
 here 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.830
 he is made up of teleport so / dpa 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.540
 the player on the red wool again 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.610
 exactly the same as over there to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.770
 be teleported to these 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.470
 coordinates what in my case exactly in the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.700
 Cage inside is and again with 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.220
 little delay we come to 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.840
 this blog here 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.010
 this blog has a very easy one 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:39.020
 namely the command the player 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.540
 So that should be in the cage 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.970
 Said forbidden items were said 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.860
 away and that was the whole thing 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.990
 magic what I have done now 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.690
 I do not have it all with one 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.400
 pressure plate made but here with so 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.150
 a small construction here has a pure 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.210
 running takes a flower here 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.910
 this is where the signal goes out and the 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.400
 chain is triggered here and the one 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.480
 the older one has no grass left 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.860
 yahoo then there will be a few doors left 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.550
 closed in here 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.590
 by slopes simply the sounds high and 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.720
 just before teleporting, pull 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.030
 here two slopes it again stones away 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.430
 and it is illuminated again why 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.570
 a teleport light I wanted that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.980
 let's look but that actually has 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.890
 not working as well as me 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.580
 wanted to but is actually not so 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.900
 important i will show you again 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.390
 So no matter where you have it even if you 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.850
 you in the inventory even if you have 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:44.300
 Give courage 0 when you enter 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.040
 marches and it gets dark once 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.880
 thus one has exploited in his 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.750
 entire inventory no glass anymore 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.200
 for a flower so that's it 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.850
 again 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.440
 i think i will be a tutorial for that 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.510
 do not need it because I actually 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.070
 explained everything and I wish a lot 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.450
 Have fun with the commando blogs always 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.190
 copy and maybe you can too 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.030
 change the design a little bit or 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.070
 to make all the fancier and 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.160
 you can still be an afterword you can do so 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.920
 Many blogs we ban widely inventory 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.500
 unfortunately you can with these blogs in 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.890
 do not delete singleplayer 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.170
 I do not know if it is in the course of one 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.080
 budget version works because there is yes 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.580
 from bucket the command klier with which 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.190
 entire inventory is deleted 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.330
 it is here in singleplayer without 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.030
 single player come 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.290
 it may be that of the awv bucket 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.740
 I do not know 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.550
 So have fun with minecraft still in the 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.550
 further course
