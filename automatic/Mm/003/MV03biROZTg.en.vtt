now yes I mean it wasn't that wasn't the
objective<00:01:51.659> per<00:01:51.869> se<00:01:52.079> we've<00:01:52.439> ended<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.799> way

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
objective per se we've ended that way

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
objective per se we've ended that way
but<00:01:53.130> they're<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:53.880> best<00:01:53.909> drivers<00:01:54.509> i<00:01:54.600> can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
but they're the two best drivers i can

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.020 
but they're the two best drivers i can
imagine<00:01:54.899> having<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.530> team<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> niko<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
imagine having in a team and niko is a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
imagine having in a team and niko is a
fantastically<00:01:57.869> exciting<00:01:58.290> prospect<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
fantastically exciting prospect and I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.179 
fantastically exciting prospect and I
think<00:02:00.049> his<00:02:01.049> partnership<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.619> Michael<00:02:02.009> he's
