00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.240 
think you did better than I did I shot
it<00:04:42.440> on<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.710> d3x<00:04:43.669> with<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.540> 70<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.110> 200<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.650> 1.4

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
it on a d3x with a 70 to 200 the 1.4

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.830 
it on a d3x with a 70 to 200 the 1.4
converter<00:04:46.760> which<00:04:47.030> gave<00:04:47.330> me<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.510> little<00:04:47.690> extra

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
converter which gave me a little extra

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.320 
converter which gave me a little extra
reach<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.500> can<00:04:48.680> crop<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:49.280> image<00:04:49.880> nicely

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
reach and I can crop that image nicely

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.670 
reach and I can crop that image nicely
but<00:04:50.479> I<00:04:50.540> really<00:04:50.780> don't<00:04:50.900> think<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.169> got<00:04:51.320> anything

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
really bad yeah but you know I think

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.670 
really bad yeah but you know I think
whenever<00:06:05.419> you<00:06:05.570> do<00:06:05.720> these<00:06:05.870> events<00:06:06.200> this<00:06:06.440> is<00:06:06.560> my

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
whenever you do these events this is my

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.740 
whenever you do these events this is my
stuff<00:06:06.950> you're<00:06:07.070> looking<00:06:07.310> at<00:06:07.430> here<00:06:07.700> and<00:06:07.880> it's

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
stuff you're looking at here and it's

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.330 
stuff you're looking at here and it's
hard<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.140> camera<00:06:09.410> doesn't<00:06:09.560> focus<00:06:09.800> right<00:06:10.160> on

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
hard the camera doesn't focus right on

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.300 
hard the camera doesn't focus right on
the<00:06:10.550> images<00:06:10.880> but<00:06:11.120> their<00:06:11.510> band<00:06:11.780> trust<00:06:12.500> me<00:06:12.680> and

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
the images but their band trust me and

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.860 
the images but their band trust me and
but<00:06:13.790> I<00:06:13.820> think<00:06:14.060> whenever<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.390> do<00:06:14.479> adventure

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
but I think whenever you do adventure

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.150 
but I think whenever you do adventure
right<00:06:14.990> there<00:06:15.169> is<00:06:15.290> an<00:06:15.380> element<00:06:15.500> of<00:06:15.800> hit<00:06:15.979> or<00:06:16.010> miss

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
right there is an element of hit or miss
