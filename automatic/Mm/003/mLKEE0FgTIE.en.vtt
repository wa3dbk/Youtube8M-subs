time which is one of the main things and
the<00:00:29.099> speed<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> break<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:30.150> firm<00:00:30.390> but

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the speed of the break my firm but

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.849 
the speed of the break my firm but
aggressive<00:00:30.720> breaking<00:00:31.260> because<00:00:31.650> you'd

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
aggressive breaking because you'd

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
aggressive breaking because you'd
practiced<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.239> muck<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> up

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
practiced it so if they do muck it up

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020 
practiced it so if they do muck it up
you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.110> pull<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.440> over<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.800> go<00:00:34.980> okay<00:00:35.850> let's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you can pull them over and go okay let's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.250 
you can pull them over and go okay let's
just<00:00:36.149> practice<00:00:36.270> again<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> when<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
just practice again and when we do I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.380 
just practice again and when we do I
want<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.820> way<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.149> very

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
want to do like that that way it's very

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.490 
want to do like that that way it's very
different<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> plough<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.170> play<00:00:40.379> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
different to plough they will play on

on<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> nice<00:01:28.080> scenario<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:28.979> want

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
on not a nice scenario we don't want

on not a nice scenario we don't want
that<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.340> me<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.420> cannot<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.380> for

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that to me so I cannot really go for

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
that to me so I cannot really go for
that<00:01:31.650> we're<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> make<00:01:32.400> sure<00:01:32.729> because

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that we're going to make sure because

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.850 
that we're going to make sure because
remember<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> briefing<00:01:34.409> they've<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> get

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
remember on the briefing they've you get

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
remember on the briefing they've you get
fifty<00:01:35.340> percent<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> move<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.810> will

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
fifty percent when you move and it will

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
fifty percent when you move and it will
be<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.259> fifty<00:01:37.590> percent<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.070> guarantee<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
be that fifty percent I guarantee you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
be that fifty percent I guarantee you
that<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.900> put<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.350> into<00:01:40.470> place

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that so I'm going to put that into place

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
that so I'm going to put that into place
to<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.159> sure<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.460> doesn't<00:01:41.490> happen<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.720> can

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to make sure that doesn't happen you can

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.420 
to make sure that doesn't happen you can
then<00:01:42.990> fiddle<00:01:43.350> around<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.189> say

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
then fiddle around with what you say

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.859 
then fiddle around with what you say
according<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.180> house<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.720> they

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
according to what house you think they

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.109 
according to what house you think they
may<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.350> depend<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.159> how<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> drive<00:01:47.610> rom<00:01:47.909> when

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
may do depend on how to drive rom when

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.280 
may do depend on how to drive rom when
etc<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.570> I'll<00:01:48.689> give<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> couple<00:01:49.140> examples

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
etc so I'll give you a couple examples

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.929 
etc so I'll give you a couple examples
you<00:01:49.799> wouldn't<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> examples<00:01:50.820> but

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you wouldn't use all the examples but

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.060 
you wouldn't use all the examples but
you<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.659> could<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:52.079> bits<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> examples

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you you could use bits of the examples

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.940 
you you could use bits of the examples
but<00:01:53.159> you'll<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> idea<00:01:53.790> what<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.240> do

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950

the car wants black yeah so let's do

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.810 
the car wants black yeah so let's do
that<00:04:26.270> again<00:04:26.389> just<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.139> make<00:04:27.199> sure<00:04:27.639> now<00:04:28.639> you<00:04:28.699> can

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
that again just to make sure now you can

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.399 
that again just to make sure now you can
put<00:04:28.970> your<00:04:29.030> hand<00:04:29.210> on<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.389> handbrake<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:29.960> you

put your hand on the handbrake and you

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:37.810 
put your hand on the handbrake and you

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.320 

okay<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:40.580> quite<00:04:40.700> straightforward<00:04:40.940> but

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
okay so it's quite straightforward but

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.390 
okay so it's quite straightforward but
that<00:04:41.450> will<00:04:41.570> give<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.750> so<00:04:41.930> much<00:04:42.050> control<00:04:42.500> just

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
that will give you so much control just

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.980 
that will give you so much control just
a<00:04:43.490> few<00:04:43.610> more<00:04:43.790> tips<00:04:44.030> if<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> examiner<00:04:44.510> brakes

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
a few more tips if the examiner brakes

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.160 
a few more tips if the examiner brakes
too<00:04:45.170> hard<00:04:45.200> too<00:04:45.830> firm<00:04:46.360> then<00:04:47.360> do<00:04:47.720> another<00:04:47.810> pull

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
too hard too firm then do another pull

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.380 
too hard too firm then do another pull
over<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.440> do<00:04:48.560> another<00:04:48.650> dry<00:04:49.010> run<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:50.060> then<00:04:50.210> do

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
over and do another dry run and then do

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.910 
over and do another dry run and then do
targeted<00:04:50.900> practice<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.470> could<00:04:51.620> say<00:04:51.770> I'd

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
targeted practice so you could say I'd

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.620 
targeted practice so you could say I'd
like<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.370> next<00:04:53.000> time<00:04:53.090> we<00:04:53.180> did<00:04:53.360> we're<00:04:53.510> going

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
like you to next time we did we're going

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.150 
like you to next time we did we're going
to<00:04:53.690> hug<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.230> stop<00:04:54.410> by<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.560> green<00:04:54.890> car

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
to hug you to stop by the green car

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.430 
to hug you to stop by the green car
don't<00:04:55.580> stop<00:04:55.850> before<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.210> green<00:04:56.480> car<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:56.960> if

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
don't stop before the green car and if

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.380 
don't stop before the green car and if
they<00:04:57.560> break<00:04:57.740> too<00:04:57.950> soft<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.760> other<00:04:58.910> way<00:04:59.090> but

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
they break too soft the other way but

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.850 
they break too soft the other way but
the<00:04:59.510> same<00:04:59.720> technique<00:05:00.140> I'm<00:05:00.290> going<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.470> stop<00:05:00.770> by

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
the same technique I'm going to stop by

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.470 
the same technique I'm going to stop by
the<00:05:00.890> green<00:05:01.160> car<00:05:01.340> make<00:05:01.880> sure<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.120> stop<00:05:02.330> on<00:05:02.420> the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
the green car make sure you stop on the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.720 
the green car make sure you stop on the
green<00:05:02.630> car<00:05:02.840> not<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:02.990> blue<00:05:03.200> car<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.920> then<00:05:04.250> just

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
green car not the blue car and then just

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.160 
green car not the blue car and then just
so<00:05:04.880> we're<00:05:05.240> going<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.450> pretend<00:05:05.720> the<00:05:05.840> kids<00:05:06.020> run

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
so we're going to pretend the kids run

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.050 
so we're going to pretend the kids run
out<00:05:06.320> between<00:05:06.440> those<00:05:06.710> two<00:05:06.890> cars<00:05:07.190> up<00:05:07.370> there<00:05:07.580> as

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
out between those two cars up there as

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.610 
out between those two cars up there as
long<00:05:08.210> as<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:08.420> time<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.930> right<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.320> you<00:05:09.440> need

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
long as you time it right and you need

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.830 
long as you time it right and you need
to<00:05:09.740> know<00:05:09.770> how<00:05:10.040> long<00:05:10.370> your<00:05:11.060> car<00:05:11.240> takes<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.660> stop

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
to know how long your car takes to stop

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.510 
to know how long your car takes to stop
at<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.080> given<00:05:12.320> speed<00:05:12.620> you'll<00:05:13.280> need<00:05:13.430> to

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
at the given speed you'll need to

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.490 
at the given speed you'll need to
practice<00:05:13.880> that<00:05:13.910> then<00:05:14.450> they've<00:05:14.660> sort<00:05:15.470> of

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
practice that then they've sort of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.020 
practice that then they've sort of
forced<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.860> do<00:05:15.980> it<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:16.280> you<00:05:16.370> can<00:05:16.520> they're<00:05:16.970> not

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
forced to do it and you can they're not

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.550 
forced to do it and you can they're not
breaking<00:05:17.240> firm<00:05:17.570> enough<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:17.960> also<00:05:18.110> harder

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
breaking firm enough you can also harder

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.720 
breaking firm enough you can also harder
harder<00:05:18.740> harder<00:05:18.800> anyway<00:05:19.250> he'll<00:05:19.370> firma<00:05:19.640> firma

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
harder harder anyway he'll firma firma

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.850 
harder harder anyway he'll firma firma
grandma<00:05:20.270> that's<00:05:20.450> that's<00:05:20.720> not<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.930> problem<00:05:21.170> but

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
grandma that's that's not a problem but

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.410 
grandma that's that's not a problem but
used<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.190> dry<00:05:22.370> run<00:05:22.550> pull<00:05:22.790> away<00:05:22.880> with<00:05:23.120> drawn<00:05:23.300> on

used to dry run pull away with drawn on

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.560 
used to dry run pull away with drawn on
it<00:05:23.480> again<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:23.930> then<00:05:24.140> go<00:05:24.320> out<00:05:24.440> practice<00:05:24.620> it<00:05:25.570> one

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
it again and then go out practice it one

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.960 
it again and then go out practice it one
of<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.750> crucial<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.380> mostly<00:05:27.710> most<00:05:28.580> common

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
of the crucial and mostly most common

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.570 
of the crucial and mostly most common
failures<00:05:29.390> on<00:05:29.540> this<00:05:29.720> is<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.110> observation

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
failures on this is the observation

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.860 
failures on this is the observation
might<00:05:31.580> looking<00:05:31.910> around<00:05:32.150> not<00:05:32.450> looking<00:05:32.690> around

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
might looking around not looking around

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.810 
might looking around not looking around
hence<00:05:33.170> why<00:05:33.380> I<00:05:33.410> said<00:05:33.650> pace<00:05:34.340> out<00:05:34.550> there's<00:05:34.700> no

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
hence why I said pace out there's no

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.340 
hence why I said pace out there's no
more<00:05:35.000> key<00:05:35.360> hands<00:05:35.690> on<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.840> steering<00:05:36.050> wheel<00:05:36.170> he

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
more key hands on the steering wheel he

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.690 
more key hands on the steering wheel he
cannot<00:05:36.590> put<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.800> handbrake<00:05:37.070> down<00:05:37.340> his<00:05:37.520> hands

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
cannot put the handbrake down his hands

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.130 
cannot put the handbrake down his hands
on<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:37.910> steering<00:05:38.060> wheel<00:05:38.180> therefore<00:05:39.080> you

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
on the steering wheel therefore you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.200 
on the steering wheel therefore you
cannot<00:05:39.350> pull<00:05:39.560> away<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:40.460> it<00:05:40.520> is<00:05:40.640> important

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
cannot pull away so it is important
