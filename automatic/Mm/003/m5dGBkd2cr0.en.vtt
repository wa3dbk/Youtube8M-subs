00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.339 
and you have to walk the long way then
it<00:06:53.399> can<00:06:53.610> take<00:06:53.879> a<00:06:53.939> little<00:06:54.209> bit<00:06:54.419> to<00:06:54.629> get<00:06:54.779> back<00:06:54.839> and

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349 
it can take a little bit to get back and

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.679 
it can take a little bit to get back and
it<00:06:55.499> might<00:06:55.679> not<00:06:55.829> be<00:06:55.889> worth<00:06:56.159> your<00:06:56.369> time<00:06:56.689> because

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689
