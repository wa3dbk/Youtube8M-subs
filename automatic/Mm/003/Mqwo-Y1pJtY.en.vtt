tight enough I have a big head yet I do
have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> big<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.050> needed<00:01:01.500> something<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
have a big so I needed something that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.910 
have a big so I needed something that
day<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.660> works<00:01:03.899> well<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:04.530> he<00:01:04.769> has<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
day but it works well because he has the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800 
day but it works well because he has the
two<00:01:05.280> clips<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.820> front<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> best

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
two clips in front and one of the best

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
two clips in front and one of the best
so<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.830> why<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.090> says<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so that's why I like it now it says you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260 
so that's why I like it now it says you
could<00:01:09.630> curl<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.439> 400<00:01:10.920> degrees<00:01:11.270> but

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
could curl this up to 400 degrees but

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.240 
could curl this up to 400 degrees but
why<00:01:12.420> would<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.720> want<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> probably<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.439> it's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
why would you want to probably it it's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
why would you want to probably it it's
curly<00:01:14.790> already<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> good<00:01:16.530> thing

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
curly already and that's the good thing

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280

she<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:20.090> much<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.570> longer<00:01:22.909> but

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
she would be much more and longer but

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.990 
she would be much more and longer but
it's<00:01:24.090> okay<00:01:24.509> because<00:01:25.009> it's<00:01:26.009> summer<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000

like this I put it to the side and I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.840 
like this I put it to the side and I
rocked<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.649> F<00:02:01.950> 237

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
rocked it that way and I like the F 237

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.180 
rocked it that way and I like the F 237
because<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> does<00:02:03.390> have

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
because it does have

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.340 
because it does have
low<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.340> at<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.880> bottom<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.480> then<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.110> color

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
