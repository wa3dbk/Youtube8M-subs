in our medium we also take on bespoke

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.589 
in our medium we also take on bespoke
work<00:00:13.589> so<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.009> also<00:00:14.160> work<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.670> lot<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
work so we also work with a lot of the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.600 
work so we also work with a lot of the
leading<00:00:15.929> artists<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:16.980> also<00:00:17.130> publish

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
leading artists and then we also publish

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.510 
leading artists and then we also publish
work<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> artists<00:00:19.050> artisan<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.400> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
work with the artists artisan is one of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.939 
work with the artists artisan is one of
the<00:00:20.640> best<00:00:21.080> printmaking<00:00:22.080> workshops<00:00:22.740> around

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the best printmaking workshops around

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.080 
the best printmaking workshops around
it's<00:00:23.789> open<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.810> friendly<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.880> work

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's open it's friendly and the work

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's open it's friendly and the work
they<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> very<00:00:28.349> high<00:00:28.740> quality<00:00:29.130> indeed

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
they do is of a very high quality indeed

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970 
they do is of a very high quality indeed
it's<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> bit<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.539> stenciling<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.529> screen

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it's a bit like stenciling a screen

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.800 
it's a bit like stenciling a screen
printing<00:00:32.400> it's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> similar<00:00:33.060> sort<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
printing it's a similar sort of thing so

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.140 
printing it's a similar sort of thing so
you're<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.700> you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> mesh

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
you're actually you have a mesh

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.140 
you're actually you have a mesh
tensioned<00:00:36.690> across<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.080> frame<00:00:37.670> ink<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.880> pushed

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
tensioned across the frame ink is pushed

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.390 
tensioned across the frame ink is pushed
through<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.480> mesh<00:00:39.990> in<00:00:40.290> open<00:00:40.740> areas<00:00:41.130> and

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
through that mesh in open areas and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.660 
through that mesh in open areas and
released<00:00:42.030> onto<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> paper<00:00:43.440> below<00:00:43.830> each<00:00:44.190> artist

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
released onto a paper below each artist

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400 
released onto a paper below each artist
again<00:00:45.060> will<00:00:45.270> work<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:45.870> individual

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
again will work in a very individual

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.220 
again will work in a very individual
manner<00:00:46.620> some<00:00:47.310> come<00:00:47.580> with<00:00:47.610> plans<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.990> come

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
manner some come with plans some come

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.360 
manner some come with plans some come
literally<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.770> come<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.190> color

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
literally just come with some color

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.740 
literally just come with some color
swatches<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> whole<00:00:51.390> thing<00:00:51.450> as

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
swatches and we make the whole thing as

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.950 
swatches and we make the whole thing as
we<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:51.990> along<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.530> turned<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.960> diagram

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
we go along I turned up with a diagram

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
we go along I turned up with a diagram
and<00:00:55.380> three<00:00:55.740> separate<00:00:56.250> drawings<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.300> my

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and three separate drawings from my

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
and three separate drawings from my
sketchbook<00:00:57.870> all<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.320> black<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> white<00:00:58.830> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
sketchbook all in black and white and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.460 
sketchbook all in black and white and
the<00:00:59.520> color<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.970> somehow<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.510> head<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.290> we

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
the color was somehow in my head and we

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.140 
the color was somehow in my head and we
put<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.770> together<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.310> sometimes<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> works

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
put it together and sometimes it works

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
put it together and sometimes it works
and<00:01:03.300> sometimes<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.810> doesn't

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and sometimes it doesn't

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.120 
and sometimes it doesn't
moving<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.860> Harvey's<00:01:05.450> sketch<00:01:06.890> all<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
moving all from Harvey's sketch all the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670 
moving all from Harvey's sketch all the
work<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:08.910> separated<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.870> individual

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
work is then separated into individual

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.180 
work is then separated into individual
colors<00:01:11.930> which<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.050> put<00:01:13.200> onto<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.500> transparent

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
colors which are put onto a transparent

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.240 
colors which are put onto a transparent
film<00:01:16.940> bright<00:01:17.940> blue<00:01:18.350> once<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.500> got<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:19.800> idea<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
film bright blue once we got an idea of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.450 
film bright blue once we got an idea of
where<00:01:20.400> we're<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:21.200> we'll<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.100> artwork

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
where we're going we'll the artwork

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.300 
where we're going we'll the artwork
would<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.760> made<00:01:23.970> usually<00:01:24.900> by<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.230> artist<00:01:25.710> will

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
would be made usually by the artist will

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.540 
would be made usually by the artist will
then<00:01:26.550> transfer<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.480> artwork<00:01:27.810> onto<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.200> screen

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
then transfer the artwork onto a screen

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.550 
then transfer the artwork onto a screen
we'll<00:01:29.550> mix<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.910> colors<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.570> proof<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.350> down

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we'll mix the colors and proof that down

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.050 
we'll mix the colors and proof that down
onto<00:01:31.740> paper<00:01:32.010> at<00:01:32.250> which<00:01:32.400> point<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.730> artist

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
onto paper at which point the artist

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.970 
onto paper at which point the artist
decides<00:01:33.420> whether<00:01:33.690> that's<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.620> not

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
decides whether that's right or not

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.130 
decides whether that's right or not
right<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.630> next<00:01:36.870> color

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
right we then go on to the next color

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
right we then go on to the next color
and<00:01:37.440> each<00:01:37.530> color<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:38.040> individually<00:01:38.670> layered

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and each color is individually layered

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
and each color is individually layered
so<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:39.870> can<00:01:40.050> be<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.230> simple<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.800> one<00:01:40.950> color<00:01:41.190> or

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so it can be as simple as a one color or

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.990 
so it can be as simple as a one color or
as<00:01:42.180> complex<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.720> 3040<00:01:43.380> colors<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.400> too

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
as complex as 3040 colors it was too

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.149 
as complex as 3040 colors it was too
light<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> initial<00:01:45.960> proof<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.010> we

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
light on the initial proof so then we

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:47.770 
light on the initial proof so then we
added<00:01:47.310> more

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
added more

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.840 
added more
an<00:01:47.960> oil-based<00:01:48.320> pigment<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:49.310> get<00:01:49.490> up<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.729> this

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
an oil-based pigment to get up to this

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.300 
an oil-based pigment to get up to this
stronger<00:01:50.210> blue<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.080> that's<00:01:51.320> now<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:52.070> color

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
stronger blue so that's now the color

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.090 
stronger blue so that's now the color
that's<00:01:52.490> been<00:01:52.760> additions<00:01:53.270> because<00:01:54.049> we<00:01:54.380> we<00:01:54.890> work

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
that's been additions because we we work

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.340 
that's been additions because we we work
with<00:01:55.310> only<00:01:55.640> original<00:01:56.119> printmaking<00:01:56.509> every

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
with only original printmaking every

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
time a piece is created you don't

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.260 
time a piece is created you don't
actually<00:01:59.570> know<00:01:59.900> until<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.950> finish<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.820> what

you don't actually know until you get to
the<00:02:12.500> final<00:02:13.069> piece<00:02:13.310> what<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.330> going<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.510> be

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
the final piece what it's going to be

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.270 
the final piece what it's going to be
like<00:02:14.780> how<00:02:14.989> many<00:02:15.140> colors<00:02:15.440> are<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.860> use<00:02:16.069> or

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
like how many colors are going to use or

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.680 
like how many colors are going to use or
and<00:02:16.400> how<00:02:16.550> long<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.819> will<00:02:16.910> take<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.390> were<00:02:17.480> saying

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and how long it will take we were saying

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.270 
and how long it will take we were saying
we'd<00:02:17.870> originally<00:02:18.050> discussed<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.830> pieces

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
we'd originally discussed the pieces

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.080 
we'd originally discussed the pieces
having<00:02:19.670> many<00:02:19.850> 10<00:02:20.120> colors<00:02:21.940> we've<00:02:22.940> actually

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
having many 10 colors we've actually

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.440 
having many 10 colors we've actually
done<00:02:23.360> 8<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.350> far<00:02:24.850> maybe<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.970> little<00:02:26.150> need

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
done 8 so far maybe a little need

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.820 
done 8 so far maybe a little need
something<00:02:26.810> else<00:02:26.959> maybe<00:02:27.200> things<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.530> want<00:02:27.739> to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
something else maybe things that want to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.770 
something else maybe things that want to
come<00:02:27.920> out<00:02:28.100> maybe<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:29.030> will<00:02:29.120> make<00:02:29.269> new<00:02:29.450> screens

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
come out maybe we will make new screens

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.540 
come out maybe we will make new screens
to<00:02:29.959> go<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.230> because<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.920> making<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.370> new

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
to go in because it is making a new

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.590 
to go in because it is making a new
piece<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.790> work<00:02:32.090> that's<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.630> whole<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:35.450> whole

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
piece of work that's the whole the whole

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.509 
piece of work that's the whole the whole
part<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.140> original<00:02:36.350> printmaking<00:02:37.069> as

part of the original printmaking as
opposed<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.410> reproducing<00:02:39.410> where<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.860> input

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
opposed to reproducing where the input

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.160 
opposed to reproducing where the input
of<00:02:40.340> other<00:02:40.610> people<00:02:41.120> makes<00:02:41.600> an<00:02:41.780> enormous

we're gonna need to address that as
another<00:03:17.900> separate<00:03:18.590> process<00:03:18.890> we're<00:03:19.010> also

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
another separate process we're also

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.130

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
onto a piece of film that we can

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.729 
onto a piece of film that we can
translate<00:03:28.609> onto<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.450> screen<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:30.470> we're<00:03:30.620> now

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.370 
translate onto a screen and so we're now
doing<00:03:30.799> very<00:03:31.190> short<00:03:31.430> runs<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:32.120> his<00:03:32.840> work<00:03:33.049> and

doing very short runs of his work and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.170 
doing very short runs of his work and
it's<00:03:33.609> remarkable<00:03:34.609> how<00:03:34.790> many<00:03:34.970> different
