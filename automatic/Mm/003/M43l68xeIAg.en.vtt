00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.420
 entrepreneur I'm going to start analyzing is 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:19.279
 that really is improvising important 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:19.279
 in what is being done 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.080
 the combats of culture although real 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 being at the height I do not lie you have to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.019
 be to save from increment because 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.300
 I 'm not going to put these four 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.140
 only the mouse and elements concerned 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.450
 skateboard 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.219
 Now people tell me and it's complete 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.480
 I have why why or why am I 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.010
 sick but it is clear that it is his 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.780
 for a dad is not better and is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 pending there the plan of arias also 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.920
 is up so I do not laugh 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 whereas in this one as I do not have a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.730
 book if back and sing all the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.739
 weeks are darÃ­o and if then 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 also that is to which rafael is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.129
 fix view that the controls for the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.500
 to be clear that we do not have this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.950
 Worse but no one feeling are many 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.210
 the flavors for us 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.550
 throwing the box thank you very much for the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.800
 invitation the patient who does work in 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.510
 the station at all hours is that it is 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.290
 clear that an agent never gives many 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 good these computers 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.240
 on keyboards 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.920
 the chantal crystal is falling in 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.050
 the bars to understand that we are not 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 Disguises of passes that come clear 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.369
 I'm on the street or very patience 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.820
 for the ride she saw a joke or 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:02:08.190
 that's why I'm alone but why not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:08.190
 is sure unemployment 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.250
 I come from there a while in the neighborhood 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.810
 only what they used me for neighborhood 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.730
 bolivar for all those people who are 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.110

 I have the reflexes to you I talk to you it was not 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.290
 which of course remains representing 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.760
 I speak here in the camera and the stick 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.950
 launches in the background morgan the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.230
 improvisation to become a 2 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.849
 so I am let's take it clear that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.319
 does not have a position that we all go 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.030
 to leave 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.200
