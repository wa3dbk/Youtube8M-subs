00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.179
 hello new here I bring you a new 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.760
 tutorial and in this case it 's another look no 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.559
 maker I already made one on the channel and this 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.230
 I went up on instagram that one day I did it and 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.900
 all of you asked me to do it 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.259
 for the theme of ideas to get to 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.640
 instituto and others but good either 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.339
 bigger story but like what you gave 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.699
 here it is and nothing if you are interested in this 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.520
 kind of lukas without type almost too little 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.050
 makeup I hope I wanted to see you what 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600
 first and most important we will have 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.610
 hydrated well our face cleaned 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.860
 Hydrated more water and now good 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.900
 we are going to apply a product to 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.390
 unify the tone can be a showcase 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.130
 as in this case I use a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.930
 moisturizer with color and if not 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.910
 you both have to mix a little bit of 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.980
 moisturizing cream spoon with a little 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.290
 makeup base and is as a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.820
 moisturizer with color so the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.950
 we are applying for the face I 'm going 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.400
 to do with the hands to do it more 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.400
 Quick 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.930
 depending on the coverage that 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.860
 we want you can use a product 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.410
 or another but like this video I want it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.120
 focus also for the girls that 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.910
 go to school and other good I want 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.630
 use my makeup base or anything 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.630
 have a lot of coverage 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.780
 because no good 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.440
 I do not see what it takes first for the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.500
 school that many do not let go 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.159
 make up at school 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.140
 to the institute or whatever 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.700
 and now we're going to finish correcting 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.399
 some imperfection that we have with a 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.469
 let's say soft corrector is worth not one of 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.270
 super coverage or others but something more 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.270
 ligerito is to use the mineral of sea 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.939
 and the stores also with your fingers 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.800
 good for the others I will use 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.440
 shadows but I will use as a 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.480
 prebase or a shadow in cream that is 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.820
 same the tone of the eyelid because like me 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.310
 I have it quite dark and I can 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.990
 use how to use a pencil I will 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.720
 use a test is next 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.370
 I organdy cake that they say does not equal the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.470
 tone to the eyelid but to me 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.420
 neutralizes a tiny bit of 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.420
 nothing dark 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.760
 a touch nothing but that is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.450
 making small cuts in videos for 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 make it a bit more agile but this one 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.760
 then it takes very little and good 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.299
 well once we're done , we could 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.129
 nuance the face if we want to even 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.319
 with the same translucent powders can 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.420
 seal the test only the shadows on 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.040
 cream that we have put and now good 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.370
 let's move on to the eyes I will use 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.049
 this was illuminator of deliplus ideals 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.160
 how to avoid shadows that stand out 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:20.150
 some areas of the face as in a 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.150
 more than anything from the eyes 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.459
 the arch of the eyebrow 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.060
 and the inner part 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:42.520
 and good with a brown pencil I will draw 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.520
 a small line following the tab 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.090
 and as the little one thinks, I'm going to 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.090
 blur it a little 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.750
 and a little bit from the outside of the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.750
 small and inferior 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.239
 to make them bigger we can 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.769
 use the same illuminator used 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.870
 before but you should use this pencil 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.260
 eyes of sephora which is a call in color 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.260
 meat 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.749
 and this well in the morning it comes very well 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.760
 less tired more to more awake 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.580
 and now another super important step is the 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.180
 mask I'm going to use this more than 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.039
 it's not black it's black brown so 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.500
 look more natural we can curl the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.710
 eyelashes if we want to either taste 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.710
 personal 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.830
 and well we are going to make up the face 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.860
 I'm going to define a little with the balls 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.780
 benefit of this step also if I am very 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.780
 young lady, you can do it 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.210
 and what I 'm going to do is with a brush 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.240
 to blur was not going to use shadows but 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.210
 I can take a bit of the outline of 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.930
 lobe itself and spend a little with the 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.930
 basin vale 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.410
 just to make something something of 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.430
 color and now I'm going to use a blusher 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.889
 in the fine port of veins type cream 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.260
 normally only pull for daily 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.190
 type cream 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.800
 because they last a little longer 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.110
 and to understand it much faster for 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.180
 my taste more comfortable and apart for 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.670
 touch up if I want I put it in my bag 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.990
 and I do not need to be taking me 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.990
 brush or 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.769
 I could leave the look like that, I'm going to 

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:38.159
 use a little illuminator this 

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:40.199
 of m &amp; m a few taps of anything and in addition 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:42.619
 be very golden so that it is more 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.619
 natural 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.590
 they need their habitat 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.710
 and finally the lips use this 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.470
 fashionable lipstick which is in the 7 tone that 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.240
 is this tone a very soft tone very 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.540
 natural for every day I like 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.540
 much 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:15.620
 here you have my look for every day 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.180
 so it's very very natural and good 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.580
 we do not see each other a bit more cute and not 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.259
 we counted to the face of the morning that nothing 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.780
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.780
 see you in the next see you later
