bonnet you'll see here's the headlight

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.370 
bonnet you'll see here's the headlight
assembly<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.430> instead<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.360> having<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.750> reach

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
assembly and instead of having to reach

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.260 
assembly and instead of having to reach
in<00:01:23.649> which<00:01:23.950> had<00:01:24.189> an<00:01:24.369> old<00:01:24.520> car<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:24.939> having<00:01:25.210> to

screws<00:01:32.890> there<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.430> also<00:01:33.850> it's<00:01:34.299> just<00:01:34.329> kind<00:01:34.659> of

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
screws there and also it's just kind of

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:42.210 
screws there and also it's just kind of
cool<00:01:35.549> seeing<00:01:36.549> here

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:02:05.870 

and<00:01:42.880> let<00:01:43.150> their<00:02:00.600> loosen<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.690> up<00:02:01.810> they're

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:26.480 

pretty<00:02:06.880> sure<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.540> can<00:02:07.690> just<00:02:07.840> go<00:02:07.990> there<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.250 

see<00:02:27.490> how<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.700> then<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.690> kind<00:02:28.960> of<00:02:29.020> pops

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
see how that then that just kind of pops

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.510 
see how that then that just kind of pops
off<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:29.740> we'd<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.160> worry<00:02:30.310> about<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
off there we'd have to worry about a

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:52.260 
off there we'd have to worry about a
slider<00:02:30.850> doc<00:02:31.230> keep<00:02:32.230> these<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:52.000> there

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
slider doc keep these on right there

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.470 
slider doc keep these on right there
nice<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.540> easy<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.989> get<00:02:53.140> in<00:02:53.790> okay<00:02:54.790> now<00:02:55.180> we<00:02:55.239> can

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
nice and easy to get in okay now we can

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.600 
nice and easy to get in okay now we can
here's<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.810> cap<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.190> want<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.430> take

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
here's the cap you just want to take

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:07.140 
here's the cap you just want to take
that<00:02:58.110> off<00:03:00.690> look<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.620> see<00:03:06.150> hooked

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
that off look in and you can see hooked

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:25.590 
that off look in and you can see hooked
up<00:03:07.360> here<00:03:21.480> comes<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.660> ball<00:03:23.070> see<00:03:24.330> like<00:03:25.330> there's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
up here comes the ball see like there's

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.190 
up here comes the ball see like there's
a<00:03:25.750> little<00:03:25.930> burnt

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
a little burnt

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.110 
a little burnt
so<00:03:28.040> that's<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.460> that's<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.910> one<00:03:30.550> we<00:03:31.550> got<00:03:31.700> next

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
so that's the that's the one we got next

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.050 
so that's the that's the one we got next
just<00:03:32.330> remove<00:03:32.890> them<00:03:33.890> off<00:03:36.400> now<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.700> part<00:03:37.970> is

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
just remove them off now this is part is

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.300 
just remove them off now this is part is
important<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:38.780> was<00:03:38.959> told<00:03:39.170> not<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.680> touch<00:03:40.040> the

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
important I was told not to touch the

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.150 
important I was told not to touch the
glass<00:03:40.520> because<00:03:41.240> of<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.390> high<00:03:41.510> temperature

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
glass because of the high temperature

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.330 
glass because of the high temperature
the<00:03:43.160> acid<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:43.880> guess<00:03:44.470> when<00:03:45.470> your<00:03:45.590> fingers<00:03:45.980> can

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
the acid I guess when your fingers can

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.670 
the acid I guess when your fingers can
compromise<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.780> strength<00:03:48.050> of<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.470> bulb

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
compromise this the strength of the bulb

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.800 
compromise this the strength of the bulb
so<00:03:48.770> I<00:03:49.220> never<00:03:49.490> touched<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.910> glass<00:03:50.060> part<00:03:50.450> just

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
so I never touched the glass part just

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:00.000 
so I never touched the glass part just
hold<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.200> metal<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:54.290> then<00:03:54.410> place<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:56.050> into

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.010
