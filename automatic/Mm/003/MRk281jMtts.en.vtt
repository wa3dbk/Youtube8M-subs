00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:16.990
 Y 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:20.210
 and there's the ritz in minecraft 12w 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.680
 34th and one more week 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.410
 moyano brings us a small 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.060
 update that every time we 're 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.880
 getting closer to minecraft 1.3 but as 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.739
 have been a very busy week 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.800
 because it has already changed their office and 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.290
 good they uploaded some photos to twitter 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.930
 we make excuses excuses to work 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.130
 less but good that there is a new 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 snapshot so let's see 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.560
 that considering this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.020
 and I had put the bow here for 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.800
 make the law and here's the ritz in 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.760
 minecraft but of course I have started in the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.320
 menu and good as you see the protagonist 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.310
 is the leander chest you see 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.550
 apparently there is no change 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 radical but now you will see that yes 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.719
 that there is a quite important change 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.310
 but before teaching the new one consider 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.570
 from sender chest 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.060
 tell you that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.850
 at sea when you make a mac 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.610
 I do not know if any of you have 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.880
 a mac well then the pac button 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.340
 textures no 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.289
 it did not work for functions have 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.119
 arranged that vessel is good for the 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.119
 otherwise it would be quite important 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.690
 and then the other thing would be that if 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.690
 press ty and put the command speak 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.460
 A) Yes 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.700
 we would appear 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.540
 and a server appeared to them a host 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.840
 then we could do 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.630
 a small server plan to play with 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.350
 your friends and the truth that is quite 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.730
 well then it would be put public bar 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.610
 very public not public and would disappear 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.180
 and I'm going to go down this block road 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.629
 golden here I will catch this outbreak and what 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.060
 I'm going to shoot because you give me disgust 9 here 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.240
 is throwing a table internment 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.330
 back with many diamond spikes 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.540
 and there is no new change as you can 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.810
 observe this they have left it like this 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.180
 I 'm going to try to get a 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.180
 enchantment and this accelerated so far 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.380
 Well, I have struggled to get it 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.380
 but I already have my enchantment 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.969
 and now I 'm going to give way to yes 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.310
 I get out of here 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.319
 If I can get out of here, I have already left 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.530
 I'm going to show you the new justice of 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.980
 those in derch is so I'm going to put the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.980
 game mode 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.030
 in your rival and we're going to put here by 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.170
 example all these armies of 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.030
 diamond that the truth is one that 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.870
 that it would not be bad to have it for 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.170
 example this 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.790
 This will also be very cool 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:01.489
 is irrelevant then it seems if 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:03.409
 you see that I have it tripled and good 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.049
 what happens if there were another 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.390
 player then I would not see this now 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.329
 each player has his own gift eppes 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.489
 It is or whether we have a common chest under me 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.530
 I mean a block a single one sell 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.150
 chest but on the right I was going to have his 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.919
 space and I give equal rights 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.580
 enemies of diamond peaks because I 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.949
 I am rich there are meerits I am the rich mc and the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.990
 he is not the ritz then he is not rich not 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.389
 have diamonds, you have me 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:34.210
 understood and the other super change 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.210
 important is that when we prick 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.930
 Oh God 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.250
 has given us 82 although it is good 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.650
 I really appreciate it 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.620
 although the other one was cool to come out 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.710
 directly the leander chest is 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.770
 salgado 82 and targets 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.840
 is going to make you play with more 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.240
 intelligence so to speak you have to 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.890
 save that eye from ender because the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.640
 oxidizing the lose but the eye sell 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.230
 field 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.970
 then or you have a stack of eyes 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:08.009
 Ender and you are going to pose things in 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.050
 the trunk you picas and you do it again 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.080
 or you have to think the exact moment 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.419
 when using the leander chest and the other 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.360
 cosilla is that it consists we are going to sting 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:23.860
 one and as you see here 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:29.080
 here we would take enders est 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:32.909
 and nothing this would be all that the main thing 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.580
 has been the new command bar publix and 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.930
 the snet c'est 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.710
 and well then some 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.590
 pequeÃ±ajo change if I discover any 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.270
 change I will put it in the description or in 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.330
 an annotation during the video so that 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.759
 Stay tuned for example if you see it today 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.520
 Well tomorrow looking in case there is something just 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.650
 just in case I do not know if there will be something else and 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.539
 the typical little bugs that nobody gets 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.550
 whole and they have fixed and nothing I hope 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.600
 that you liked this review of the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.270
 a-12 w 24 a in this beloved tree and what 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.340
 it seems to you if he hurt himself that I do not know 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:16.199
 what have you asked me to say goodbye 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.199
 so up another 360 360 editor 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.430
 until another
