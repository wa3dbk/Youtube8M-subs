personally<00:01:30.750> used<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.500> thing<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.950> miles

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
personally used this thing was miles

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.460 
personally used this thing was miles
ahead<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> anything<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> market<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.990> it's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
ahead of anything on the market and it's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
ahead of anything on the market and it's
still<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.100> day<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.520> irrelevant

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
still to this day is irrelevant

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
still to this day is irrelevant
there's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> reason<00:01:36.600> Apple<00:01:37.110> continued<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.650> sell

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
there's a reason Apple continued to sell

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.550 
there's a reason Apple continued to sell
these<00:01:37.979> long<00:01:38.400> after<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> iPad<00:01:39.329> 3<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> iPad<00:01:40.259> 4

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
ever made

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
ever made
and<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> supports<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> latest<00:01:44.130> version<00:01:44.460> of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
actually a little bit heavier the funny

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240

next<00:03:04.450> for<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.810> next<00:03:05.050> iPad<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:05.710> are<00:03:05.770> they

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
next for the next iPad what are they

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.350 
next for the next iPad what are they
gonna<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.310> do<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.640> get<00:03:06.760> people<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.210> buy

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
gonna have to do to get people to buy

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.820 
gonna have to do to get people to buy
more<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.810> these<00:03:07.960> it<00:03:08.230> seems<00:03:08.470> like<00:03:08.650> they've

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
more of these it seems like they've

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.040 
more of these it seems like they've
reached<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.310> barrier<00:03:09.730> how<00:03:10.240> much<00:03:10.450> better<00:03:10.780> could

iPad Mini series so like the original
iPad<00:03:24.880> nobody<00:03:25.690> really<00:03:25.990> thought<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.410> one

a gap in the market with this medium
sized<00:03:31.000> iPad<00:03:31.300> so<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> very<00:03:32.080> first<00:03:32.260> one<00:03:32.620> was

generation<00:03:42.730> definitely<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> speed<00:03:43.930> bump<00:03:44.140> 1.3

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100

gigahertz<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.670> lot<00:03:45.910> more<00:03:46.060> capable<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.660> then

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
gigahertz a lot more capable and then

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.810 
gigahertz a lot more capable and then
the<00:03:47.200> third<00:03:47.410> generation<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:48.160> implemented<00:03:48.700> a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
the third generation just implemented a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.300 
the third generation just implemented a
touch<00:03:49.060> ID<00:03:49.300> sensor<00:03:49.420> really<00:03:50.350> nothing<00:03:50.920> new<00:03:51.130> the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
touch ID sensor really nothing new the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.699 
touch ID sensor really nothing new the
specs<00:03:51.640> were<00:03:51.970> almost<00:03:52.330> exactly<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.200> same<00:03:53.410> as

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
specs were almost exactly the same as

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.830

the<00:03:54.010> iPad<00:03:54.430> Mini<00:03:54.670> 2<00:03:54.880> alright<00:03:55.330> now<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.600> we've

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
the iPad Mini 2 alright now that we've

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.510 
the iPad Mini 2 alright now that we've
finished<00:03:56.020> our<00:03:56.260> little<00:03:56.410> history<00:03:56.920> lesson<00:03:56.950> let's

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
finished our little history lesson let's

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.520 
finished our little history lesson let's
go<00:03:57.640> ahead<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.090> compare<00:03:58.450> all<00:03:58.630> these<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.050> see

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
go ahead and compare all these and see

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.199 
go ahead and compare all these and see
how<00:03:59.770> they've<00:03:59.980> changed<00:04:00.010> speed<00:04:01.000> wise

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
how they've changed speed wise

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.510 
how they've changed speed wise
throughout<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.840> generations<00:04:02.410> ok<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:03.070> let's

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
throughout the generations ok so let's

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.460 
throughout the generations ok so let's
go<00:04:03.640> ahead<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:04.000> run<00:04:04.209> three<00:04:04.480> tests<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.140> startup

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
go ahead and run three tests a startup

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.310 
go ahead and run three tests a startup
test<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.980> Geekbench<00:04:06.550> any<00:04:06.850> Wi-Fi<00:04:07.390> speed<00:04:07.720> test<00:04:08.020> I

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
test a Geekbench any Wi-Fi speed test I

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.470 
test a Geekbench any Wi-Fi speed test I
gotta<00:04:08.560> tell<00:04:08.770> you<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.430> video<00:04:09.640> gets<00:04:10.030> harder

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
gotta tell you this video gets harder

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.420 
gotta tell you this video gets harder
and<00:04:10.600> harder<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:11.050> make<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.500> more<00:04:11.709> iPads<00:04:12.100> there

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
and harder to make the more iPads there

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.460 
and harder to make the more iPads there
are<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:13.060> I'm<00:04:13.300> not<00:04:13.630> looking<00:04:13.959> forward<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.260> next

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
are so I'm not looking forward to next

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.380 
are so I'm not looking forward to next
year<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.280> way<00:04:15.400> I've<00:04:15.550> got<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.850> set<00:04:16.030> up<00:04:16.209> is

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
year so the way I've got this set up is

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.820 
year so the way I've got this set up is
they're<00:04:16.600> all<00:04:16.810> connected<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.380> one<00:04:17.410> power

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
they're all connected to one power

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.460 
they're all connected to one power
source<00:04:18.190> just<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.820> multi<00:04:19.359> bank<00:04:19.720> charger<00:04:20.289> and

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
source just a multi bank charger and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.390 
source just a multi bank charger and
they're<00:04:21.190> all<00:04:21.340> being<00:04:21.520> powered<00:04:21.820> on<00:04:21.940> it

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
they're all being powered on it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.400 
they're all being powered on it
same<00:04:22.759> time<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.419> is<00:04:23.600> important<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.139> consider

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
same time it is important to consider

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.740 
same time it is important to consider
that<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.100> newer<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.490> device<00:04:25.759> the<00:04:26.120> more<00:04:26.360> has

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
that the newer the device the more has

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.780 
that the newer the device the more has
to<00:04:26.780> load<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.590> less<00:04:27.770> resources<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.490> has<00:04:28.520> to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
to load and the less resources it has to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.300 
to load and the less resources it has to
load<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.240> all<00:04:30.050> these<00:04:30.259> devices<00:04:30.800> except<00:04:31.130> for

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
load it and all these devices except for

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.529 
load it and all these devices except for
the<00:04:31.400> iPad<00:04:31.699> one<00:04:31.880> are<00:04:32.000> running<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.330> same

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
the iPad one are running the same

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.360 
the iPad one are running the same
firmware<00:04:32.990> that's<00:04:33.289> pretty<00:04:33.710> crazy

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
firmware that's pretty crazy

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.670

just<00:04:53.060> stay<00:04:53.479> off<00:04:53.509> okay<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:54.560> let's<00:04:54.949> go<00:04:55.070> ahead<00:04:55.100> and

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
just stay off okay so let's go ahead and

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.670 
just stay off okay so let's go ahead and
perform<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.820> Geekbench<00:04:56.330> now<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.660> iPad<00:04:56.870> air<00:04:57.289> one

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
perform a Geekbench now the iPad air one

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.140 
perform a Geekbench now the iPad air one
is<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.010> only<00:04:58.250> device<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.550> doesn't<00:04:59.030> support

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
is the only device that doesn't support

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.510 
is the only device that doesn't support
this<00:04:59.539> sadly<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:00.740> let's<00:05:01.010> go<00:05:01.100> ahead<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.370> run<00:05:01.490> it

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
this sadly so let's go ahead and run it

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.060 
this sadly so let's go ahead and run it
on<00:05:01.669> all<00:05:02.030> other<00:05:02.360> devices<00:05:02.449> and<00:05:03.139> so<00:05:03.500> results<00:05:03.949> are

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
on all other devices and so results are

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.010 
on all other devices and so results are
in<00:05:04.340> now<00:05:04.699> of<00:05:04.820> course<00:05:05.060> we<00:05:05.360> can<00:05:05.479> expect<00:05:05.810> high

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
in now of course we can expect high

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.529 
in now of course we can expect high
results<00:05:06.289> from<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.680> iPad<00:05:07.039> air<00:05:07.220> tube<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:08.240> me<00:05:08.389> all

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
results from the iPad air tube to me all

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.050 
results from the iPad air tube to me all
was<00:05:08.690> impressive<00:05:09.229> was<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.680> iPad<00:05:10.130> 2<00:05:10.550> was

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
was impressive was that the iPad 2 was

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.420 
was impressive was that the iPad 2 was
matching<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.900> results<00:05:12.380> of<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.530> iPad<00:05:12.860> 3<00:05:13.190> even

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
matching the results of the iPad 3 even

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.700 
matching the results of the iPad 3 even
though<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.910> processor<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:14.720> RAM<00:05:14.780> specs<00:05:15.470> are

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
though the processor and RAM specs are

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.650 
though the processor and RAM specs are
very<00:05:16.160> different<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.240> can<00:05:17.360> see<00:05:17.510> with

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
very different so as you can see with

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.210 
very different so as you can see with
this<00:05:17.780> Geekbench<00:05:18.229> there<00:05:18.530> is<00:05:18.650> definitely

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
this Geekbench there is definitely

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.790 
this Geekbench there is definitely
progression<00:05:20.000> from<00:05:20.449> all<00:05:20.750> devices<00:05:21.080> above<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
progression from all devices above the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.730 
progression from all devices above the
iPad<00:05:22.250> 3<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:22.970> mean<00:05:23.240> it's<00:05:23.660> really<00:05:24.110> impressive<00:05:24.470> how

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
iPad 3 I mean it's really impressive how

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.189 
iPad 3 I mean it's really impressive how
far<00:05:25.099> apples<00:05:25.520> come<00:05:25.820> since<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.300> original<00:05:26.810> iPad

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
far apples come since the original iPad

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.710 
far apples come since the original iPad
and<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.650> very<00:05:27.830> last<00:05:28.039> test<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.820> Wi-Fi<00:05:29.300> speed

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
and the very last test is a Wi-Fi speed

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.110 
and the very last test is a Wi-Fi speed
test<00:05:30.020> so<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.620> router<00:05:30.800> is<00:05:31.099> an<00:05:31.280> airport<00:05:31.639> extreme

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
test so the router is an airport extreme

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.670 
test so the router is an airport extreme
all<00:05:32.330> these<00:05:32.539> devices<00:05:32.810> are<00:05:33.110> hooked<00:05:33.320> up<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.530> it

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
all these devices are hooked up to it

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.110 
all these devices are hooked up to it
and<00:05:33.919> each<00:05:34.340> test<00:05:34.580> will<00:05:34.849> be<00:05:34.970> performed

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
and each test will be performed

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.750 
and each test will be performed
individually<00:05:35.660> now<00:05:36.260> here<00:05:36.470> are<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.680> results<00:05:37.580> as

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
individually now here are the results as

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.219 
individually now here are the results as
you<00:05:37.880> guys<00:05:38.000> can<00:05:38.180> see<00:05:38.240> there<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.810> not<00:05:39.050> much

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
you guys can see there is not much

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.870 
you guys can see there is not much
that's<00:05:39.409> change<00:05:39.830> in<00:05:40.039> between<00:05:40.159> every<00:05:40.580> single

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
that's change in between every single

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.000 
that's change in between every single
one<00:05:41.030> now<00:05:41.630> take<00:05:42.080> note<00:05:42.110> that's<00:05:42.590> because<00:05:42.860> my

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
one now take note that's because my

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.980 
one now take note that's because my
router<00:05:43.310> is<00:05:43.580> in<00:05:43.789> my<00:05:43.940> office<00:05:44.330> if<00:05:44.510> it<00:05:44.659> was<00:05:44.750> further

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
router is in my office if it was further

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.930 
router is in my office if it was further
away<00:05:45.229> there<00:05:45.710> would<00:05:45.860> definitely<00:05:45.889> be<00:05:46.460> more<00:05:46.760> of<00:05:46.880> a

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
away there would definitely be more of a

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.850 
away there would definitely be more of a
difference<00:05:47.360> as<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.780> technology<00:05:48.409> for<00:05:48.650> range

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
difference as the technology for range

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.460 
difference as the technology for range
does<00:05:49.159> increase<00:05:49.580> between<00:05:49.789> these<00:05:50.090> devices<00:05:50.470> ipad

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
does increase between these devices ipad

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.560 
does increase between these devices ipad
3<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:51.889> a<00:05:52.010> downgrade<00:05:52.280> like<00:05:52.849> always<00:05:53.180> because<00:05:53.449> it

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
3 is a downgrade like always because it

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.570 
3 is a downgrade like always because it
