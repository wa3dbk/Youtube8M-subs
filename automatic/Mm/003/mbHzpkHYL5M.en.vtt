that's what's remarkable is that they've

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.859

took a lot of the guys and their

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.440 
took a lot of the guys and their
characters<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.970> worked<00:01:36.970> off<00:01:37.150> of<00:01:37.180> their

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
characters and worked off of their

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.990 
characters and worked off of their
strengths<00:01:37.900> such<00:01:38.710> as<00:01:38.950> Ricky<00:01:39.310> Steamboat<00:01:39.520> doing

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
strengths such as Ricky Steamboat doing

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.210 
strengths such as Ricky Steamboat doing
stuff<00:01:40.270> off<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.630> top<00:01:40.810> rope<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.740> where<00:01:41.920> you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
stuff off the top rope to where you

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.760 
stuff off the top rope to where you
wouldn't<00:01:42.520> see<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> guy<00:01:42.909> like<00:01:43.119> Big<00:01:43.390> Show<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:44.560> that

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
wouldn't see a guy like Big Show do that

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.440 
wouldn't see a guy like Big Show do that
because<00:01:44.950> Big<00:01:45.280> Show<00:01:45.460> doesn't<00:01:45.820> do<00:01:45.939> stuff<00:01:46.240> off

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
because Big Show doesn't do stuff off

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.170 
because Big Show doesn't do stuff off
the<00:01:46.600> top<00:01:46.810> rope<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:48.159> think<00:01:48.729> they<00:01:48.820> tried<00:01:49.030> to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the top rope so I think they tried to

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.800 
the top rope so I think they tried to
make<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.360> as<00:01:49.570> real<00:01:49.869> life<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:51.570> believable<00:01:52.570> as

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
make it as real life and believable as

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.440 
make it as real life and believable as
as<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.380> possibly<00:01:53.860> could<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.369> if<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.119> knew

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
as you possibly could and if you knew

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.830 
as you possibly could and if you knew
that<00:01:55.930> your<00:01:56.920> your<00:01:57.820> favorite<00:01:58.210> wrestler<00:01:58.600> what

that your your favorite wrestler what

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.780 
that your your favorite wrestler what

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
he's capable of doing that would make

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.399 
he's capable of doing that would make
you<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:00.970> all<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.509> all<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.930> better<00:02:02.110> player

you the all that all the better player

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.260
