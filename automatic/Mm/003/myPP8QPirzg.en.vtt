post the link to that in the description
but<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.090> those<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> who<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.810> know<00:00:24.990> what

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
but for those of you who don't know what

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.830 
but for those of you who don't know what
a<00:00:25.320> tee<00:00:25.560> flip-flop<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.449> over<00:00:27.570> here

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
a tee flip-flop is if we look over here

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.839 
a tee flip-flop is if we look over here
at<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.140> lamp<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.160> step<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> pressure

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
at this lamp if you step on the pressure

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.299 
at this lamp if you step on the pressure
plate<00:00:30.000> lamp<00:00:30.599> turns<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.740> when<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.160> then

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
plate lamp turns on or when you and then

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.920 
plate lamp turns on or when you and then
when<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> step<00:00:32.759> off<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.300> lamp<00:00:33.480> turns<00:00:33.719> off

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
when you step off it the lamp turns off

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.069 
when you step off it the lamp turns off
the<00:00:34.680> same<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.010> deal<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.399> button<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:36.079> it

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the same I deal with this button here it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
the same I deal with this button here it
only<00:00:37.230> stays<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.829> while<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> buttons<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.910> know

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
only stays on while the buttons you know

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.720 
only stays on while the buttons you know
on<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.510> while<00:00:39.660> you're<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> pressure<00:00:40.230> plate

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
on or while you're on the pressure plate

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
on or while you're on the pressure plate
so<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> tee<00:00:42.090> flip-flop<00:00:42.629> does<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.500> uses

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so what a tee flip-flop does is it uses

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
so what a tee flip-flop does is it uses
the<00:00:43.860> input<00:00:44.340> from<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> button<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> pressure

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the input from a button or a pressure

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.040 
the input from a button or a pressure
plate<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.410> provide<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> continuous<00:00:47.879> signal<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
plate to provide a continuous signal to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.160 
plate to provide a continuous signal to
any<00:00:49.230> sort<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:49.860> redstone<00:00:50.430> source<00:00:51.170> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
any sort of you know redstone source so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.049 
any sort of you know redstone source so
you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.320> see<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.949> lamps<00:00:53.280> off<00:00:53.460> we'll<00:00:53.940> hit

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
you can see here the lamps off we'll hit

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.020 
you can see here the lamps off we'll hit
the<00:00:54.180> button<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:56.100> lamp<00:00:56.280> will<00:00:56.430> turn<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the button and the lamp will turn on and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.500 
the button and the lamp will turn on and
then<00:00:57.930> once<00:00:58.140> hit<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> button<00:00:58.590> again<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.850> lamp

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
then once hit the button again the lamp

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.310 
then once hit the button again the lamp
will<00:01:00.690> turn<00:01:00.809> back<00:01:00.989> off<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.809> works<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
will turn back off so how that works and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.479 
will turn back off so how that works and
I'll<00:01:04.470> show<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> build<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.250> quick

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I'll show to build one really quick

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.719 
I'll show to build one really quick
you'll<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.689> dig<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.590> block<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
you'll want to dig down one block with

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.870 
you'll want to dig down one block with
the<00:01:08.760> redstone<00:01:09.210> torch<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.280> then<00:01:11.280> three<00:01:11.640> blocks

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the redstone torch and then three blocks

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.280 
the redstone torch and then three blocks
and<00:01:12.330> sort<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> an<00:01:12.990> upside-down<00:01:13.680> l-shape

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
and sort of an upside-down l-shape

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.320 
and sort of an upside-down l-shape
sticky<00:01:16.290> pissed<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> side<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:18.000> sticky

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
sticky pissed on that side and a sticky

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.289 
sticky pissed on that side and a sticky
piston<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.930> side<00:01:19.670> redstone<00:01:20.670> torch<00:01:20.970> there

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
piston on that side redstone torch there

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.240 
piston on that side redstone torch there
redstone<00:01:22.259> torch<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> power<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
redstone torch there to power the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.929 
redstone torch there to power the
Pistons<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.380> redstone<00:01:25.380> connecting<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> top

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.840 

so<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.869> redstone<00:01:31.229> torch<00:01:31.850> put

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so right here on this redstone torch put

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
so right here on this redstone torch put
your<00:01:32.970> output<00:01:33.509> line<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.860> know<00:01:34.979> give

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
your output line this will you know give

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.120 
your output line this will you know give
power<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> whatever<00:01:35.909> you're<00:01:36.030> trying<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:37.130> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
power to whatever you're trying to so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.859 
power to whatever you're trying to so
when<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.280> hit<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> button<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.210> Pistons<00:01:39.479> will

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
when you hit the button the Pistons will

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.950 
when you hit the button the Pistons will
kind<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.170> shift<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:41.250> block<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:42.090> go<00:01:42.840> above

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
kind of shift this block will go above

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080 
kind of shift this block will go above
this<00:01:43.350> redstone<00:01:43.740> torch<00:01:44.189> powering<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> block

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
this redstone torch powering the block

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.740 
this redstone torch powering the block
which<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.049> power<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.649> redstone<00:01:46.979> line

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
which will then power this redstone line

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.859 
which will then power this redstone line
so<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.079> hot<00:01:49.259> tea<00:01:49.470> flip-flop<00:01:49.979> works

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
so it's kind of hot tea flip-flop works

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.710 
so it's kind of hot tea flip-flop works
now<00:01:51.869> most<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:53.490> probably<00:01:53.570> seen<00:01:54.570> this

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
now most of you have probably seen this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.950 
now most of you have probably seen this
door<00:01:54.960> before<00:01:55.290> um<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.100> call<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> ethos<00:01:57.149> door<00:01:57.450> etho

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
door before um I call it ethos door etho

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.630 
door before um I call it ethos door etho
has<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.530> his<00:01:58.649> let's<00:01:58.920> play<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.189> he<00:01:59.430> made

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
has one in his let's play that he made

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.389 
has one in his let's play that he made
and<00:01:59.670> calls<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.210> golden<00:02:00.719> door<00:02:00.930> he<00:02:01.829> uses<00:02:02.100> in

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and calls it the golden door he uses in

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.730 
and calls it the golden door he uses in
his<00:02:02.460> storage<00:02:02.909> room<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.689> his<00:02:04.079> potions

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
his storage room for all of his potions

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.399 
his storage room for all of his potions
and<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.850> spider<00:02:06.180> eyes<00:02:06.420> glass<00:02:07.140> vial

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and you know spider eyes glass vial

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.040 
and you know spider eyes glass vial
stuff<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.890> that

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
stuff like that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.140 
stuff like that
so<00:02:09.770> what<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.070> here<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.460> a<00:02:10.580> pressure<00:02:10.880> plate

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
so what I have here is a pressure plate

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
so what I have here is a pressure plate
with<00:02:11.720> an<00:02:11.870> input<00:02:12.490> connected<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.870> right<00:02:14.870> here

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
with an input connected to right here

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.130 
with an input connected to right here
and<00:02:15.460> then<00:02:16.460> our<00:02:16.550> t<00:02:16.730> flip-flop<00:02:17.240> with<00:02:17.660> our<00:02:17.810> output

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
and then our t flip-flop with our output

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.810 
and then our t flip-flop with our output
on<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.410> side<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.560> you'll<00:02:21.740> step<00:02:22.550> on<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
on this side so you'll step on the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.030 
on this side so you'll step on the
pressure<00:02:23.000> plate<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.960> door<00:02:24.170> will<00:02:24.320> open<00:02:24.410> up<00:02:24.740> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
pressure plate the door will open up you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.800 
pressure plate the door will open up you
can<00:02:25.160> walk<00:02:25.430> through<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:26.210> know<00:02:26.330> pretend<00:02:26.720> this

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
can walk through you know pretend this

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.920 
can walk through you know pretend this
is<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:26.990> room<00:02:27.290> your<00:02:27.710> storage<00:02:28.010> room<00:02:28.340> your<00:02:28.550> bedroom

is a room your storage room your bedroom

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.470 
is a room your storage room your bedroom
your<00:02:29.930> furnace<00:02:30.410> room<00:02:30.620> kind<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.100> whatever<00:02:31.360> go<00:02:32.360> in

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
your furnace room kind of whatever go in

here grab your stuff and then when you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.740 
here grab your stuff and then when you
leave<00:02:34.400> you'll<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.880> step<00:02:35.270> on<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.540> pressure

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
leave you'll just step on the pressure

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.370 
leave you'll just step on the pressure
plate<00:02:35.900> again<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.860> door<00:02:37.040> will<00:02:37.130> close<00:02:38.380> so

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
plate again and the door will close so

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.020 
plate again and the door will close so
quick<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.190> know<00:02:40.220> show<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:40.580> guys<00:02:40.670> how<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.880> have

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
quick you know show you guys how I have

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.470 
quick you know show you guys how I have
this<00:02:41.150> wired<00:02:41.480> up<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.010> have<00:02:43.130> our<00:02:43.160> output<00:02:43.730> once

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
this wired up so we have our output once

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.720 
this wired up so we have our output once
again<00:02:44.630> coming<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.920> redstone<00:02:46.370> torch

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
again coming from the redstone torch

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.310 
again coming from the redstone torch
underneath<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:48.170> dirt<00:02:48.440> block<00:02:49.960> this<00:02:50.960> wraps

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
underneath that dirt block this wraps

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.220 
underneath that dirt block this wraps
around<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:53.210> have<00:02:53.330> three<00:02:53.570> pistons<00:02:53.990> on<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
around so we have three pistons on the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.010 
around so we have three pistons on the
bottom<00:02:54.560> here<00:02:54.800> one<00:02:55.130> on<00:02:55.280> either<00:02:55.400> side<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:56.090> three

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
bottom here one on either side and three

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.480 
bottom here one on either side and three
more<00:02:57.200> up<00:02:57.350> top<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:57.980> see<00:02:58.130> right<00:02:58.160> there

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
more up top as you can see right there

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.780 
more up top as you can see right there
and<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.570> these<00:02:59.720> are<00:02:59.900> set<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.470> just<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.190> one<00:03:01.460> tick

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
and all these are set to just a one tick

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.210 
and all these are set to just a one tick
difference<00:03:02.270> so<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.600> can<00:03:02.720> see<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.960> know<00:03:03.220> no

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
difference so you can see you know no

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.080 
difference so you can see you know no
tick<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:05.720> two<00:03:06.440> three<00:03:07.600> or<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.630> full<00:03:08.960> tick<00:03:10.090> then

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
tick one two three or a full tick then

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.790 
tick one two three or a full tick then
up<00:03:11.270> here<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.660> know<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.840> have<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> full<00:03:12.500> tick

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
up here you know you have a full tick

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800 
up here you know you have a full tick
and<00:03:13.190> then<00:03:13.280> another<00:03:13.459> new<00:03:14.000> repeater<00:03:14.360> with<00:03:14.630> no

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
and then another new repeater with no

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.229 
and then another new repeater with no
tick<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.410> 3<00:03:15.920> +<00:03:16.160> 1<00:03:16.280> 3<00:03:17.060> +<00:03:17.300> 2<00:03:18.850> then<00:03:19.850> here<00:03:20.090> we<00:03:20.120> have

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
tick a 3 + 1 3 + 2 then here we have

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.820 
tick a 3 + 1 3 + 2 then here we have
another<00:03:20.360> repeater<00:03:20.840> because<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.290> signal<00:03:21.530> just

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
another repeater because the signal just

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.340 
another repeater because the signal just
didn't<00:03:22.190> quite<00:03:22.580> reach<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:24.380> this<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.160> actually<00:03:25.430> a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
didn't quite reach so this is actually a

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.830 
didn't quite reach so this is actually a
full<00:03:27.350> tick<00:03:27.620> plus<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.459> 2<00:03:28.700> plus<00:03:29.060> another<00:03:29.480> one

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
full tick plus a 2 plus another one

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.150 
full tick plus a 2 plus another one
which<00:03:30.560> will<00:03:30.709> delay<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.130> by<00:03:31.250> one<00:03:31.700> more<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:34.010> that

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
which will delay it by one more so that

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.070 
which will delay it by one more so that
way<00:03:34.370> when<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:34.730> open<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.150> door<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.630> get<00:03:35.900> this

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
way when you open the door you get this

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.820 
way when you open the door you get this
kind<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.500> cool<00:03:36.940> circle<00:03:37.940> effect<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:42.440> important

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
kind of cool circle effect one important

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.680 
kind of cool circle effect one important
thing<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.010> do<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.670> make<00:03:44.120> sure<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.510> put

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
thing to do is to make sure you put

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.600 
thing to do is to make sure you put
blocks<00:03:44.930> in<00:03:45.230> these<00:03:45.350> corners<00:03:45.830> like<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.430> see

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
blocks in these corners like you can see

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.750 
blocks in these corners like you can see
I<00:03:46.640> have<00:03:46.730> right<00:03:47.120> here<00:03:47.980> because<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.160> door<00:03:49.400> will

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
I have right here because the door will

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.720 
I have right here because the door will
look<00:03:50.000> fine<00:03:50.330> while<00:03:50.720> it's<00:03:50.870> closed<00:03:51.320> but<00:03:51.800> when<00:03:52.580> you

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
look fine while it's closed but when you

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.660 
look fine while it's closed but when you
open<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.180> there<00:03:53.600> will<00:03:53.690> be<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> hole<00:03:54.110> right<00:03:54.140> there

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
open it there will be a hole right there

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.860 
open it there will be a hole right there
so<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:55.820> you<00:03:56.180> know<00:03:56.239> make<00:03:56.420> sure<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.630> throw<00:03:56.780> a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
so just you know make sure you throw a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.930 
so just you know make sure you throw a
block<00:03:57.080> there<00:03:57.489> another<00:03:58.489> thing<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.760> can<00:03:58.820> do

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
block there another thing you can do

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.280 
block there another thing you can do
with<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.209> if<00:03:59.450> one<00:03:59.660> use<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.959> was<00:04:00.080> like<00:04:00.200> an

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
with this if one use I was like an

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.250 
with this if one use I was like an
entrance<00:04:00.739> for<00:04:00.920> your<00:04:00.980> house<00:04:01.330> is<00:04:02.330> do<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.110> little

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
entrance for your house is do a little

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.410 
entrance for your house is do a little
bit<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.470> redstone<00:04:04.070> rewiring<00:04:04.970> here<00:04:07.209> she'll<00:04:08.209> wire

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
bit a redstone rewiring here she'll wire

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.690 
bit a redstone rewiring here she'll wire
it<00:04:08.540> like<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:08.930> you'll<00:04:09.590> have<00:04:09.739> to<00:04:09.950> invert<00:04:10.430> the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
it like that you'll have to invert the

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.920 
it like that you'll have to invert the
signal<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:12.370> keep<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.550> door<00:04:13.730> closed<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.570> then

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
signal to keep the door closed and then

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.789 
signal to keep the door closed and then
let's<00:04:15.170> say<00:04:15.380> you're<00:04:15.590> walking<00:04:16.190> into<00:04:16.280> your<00:04:16.430> house

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
let's say you're walking into your house

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.619 
let's say you're walking into your house
now<00:04:18.280> you're<00:04:18.400> kind<00:04:18.579> of<00:04:18.639> walking<00:04:18.789> in<00:04:19.150> in<00:04:19.449> the

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:19.629 
now you're kind of walking in in the

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:21.449 
now you're kind of walking in in the
doral<00:04:19.930> close<00:04:20.169> right<00:04:20.409> behind<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.949> and<00:04:21.190> then

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
doral close right behind you and then

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.529 
doral close right behind you and then
you<00:04:21.579> left<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.849> wire<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.270> know<00:04:22.360> another

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
you left a wire you know another

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.330 
you left a wire you know another
pressure<00:04:22.870> plate<00:04:23.199> on<00:04:23.349> this<00:04:23.500> side<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.889> reopen

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
pressure plate on this side to reopen

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.809 
pressure plate on this side to reopen
the<00:04:24.430> door<00:04:25.259> but<00:04:26.259> yes<00:04:26.409> so<00:04:26.560> that's<00:04:26.710> kind<00:04:26.949> of<00:04:27.039> ethos

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
the door but yes so that's kind of ethos

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.350 
the door but yes so that's kind of ethos
door<00:04:28.150> both<00:04:28.629> with<00:04:28.960> 80<00:04:29.530> flip-flop<00:04:30.099> or<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:31.270> know

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
door both with 80 flip-flop or you know

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.040 
door both with 80 flip-flop or you know
just<00:04:31.389> by<00:04:31.750> inverting<00:04:32.259> the<00:04:32.530> signal<00:04:34.050> another

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
just by inverting the signal another

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.119 
just by inverting the signal another
thing<00:04:35.319> I've<00:04:35.440> kind<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.650> been<00:04:35.770> messing<00:04:36.099> around

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
thing I've kind of been messing around

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.290 
thing I've kind of been messing around
with<00:04:36.490> is<00:04:36.699> this<00:04:37.330> idea<00:04:37.509> of<00:04:38.909> no<00:04:39.909> just<00:04:39.940> kind<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.240> a

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
with is this idea of no just kind of a

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.050 
with is this idea of no just kind of a
safe<00:04:40.509> house<00:04:41.009> so<00:04:42.009> use<00:04:42.190> your<00:04:42.220> imagination<00:04:42.370> just

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
safe house so use your imagination just

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.240 
safe house so use your imagination just
for<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.300> moment<00:04:43.509> and<00:04:43.840> imagine<00:04:44.319> this<00:04:44.889> kind<00:04:45.159> of

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
for a moment and imagine this kind of

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.360 
for a moment and imagine this kind of
built<00:04:45.550> into<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.210> mountainside<00:04:47.069> you<00:04:48.069> know<00:04:48.190> this

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
built into a mountainside you know this

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.379 
built into a mountainside you know this
is<00:04:48.400> kind<00:04:48.729> of<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.819> cliff<00:04:49.270> let's<00:04:49.629> say<00:04:51.240> so<00:04:52.240> you're

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
is kind of the cliff let's say so you're

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.050 
is kind of the cliff let's say so you're
in<00:04:52.479> your<00:04:52.629> house<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:54.430> when<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:54.580> walk<00:04:54.789> outside

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
in your house and when you walk outside

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.920 
in your house and when you walk outside
the<00:04:56.050> sort<00:04:56.289> of<00:04:56.349> walkway<00:04:56.889> appears<00:04:57.449> you<00:04:58.449> come<00:04:58.810> out

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
the sort of walkway appears you come out

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.309 
the sort of walkway appears you come out
here<00:04:58.960> cut<00:04:59.379> down<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> tree<00:04:59.740> or<00:05:00.250> whatever<00:05:00.550> and

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
here cut down a tree or whatever and

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:06.240 
here cut down a tree or whatever and
then<00:05:02.319> when<00:05:02.440> you<00:05:02.560> walk<00:05:02.830> back<00:05:03.069> inside<00:05:05.250> the

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
then when you walk back inside the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.610 
then when you walk back inside the
walkway<00:05:06.639> disappears<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:07.509> mobs<00:05:07.810> can't<00:05:08.500> you

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
walkway disappears so mobs can't you

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.640 
walkway disappears so mobs can't you
know<00:05:08.680> get<00:05:08.860> into<00:05:09.009> your<00:05:09.099> house<00:05:10.229> same<00:05:11.229> idea<00:05:11.379> with

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
know get into your house same idea with

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.129 
know get into your house same idea with
this<00:05:11.800> everyone<00:05:12.280> we<00:05:12.699> have<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.360> pressure<00:05:13.840> plate

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
this everyone we have the pressure plate

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.649 
this everyone we have the pressure plate
which<00:05:14.680> is<00:05:14.710> right<00:05:15.340> under<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.580> iron<00:05:16.270> ore<00:05:16.509> right

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
which is right under that iron ore right

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.439 
which is right under that iron ore right
on<00:05:16.810> top<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.409> should<00:05:17.560> say<00:05:17.680> that<00:05:17.860> iron<00:05:18.099> block

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
on top of I should say that iron block

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.180 
on top of I should say that iron block
used<00:05:19.449> as<00:05:19.659> our<00:05:19.780> input<00:05:19.990> for<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.159> t<00:05:21.370> flip-flop<00:05:21.940> as

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
used as our input for the t flip-flop as

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.930 
used as our input for the t flip-flop as
well<00:05:24.190> as<00:05:24.520> our<00:05:24.699> input<00:05:24.909> for<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.870> piston<00:05:26.710> door

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
well as our input for the piston door

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.219 
well as our input for the piston door
now<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.000> can<00:05:28.240> use<00:05:28.449> just<00:05:28.630> a<00:05:28.719> normally<00:05:29.110> no

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
now you can use just a normally no

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.260 
now you can use just a normally no
wooden<00:05:29.560> or<00:05:29.650> iron<00:05:29.860> door<00:05:30.130> but<00:05:30.639> I<00:05:30.669> really<00:05:31.060> like

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
wooden or iron door but I really like

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.749 
wooden or iron door but I really like
the<00:05:31.449> look<00:05:31.599> of<00:05:31.840> both<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.710> those<00:05:33.009> blocks<00:05:33.340> being

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
the look of both of those blocks being

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.200 
the look of both of those blocks being
pulled<00:05:34.000> all<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.300> way<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:36.340> our<00:05:36.460> T<00:05:36.669> flip-flop

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
pulled all the way so our T flip-flop

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.769 
pulled all the way so our T flip-flop
output<00:05:37.380> starts<00:05:38.380> there<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.949> wraps<00:05:39.909> around<00:05:40.180> up

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
output starts there and wraps around up

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.779 
output starts there and wraps around up
here<00:05:40.810> and<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:41.620> connected<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.130> these<00:05:42.250> pistons

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
here and is connected to these pistons

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.939 
here and is connected to these pistons
and<00:05:44.639> then<00:05:45.639> this<00:05:46.029> other<00:05:46.620> pressure<00:05:47.620> plate<00:05:47.860> you

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
and then this other pressure plate you

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.779 
and then this other pressure plate you
can<00:05:48.069> see<00:05:48.219> there<00:05:49.650> is<00:05:50.650> on<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:50.889> separate<00:05:51.310> you<00:05:51.639> know

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
can see there is on a separate you know

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.610 
can see there is on a separate you know
line<00:05:52.330> of<00:05:52.509> redstone<00:05:52.840> so<00:05:53.139> it<00:05:53.199> doesn't<00:05:53.469> conflict

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
line of redstone so it doesn't conflict

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.360 
line of redstone so it doesn't conflict
with<00:05:54.099> our<00:05:54.610> T<00:05:54.879> flip-flop<00:05:55.449> and<00:05:56.069> that<00:05:57.069> wraps

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
with our T flip-flop and that wraps

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.360 
with our T flip-flop and that wraps
around<00:05:57.669> and<00:05:58.449> connects<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.289> our<00:05:59.319> double<00:06:00.159> piston

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
around and connects to our double piston

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.450 
around and connects to our double piston
door<00:06:00.699> as<00:06:00.879> well<00:06:01.770> so<00:06:02.770> then<00:06:02.919> it's<00:06:03.009> kind<00:06:03.129> of<00:06:03.159> a<00:06:03.250> fun

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
door as well so then it's kind of a fun

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.749 
door as well so then it's kind of a fun
idea<00:06:03.610> for<00:06:03.849> you<00:06:04.629> know<00:06:05.099> kind<00:06:06.099> of<00:06:06.129> a<00:06:06.219> safe<00:06:06.490> house

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
idea for you know kind of a safe house

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.110 
idea for you know kind of a safe house
idea<00:06:08.099> another<00:06:09.099> option<00:06:09.490> you<00:06:09.580> could<00:06:09.729> do<00:06:09.940> with

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
idea another option you could do with

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.200 
idea another option you could do with
this<00:06:10.300> is<00:06:10.830> you<00:06:11.830> know<00:06:11.949> set<00:06:12.279> this<00:06:12.460> instead<00:06:13.000> of<00:06:13.060> on

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
this is you know set this instead of on

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.149 
this is you know set this instead of on
a<00:06:13.240> tee<00:06:13.509> flip-flop<00:06:14.050> set<00:06:14.440> on<00:06:14.590> some<00:06:14.770> sort<00:06:14.979> of<00:06:15.069> a

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
a tee flip-flop set on some sort of a

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.089 
a tee flip-flop set on some sort of a
timer<00:06:15.490> so<00:06:15.879> that<00:06:16.810> way<00:06:17.050> when<00:06:17.349> you<00:06:17.469> walk<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:17.949> you

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
timer so that way when you walk and you

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:19.830 
timer so that way when you walk and you
know<00:06:18.219> set<00:06:18.460> it<00:06:18.580> so<00:06:18.669> when<00:06:18.789> you<00:06:18.879> walk<00:06:19.060> off<00:06:19.330> it<00:06:19.569> the

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
know set it so when you walk off it the

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.490 
know set it so when you walk off it the
Fingal<00:06:20.229> retract<00:06:20.919> again<00:06:21.569> so<00:06:22.569> that<00:06:22.599> way<00:06:22.960> mobs

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
Fingal retract again so that way mobs

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.320 
Fingal retract again so that way mobs
can<00:06:23.800> get<00:06:24.099> home<00:06:24.310> even<00:06:24.879> when<00:06:24.909> you're<00:06:25.120> not<00:06:25.150> there

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
can get home even when you're not there

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.959 
can get home even when you're not there
so<00:06:26.110> it's<00:06:26.259> a<00:06:26.289> little<00:06:26.380> bit<00:06:26.500> of<00:06:26.770> a<00:06:27.250> safer<00:06:27.639> safe

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
so it's a little bit of a safer safe

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.270 
so it's a little bit of a safer safe
house<00:06:28.180> if<00:06:28.479> you<00:06:28.599> want<00:06:28.750> to<00:06:28.810> call<00:06:28.930> it<00:06:28.990> that

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
house if you want to call it that

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.370 
house if you want to call it that
well<00:06:30.790> that's<00:06:30.970> it<00:06:31.120> for<00:06:31.300> today<00:06:31.600> everybody<00:06:32.139> um

learned<00:06:34.960> a<00:06:35.260> little<00:06:35.440> bit<00:06:35.590> about<00:06:35.950> t<00:06:36.250> flip-flops

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
learned a little bit about t flip-flops

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.270 
learned a little bit about t flip-flops
I<00:06:37.300> really<00:06:38.050> like<00:06:38.260> that<00:06:38.440> I<00:06:38.500> think<00:06:38.590> it's<00:06:38.980> a<00:06:39.130> lot

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
I really like that I think it's a lot

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.090 
I really like that I think it's a lot
cooler<00:06:39.580> than<00:06:39.820> using<00:06:40.780> a<00:06:40.990> lever<00:06:41.260> especially<00:06:42.010> if

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
cooler than using a lever especially if

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.740 
cooler than using a lever especially if
you're<00:06:42.250> opening<00:06:42.639> a<00:06:42.730> door<00:06:42.970> like<00:06:43.180> that<00:06:43.389> you<00:06:43.720> know

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
you're opening a door like that you know

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.500 
you're opening a door like that you know
you<00:06:44.020> can<00:06:44.139> walk<00:06:44.320> over<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.650> pressure<00:06:44.889> plate<00:06:45.160> and

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
you can walk over the pressure plate and

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.420 
you can walk over the pressure plate and
just<00:06:46.510> looks<00:06:46.780> up<00:06:46.990> more<00:06:47.620> fancy<00:06:48.070> little<00:06:48.160> bit<00:06:48.310> more

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
just looks up more fancy little bit more

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.850
