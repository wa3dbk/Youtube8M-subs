Iowa's new update character review of
Teen<00:00:17.039> Titans<00:00:17.610> cyborg<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> he<00:00:20.520> isn't<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.849> best

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
Teen Titans cyborg so he isn't the best

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.999 
Teen Titans cyborg so he isn't the best
card<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.259> his<00:00:22.680> health<00:00:23.489> is<00:00:23.789> pretty<00:00:24.630> good<00:00:25.009> his

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009

attack<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.759> 700<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:27.989> that<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.919> could

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
attack is at 700 I think that that could

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.950 
attack is at 700 I think that that could
possibly<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.879> lowest<00:00:31.099> attack<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.510> all<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
possibly be the lowest attack of all of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.610 
possibly be the lowest attack of all of
the<00:00:34.700> golds<00:00:35.700> no<00:00:36.500> prison<00:00:37.500> Superman<00:00:37.920> has<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:39.620> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the golds no prison Superman has that so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.330 
the golds no prison Superman has that so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
percent and then silver is 150 but this

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
percent and then silver is 150 but this
is<00:01:03.329> double<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.409> silver<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.129> just

were to find them in the shop this is
how<00:01:46.409> much<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.709> would<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.009> three<00:01:47.340> hundred

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.470 
disrupted I'm gonna try and get it up to
the<00:03:58.600> top<00:03:58.810> here<00:03:59.670> against<00:04:00.670> arrow<00:04:00.940> green<00:04:01.269> arrow

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
the top here against arrow green arrow

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.479 
the top here against arrow green arrow
my<00:04:02.049> arrow<00:04:02.290> green<00:04:02.590> arrow<00:04:02.769> actually<00:04:03.280> just

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
my arrow green arrow actually just

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.180 
my arrow green arrow actually just
silver<00:04:04.000> green<00:04:04.209> arrow<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.630> think<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.829> could

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
silver green arrow I think that could

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.400 
silver green arrow I think that could
possibly<00:04:06.670> be<00:04:06.790> I'm<00:04:07.600> not<00:04:07.840> sure<00:04:08.049> what<00:04:08.200> green

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
possibly be I'm not sure what green

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.740 
possibly be I'm not sure what green
arrow<00:04:08.590> there's<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:09.010> think<00:04:09.180> uncertain<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.540> no

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
arrow there's I think uncertain is it no

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.449 
arrow there's I think uncertain is it no
just<00:04:10.989> normal<00:04:11.170> I'm<00:04:11.560> not<00:04:11.769> I'm<00:04:11.980> really<00:04:12.190> not<00:04:12.370> sure

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
just normal I'm not I'm really not sure

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.670 
just normal I'm not I'm really not sure
so<00:04:13.209> it's<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.420> second<00:04:13.780> move<00:04:13.930> touchdown<00:04:14.410> straight

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
so it's a second move touchdown straight

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.699 
so it's a second move touchdown straight
away<00:04:14.890> rapid<00:04:15.670> swipe<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.510> then<00:04:16.539> we've<00:04:17.470> done

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
away rapid swipe and then we've done

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.099 
away rapid swipe and then we've done
that<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.070> rapid<00:04:18.549> swap<00:04:18.760> akin<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.780> hopefully

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
that and rapid swap akin to hopefully

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.790 
that and rapid swap akin to hopefully
defeat<00:04:20.579> this<00:04:21.579> guy<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.360> now<00:04:23.320> we're<00:04:23.500> up<00:04:23.560> against

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
defeat this guy and now we're up against

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.600 
defeat this guy and now we're up against
containment<00:04:24.490> suit<00:04:24.640> doomsday<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:26.530> what's<00:04:27.430> this

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
containment suit doomsday so what's this

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.969 
containment suit doomsday so what's this
guy's<00:04:27.850> passive<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.330> can't<00:04:28.539> remember<00:04:28.810> oh<00:04:29.200> yeah

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
guy's passive I can't remember oh yeah

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.309 
guy's passive I can't remember oh yeah
hey<00:04:30.760> when<00:04:31.270> he<00:04:31.360> gets<00:04:31.539> down<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:32.190> below<00:04:33.190> 50%

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
hey when he gets down to below 50%

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.499 
hey when he gets down to below 50%
think<00:04:34.710> no<00:04:35.129> when<00:04:35.309> he's<00:04:35.430> about<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.849> die<00:04:36.089> I<00:04:36.119> think

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
think no when he's about to die I think

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.820 
think no when he's about to die I think
he<00:04:36.659> gets<00:04:37.559> up<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.759> 50%<00:04:39.119> of<00:04:39.419> his<00:04:39.539> health<00:04:39.779> again<00:04:40.259> so

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
he gets up to 50% of his health again so

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.909 
he gets up to 50% of his health again so
here's<00:04:41.099> his<00:04:41.279> super<00:04:41.819> move<00:04:42.289> my<00:04:43.289> camera<00:04:43.529> what<00:04:43.830> the

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
here's his super move my camera what the

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:53.920 
here's his super move my camera what the
name<00:04:44.069> is

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.689 

so<00:04:54.500> that's<00:04:54.650> pretty<00:04:54.830> cool<00:04:55.009> super<00:04:55.280> move<00:04:55.460> and

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
so that's pretty cool super move and

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.680 
so that's pretty cool super move and
here<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.120> his<00:04:56.889> passive<00:04:57.889> an<00:04:58.040> action

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
cyborgs card and my set up there he will

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.710 
cyborgs card and my set up there he will
be<00:05:28.960> regenerating<00:05:29.960> or<00:05:30.530> generating<00:05:31.370> his<00:05:32.090> energy

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
be regenerating or generating his energy

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.370 
be regenerating or generating his energy
at<00:05:33.460> 300<00:05:34.460> percent<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:35.090> normal<00:05:35.539> rate<00:05:35.930> this<00:05:36.199> is

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
at 300 percent the normal rate this is

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.189 
at 300 percent the normal rate this is
his<00:05:36.530> passive<00:05:37.150> as<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.389> can<00:05:38.539> see<00:05:38.780> he's<00:05:38.960> already

move so if you don't know what through

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.600 
move so if you don't know what through
300%<00:05:52.759> is<00:05:53.530> which<00:05:54.530> I<00:05:54.800> don't<00:05:54.919> know<00:05:55.130> who<00:05:55.340> wouldn't

know that that's just three times the
normal<00:05:58.250> person's<00:05:58.970> energy<00:05:59.780> region<00:06:00.320> while

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
normal person's energy region while

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.589 
normal person's energy region while
they're<00:06:00.710> tagged<00:06:01.010> out<00:06:01.280> so<00:06:02.060> he's<00:06:02.180> already<00:06:02.360> got<00:06:02.570> a

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
they're tagged out so he's already got a

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.029 
they're tagged out so he's already got a
super<00:06:02.870> move<00:06:03.050> and<00:06:03.229> I'm<00:06:03.289> gonna<00:06:03.410> come<00:06:03.620> on<00:06:03.770> to<00:06:03.919> them
