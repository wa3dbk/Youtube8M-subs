00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 hello everyone and here we are finally with the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.779
 Highly sought after grisbì recipe 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.779
 obviously home made 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.040
 then he started making the pastry at 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.030
 cocoa is intel being cocoa flour 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.030
 in a bowl 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.820
 then add the softened butter a 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.300
 room temperature by breaking it up 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.300
 all 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.479
 and now I'm going to knead with my hands 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.149
 trying to get the whole butter to absorb 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:31.659
 the flour and at the end will have to get 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:35.319
 like so many crumbs at this point 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.970
 I add sugar and eggs and then it goes 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.830
 in front of kneading until you do 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.280
 the classic cake will be formed 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.280
 shortcrust pastry 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.859
 at this point that the cake is 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.269
 formed I cover it with the film and the 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.189
 leave to rest at room temperature 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.189
 for about 20 30 minutes 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.040
 ok at this point by putting a piece of 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.189
 baking paper on the table so I won't have to 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.019
 use flour and peeling off a piece 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.540
 of pastry start spread it with the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.340
 rolling pin making a not too thick layer 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.409
 thin but not too often we say 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.709
 half way a half centimeter of 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.709
 unless 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.569
 now helping me with a pastry cutter or if 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.330
 you don't even use it 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.489
 coffee cups started making all the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.230
 circles that will be the base and the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.230
 then coverage of the gris dic 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.510
 ok once formed deformed I go to them 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.669
 to put this in a pan too 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.710
 coated with parchment paper and with this one 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.250
 chocolate cream that is nothing but 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.389
 chocolate custard in fact 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.389
 I'm going to stuff cookies 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.399
 and then I remember them with another disk 

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:19.089
 trying to seal everyone well 

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.089
 all edges 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.860
 after doing this I put 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.020
 this pan in the fridge for at least 15 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.210
 minutes so they can cool down 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.919
 well then put them in the oven 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.330
 preheated to 180 degrees for 10 minutes 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.080
 no more because otherwise they will break 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.300
 and they will become hard and here are ours 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.189
 homemade grisbì I swear I am 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.139
 too good maybe even better than 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.909
 those indeed certainly even better than 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.319
 those that are bought 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:11.150
 I hope this recipe is there too 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.150
 liked see you at the next hello
