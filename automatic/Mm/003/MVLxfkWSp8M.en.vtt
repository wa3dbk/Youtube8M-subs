00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.740
 certainly today to those who plasma in 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.540
 game the thing goes for images and 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.940
 trailers and is that it has also 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.910
 presented the new splinter trailer 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.820
 cell black list that next adventure of 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.160
 our dearest sunfish in that spy 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.020
 that shows again this time in a 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.150
 trailer that focuses on the plot 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.860
 this new black list splinter 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.439
 remember that recently also 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.649
 we said that the most recommended version 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.920
 on the part of the ubisoft guys this 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.690
 title was the version of wii ojito with 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.000
 this says that the playable experience goes 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.980
 to be very good very thought for the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.449
 wii command and especially that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.109
 graphically we are going to surprise 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:51.379
 quite and finally we could be before 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.969
 a multiplatform title totally to 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.649
 the height of the new console 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.199
 nintendo so we 'll see if it really 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.149
 this is true and it has been thought more about 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.010
 this console at the time of programming 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.559
 but good for the moment we are left with 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.840
 this trailer a trailer that proposes us 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.340
 they say its creators become 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.340
 in what he fears most 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.619
 but my way 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.030
 i 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 yes
