00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:29.809 
here not many people though can see some

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.740 
here not many people though can see some
people<00:00:30.550> it's<00:00:31.550> also<00:00:31.759> not<00:00:32.000> live<00:00:32.269> garlic<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.379> I

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
people it's also not live garlic so I

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.520 
people it's also not live garlic so I
guess

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.170 

might<00:00:39.530> not<00:00:39.650> be<00:00:39.710> safe<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.190> swim<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:40.790> really<00:00:41.030> like

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
might not be safe to swim I really like

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.790 
might not be safe to swim I really like
these<00:00:41.500> ropes<00:00:42.500> there<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.520> I<00:00:44.480> think<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.620> water

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
these ropes there and I think the water

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.410 
these ropes there and I think the water
goes<00:00:46.070> actually<00:00:46.310> between<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.790> rocks<00:00:47.060> looks

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420

check it out on the internet and read
about<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.659> more<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.950> looks<00:02:06.159> quite

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
about it more so it looks quite

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.570 
about it more so it looks quite
interesting<00:02:06.399> this<00:02:06.970> part<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.930> little<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:09.429> the
