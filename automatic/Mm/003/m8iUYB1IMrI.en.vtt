00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
under the tree before this little elf

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.180 
under the tree before this little elf
comes<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.900> regardless<00:02:13.590> that's<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> first

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
comes but regardless that's the first

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.300 
comes but regardless that's the first
app<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:15.480> second<00:02:15.900> app<00:02:16.020> fmx<00:02:16.560> writers<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
app the second app fmx writers is a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.160 
app the second app fmx writers is a
pretty<00:02:17.760> cool<00:02:18.030> 3d<00:02:20.510> or<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.690> at<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> next

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pretty cool 3d or not at the next

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.860 
pretty cool 3d or not at the next
motocross<00:02:22.590> game

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
motocross game

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.140 

so<00:02:25.870> once<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.440> app<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.920> app<00:02:27.100> actually<00:02:27.520> this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
so once the app this app actually this

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.760 
so once the app this app actually this
app<00:02:28.330> does<00:02:28.360> take<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.780> while<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.170> load<00:02:29.320> it's<00:02:29.590> all

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
app does take a while to load it's all

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.490 
app does take a while to load it's all
3d<00:02:30.420> graphics<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.600> stuff<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.410> of

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
3d graphics and stuff so this is one of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.220 
3d graphics and stuff so this is one of
the<00:02:32.590> longest<00:02:32.890> loading<00:02:33.490> apps<00:02:33.670> I've<00:02:33.910> ever<00:02:34.230> seen

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
the longest loading apps I've ever seen

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.130 
the longest loading apps I've ever seen
but<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> cool<00:02:36.280> app<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.510> I'll<00:02:37.630> get<00:02:37.870> into<00:02:38.110> a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
but it is a cool app so I'll get into a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.010 
but it is a cool app so I'll get into a
single<00:02:38.530> player<00:02:38.830> game<00:02:38.860> really<00:02:39.340> quick<00:02:39.780> let's<00:02:40.780> go

we can go race freestyle three laps and
hot<00:02:49.270> lap<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.960> go<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.110> race<00:02:50.680> let's<00:02:51.580> do

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
hot lap I'm going to go to race let's do

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.880 
hot lap I'm going to go to race let's do
250<00:02:52.600> cc<00:02:53.220> touch<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.430> start<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.990> simply<00:02:59.230> go

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
250 cc touch the start so you simply go

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.830 
250 cc touch the start so you simply go
you<00:03:00.400> move<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.730> accelerometer<00:03:01.390> once<00:03:01.690> you've

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
you move the accelerometer once you've

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.600 
you move the accelerometer once you've
hit<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.020> ramp<00:03:02.350> here<00:03:02.710> you<00:03:02.890> can<00:03:03.070> actually<00:03:03.220> perform

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
hit a ramp here you can actually perform

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.840 
hit a ramp here you can actually perform
tricks<00:03:04.290> by<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.710> looks<00:03:06.160> like<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.400> didn't<00:03:06.640> jump

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
tricks by and looks like I didn't jump

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.320 
tricks by and looks like I didn't jump
that<00:03:07.030> high<00:03:07.240> but<00:03:07.510> let<00:03:07.750> me<00:03:07.780> try<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.050> get<00:03:08.230> one<00:03:08.350> here

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
that high but let me try to get one here

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.810 
that high but let me try to get one here
so<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.390> can<00:03:10.510> actually<00:03:10.660> perform<00:03:11.170> trip<00:03:11.820> didn't

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
so you can actually perform trip didn't

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.580 
so you can actually perform trip didn't
want<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.030> hit<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.240> log<00:03:13.480> there<00:03:13.510> but<00:03:14.260> pretty

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
want to hit that log there but pretty

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.740 
want to hit that log there but pretty
cool<00:03:14.890> game<00:03:15.130> fun<00:03:15.490> game<00:03:15.730> great<00:03:16.210> graphics<00:03:17.430> and

yeah so that's the second app that we
have<00:03:21.130> for<00:03:21.340> today<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:22.030> third<00:03:22.270> app<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.570> we

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
have for today the third app that we

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.630 
have for today the third app that we
have<00:03:22.780> today<00:03:22.900> assault<00:03:23.710> squadron<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.610> a

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.370 
side-scrolling shooter game you go ahead
and<00:03:27.730> resume<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.720> basically<00:03:31.720> just<00:03:32.230> like

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
and resume this and basically just like

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.070 
and resume this and basically just like
other<00:03:32.560> side<00:03:32.860> scrolling<00:03:33.220> shooters<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.600> simply

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
other side scrolling shooters you simply

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.230 
other side scrolling shooters you simply
have<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.260> blast<00:03:35.680> up<00:03:36.040> all<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:36.700> can<00:03:36.910> on<00:03:37.150> the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
have to blast up all that you can on the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.660 
have to blast up all that you can on the
screen<00:03:37.570> collect<00:03:38.380> little<00:03:38.590> power-ups<00:03:39.190> there's

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
screen collect little power-ups there's

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.310 
screen collect little power-ups there's
different<00:03:40.060> control<00:03:40.480> modes<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.960> we<00:03:41.050> have

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
different control modes that we have

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.990 
different control modes that we have
right<00:03:41.530> now<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.770> have<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.070> one<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.580> one<00:03:42.610> ratio

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
right now I have it one to one ratio

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.390 
right now I have it one to one ratio
where<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:44.050> plane<00:03:44.320> is<00:03:44.350> literally<00:03:44.980> under<00:03:45.010> my

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
where the plane is literally under my

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.010 
where the plane is literally under my
thumb<00:03:45.640> there's<00:03:45.940> different<00:03:46.300> ratios<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.720> you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
thumb there's different ratios that you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.250 
thumb there's different ratios that you
can<00:03:47.170> set<00:03:47.410> there's<00:03:47.620> also<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:47.980> tilt<00:03:48.460> to<00:03:48.610> control

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
can set there's also a tilt to control

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.510 
can set there's also a tilt to control
scroller<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.650> don't<00:03:50.770> like<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.220> plane

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
scroller so if you don't like the plane

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.070 
scroller so if you don't like the plane
mean<00:03:51.760> right<00:03:52.060> under<00:03:52.330> your<00:03:52.450> finger<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.930> can

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
mean right under your finger you can

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.050 
mean right under your finger you can
change<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.500> up<00:03:53.560> in<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.860> options<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.880> that's
