00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
one because there because it is

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.490 
one because there because it is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
there's some things i completely go the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.980 
there's some things i completely go the
opposite<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.820> there's<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.570> few<00:02:48.720> things<00:02:48.810> i'm

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
opposite to and there's a few things i'm

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.170 
opposite to and there's a few things i'm
completely<00:02:49.350> polarized<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:49.980> right<00:02:50.760> there<00:02:51.030> on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
completely polarized on right there on

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.450 
completely polarized on right there on
some<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.780> their<00:02:52.130> ideologies<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.220> things<00:02:53.370> like

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
some of their ideologies and things like

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.050 
some of their ideologies and things like
that<00:02:53.520> but<00:02:54.210> fundamentally<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:56.370> think

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
that but fundamentally and I think

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.820 
that but fundamentally and I think
they're<00:02:57.180> doing<00:02:57.360> great<00:02:57.480> work<00:02:57.840> fundamentally<00:02:58.620> I

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
they're doing great work fundamentally I

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.820 
they're doing great work fundamentally I
do<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.420> I<00:03:00.420> will<00:03:00.600> continue<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:01.080> support<00:03:01.620> them

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
do and I will continue to support them

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.700 
do and I will continue to support them
as<00:03:02.070> long<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:02.820> continue<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.710> it's

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
as long as they continue to do that it's

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.740 
as long as they continue to do that it's
as<00:03:04.860> simple<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:06.150> as<00:03:06.330> simple<00:03:06.480> as<00:03:06.690> that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
as simple as that it's as simple as that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.290 
as simple as that it's as simple as that
so<00:03:07.230> if<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.340> get<00:03:08.520> anything<00:03:08.670> York<00:03:08.880> watching<00:03:09.210> this
