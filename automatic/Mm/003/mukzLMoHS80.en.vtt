00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.370
 Hello, well, here we are again 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.860
 with another video of a citizen 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.520
 in this case it is one of those that have 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.270
 left now in May of the last 2014 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.330
 baking 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.330
 it is a controlled radio of the drive 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.110
 high-end then in functions you will not be 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.110
 you can ask for more 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.559
 it's about the model here we see it the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.559
 art 90 30 04 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.210
 we do not know how it is black belt with 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.510
 black holes also has the edge 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.700
 of the orange is curious because only the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.760
 edge is orange and then the stitching 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.850
 red that is the little detail has the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.420
 color thus seen from front 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.640
 on the strap so we see then the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.770
 details in the same color more or less 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.130
 orange red in hope 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.370
 what can we say then of clocks of 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.370
 steel 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.320
 controlled radio so you do not have to 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.310
 put it on time you can never say that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.189
 you only need to put battery ever 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:36.270
 it's submersible puts us here that is 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.270
 submersible specifically puts it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.189
 by god I do not see it 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.430
 yes 200 meters 20 gal 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.580
 200 meters 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.320
 and well then, we can comment 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.690
 what we have 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 the work with the normal needles and the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.560
 normal seconds as all watches 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.960
 the calendar of the calendar see that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.280
 perpetual calendar with which always 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.320
 for the 28 February, the 29 30 of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.050
 all months 30 and 31 because there is no need 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.970
 adjust adjusts the only because they leave 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.190
 every moment what what you have to 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.810
 put then we have in the sphere of 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.180
 above is indicating us right now the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.430
 day of the week but we have in this 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.490
 case new double-double wednesday in 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 English in this area marks us air or 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.840
 pm specify we will do at five o'clock 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.660
 ten in the afternoon 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.940
 and then in the small sphere work that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.680
 we also mark the time or the alarm 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.960
 depending on the function that we are 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.030
 using 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.030
 The watch also has a function of 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.170
 put to the commented of the valley 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.960
 controlled and tells us the battery 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 remaining that remains for the brand in the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.940
 sphere above in this bar here 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.520
 up who told us there is a hairline 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.980
 degraded and in red then yes we 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.920
 indicates whether the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.010
 backup battery that has charged 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.150
 It seems to me that eight months is what 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.540
 I could be in complete darkness 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.310
 for eight months running 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.950
 functions so we can live like this 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.780
 quickly then if we press the button 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.409
 below indicates the cargo reservation 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 and stops here telling us if he has 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.110
 received or has not received the signal of 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.440
 radio against him 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.440
 that would be the first quick function of the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.300
 real 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.630
 and on the button above what we do 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.290
 is 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.290
 function 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.770
 the call to 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.870
 at the time of the clock 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.780
 just try to receive it 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.920
 if we are in an area with coverage 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.920
 I would receive the time 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.260
 and more things that they commented 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.120
 has chronograph we also have the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.250
 monkey that has pain the alarm and then 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.780
 has also we can see in the little circle 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.950
 around you can mark us 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.430
 quick the time in any of the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.740
 precision 28 30 cities of the world do not 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.530
 we know here because 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:24.130
 from the bank beijing tokyo 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:28.550
 oakland santiago de chile- azores paris 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.130
 london in short this kind of story 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.770
 and well, I think there is more 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.410
 least seen without commenting the closing the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.550
 closure is a closure also of the sedena 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:49.600
 It is the typical buckle closure option 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:49.600
 now we raise this lever of good 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.330
 we put the strap 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.240
 we close it in the hole that we have left 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:08.690
 in this case 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:10.960
 and it's on this side after this one for 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.960
 open it 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:21.250
 It is comfortable to put and remains very discreet 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:25.730
 the closure can not be noticed 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:29.620
 too much and good, I think it's 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:33.050
 more or less seen on the clock how is 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.430
 what you see in the video is the appearance 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.310
 physical not because then the 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.590
 characteristics because I do not know about it either 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.650
 memory now to mess with him with the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.540
 video and in any case by email 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.110
 or by phone you I can explain what 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.570
 whatever is needed 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.760
 and well, I do not know, I think that nothing else 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.480
 greetings thank you for watching the video and up 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.480
 the next
