00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
gotta be mobile site using the infrared
port<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:33.510> ahead<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.050> scroll<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.890> by

port I can go ahead and scroll just by

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.459 
port I can go ahead and scroll just by
waving<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.550> hand<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> infrared<00:00:40.230> sensor

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
waving my hand over the infrared sensor

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
waving my hand over the infrared sensor
and<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.190> scroll<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.180> wave<00:00:42.360> my

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and it will scroll up and if I wave my

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.040 
and it will scroll up and if I wave my
hand<00:00:42.750> down<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.739> will<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> scroll<00:00:44.610> down

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
hand down it will know to scroll down

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
hand down it will know to scroll down
another<00:00:46.050> feature<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.100> actually<00:00:47.610> use

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
another feature would be to actually use

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020 
another feature would be to actually use
the<00:00:48.660> eye<00:00:48.690> control<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.219> once<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> eye

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the eye control so here once the eye

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.049 
the eye control so here once the eye
control<00:00:51.629> turns<00:00:51.899> green<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.980> did<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.550> can

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
control turns green as it just did I can

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.660 
control turns green as it just did I can
go<00:00:54.180> ahead<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.719> move<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.140> eyes<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
go ahead and move my eyes or actually to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
go ahead and move my eyes or actually to
just<00:00:56.940> tilt<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> phone<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.620> would

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
just tilt the phone and it would

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
just tilt the phone and it would
actually<00:00:59.039> scroll<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> direction<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
actually scroll in the direction that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:12.090 
actually scroll in the direction that
I'm<00:01:01.230> tilting

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.670 

so<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.120> eye<00:01:13.150> sensor<00:01:13.810> actually<00:01:14.170> uses<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
so the eye sensor actually uses the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.740 
so the eye sensor actually uses the
front-facing<00:01:15.040> camera<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.000> detect<00:01:16.120> your<00:01:16.540> eyes

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
front-facing camera to detect your eyes

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.830 
front-facing camera to detect your eyes
and<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.440> direction<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:18.040> your<00:01:18.190> eyes<00:01:18.840> relative

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
and the direction of your eyes relative

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.469 
and the direction of your eyes relative
to<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.140> display<00:01:20.590> or<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.310> camera<00:01:21.850> to

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
to the display or to the camera to

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.780 
to the display or to the camera to
enable<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.200> phone<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.590> scroll<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.430> these<00:01:24.610> are

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
enable the phone to scroll so these are

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.510 
enable the phone to scroll so these are
two<00:01:25.090> ways<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.360> scroll<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.110> phone<00:01:26.520> another

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
two ways to scroll the phone another

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.880 
two ways to scroll the phone another
