00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.420
 video is found on the game call of 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.020
 kids so this is not a video 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.300
 that has 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.120
 nor the big scores etc that's all 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.559
 just a discovery part on the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.680
 new game mode that has appeared the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.020
 Friday, May 30, 2014 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.180
 this Friday moment when I speak to you 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.250
 I hope I 'll upload before 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.020
 the end of the week on the chains 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.600
 community and yes because I'm going 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.340
 trying to send this video has caused f 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440
 or a code that I have so both young 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.570
 Francophone community most 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.670
 known and those who have more subscribers the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.020
 most active community see in 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.280
 hoping that I like it would make me 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.080
 really great fun 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.120
 so guys this mode happened on the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.159
 Friday, May 30 at the same time as the 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.420
 double xp of which you already have it I stop 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.909
 a little in my comment is watched 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.320
 over 1500 I take a break from 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.540
 domination is the first time that that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.640
 happened to me more than 1500 it was my all 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.979
 first part I do not know what he 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.060
 had to do and it's after that 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.520
 guys I kind of figured out what he 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.610
 had to do so in fact you have 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.350
 three flags so at b and c the three 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.700
 flags are laid all over 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.189
 the map is really not the breaks 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.560
 usual extra how dominating is in 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.950
 do as one does that you have to 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.590
 wait for the end of game or so if you 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.689
 go for example take a break from 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.609
 15 hours to pau and ben that you do 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.670
 to appear the team frankly that me 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:12.120
 super mode for xp you xp mandy this 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.170
 it's a big thing 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.450
 frankly in this game was playing in at 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.830
 what you 've seen I'm going 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.320
 unlock it helicopter pilot bull and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.240
 nico and me moroccan trinity and 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.230
 frankly at first I thought you 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.280
 will have six innings because I have 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.280
 really used to doing clan is going 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.350
 and this clan as 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.400
 I am a decerto player at the base of 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.260
 virus is in six runs 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.410
 but actually it was when the frame I 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.630
 no time to activate my nico and me 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.850
 and my helicopter pilot if I'm wrong 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.080
 not yeah I think it's that name so 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.220
 frankly I really was shocked 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.050
 it's really the parts my geese 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.360
 express but you experts a greatness 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.410
 so there in passing my first death I 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.180
 made myself you're in the back summer 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.709
 last on keenly actually guys 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.450
 Well, I'm just back to what I said 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.890
 in the beginning 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.600
 when you want 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.560
 did not seem to be processing some of 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.910
 search and destruction but in 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.010
 domination when you take a break 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.780
 of domination that make appear your 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.750
 frankly allies it can be really 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.190
 interesting for xp but a max in 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.800
 this in this part there the wages and 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.720
 prestige a level 68 to half of 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.470
 our 60 if I'm not mistaken and in the end 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.010
 Of the game 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.380
 I had my geese or the xp but it's 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.850
 grace and serious beauty just says what 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.920
 that when you take a break so a 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.410
 pause a humiliation it's over 1500 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.300
 echoes a kill if I'm wrong 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.220
 you will see in the game wait I 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.690
 look there I do the they see 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.000
 we're doing a fifties guys that's 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.730
 more if they use it even more than 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.440
 as well as the coc looking for it and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.049
 rescue so really really this mode 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.150
 is really pretty interesting I am 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.220
 really glad they innovated at 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.049
 level of the usual game modes of 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.820
 always see the same the same modes 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.010
 there frankly they innovate well of 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.750
 contented chamant it's really great 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.709
 pleasure to see a mode we can really 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.560
 xp pretty quickly there i think play it 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.090
 a lot during this weekend there in eat 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.600
 how of this video is saturday 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.030
 afternoon 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.100
 I think you pod Monday for the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.040
 spurs which is community channels 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.000
 we'll see if the fire the pack already 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.190
 I hope in any case that we comments 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.850
 stop for now is suitable for video 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.720
 as I do not start and youtube are pretty much 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.310
 nearly three to four months 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.140
 I think now I'm pretty at 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.180
 comfortable at the level of how atari but 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.950
 many times I make small fires 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.289
 small mistakes of french excuse me 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.940
 and that's it that's got me a lot of 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.979
 people criticize me already because 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.180
 I was already on cocef and a lot 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.220
 people criticized me but hey 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.620
 I hope my comment please you 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.890
 enthusiasts of the subject so for what 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.650
 there is the game scheme you saw well 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.630
 that for example the the position c if I 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.610
 do not deceive me you have or imposition 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.560
 Norman is not there lÃ© Ghana - are 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.110
 no position here it's really 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.330
 random flags so the most 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.850
 rated only 1500 points is incredible 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.470
 no, but when I make a kit over 500 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.390
 it's really me once one 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.190
 made them worried I won six years and 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.810
 there I won 500 it may be 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.920
 random but frankly guys this 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.750
 fashion it is really huge 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.250
 it's videos I do it because 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.890
 you xp you the stuff of phew 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.930
 I hope in any case that I helped you 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.670
 it's a game should add a little 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.700
 trick in this video I advise you 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.860
 to play in assault or so in 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.680
 specialists spadice specialist 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.090
 who will help you 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.740
 xp even faster because everything 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.030
 simply that when you blocks to a 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.700
 trump you know well you have a little 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.490
 specialist bonuses and balla with that's 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.440
 we kill with 1500 more 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.450
 done that you equip the grave 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.190
 a phew thing I think I had 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.770
 rest everything I think I did nineteen 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.450
 thousand xpg I think I made twenty 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.160
 thousand to 21 min xp damage the end of the 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.380
 part i have not let the hunger show 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.870
 frankly it would have been really 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.310
 interesting to show you that I have not 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.740
 does a lot of going to mans but 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.240
 as I meant this this game mode 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.520
 the cases I 'm going to shoe all this weekend 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.170
 I'm going to go serious but the levels 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.690
 I already have to make incompressible say 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.950
 the oars it's true that I have when I 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.790
 did not play well I really want to 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.320
 play for xp and you 're precise 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.600
 I say this max level is really at 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.910
 it sucks in that way there I 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.960
 I redo the he knows more 500 you 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.450
 you could cause glances from 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.090
 xp objects but something more than 1500 phew 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.849
 still the buckling not his prestige 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.459
 here I was really at half of 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.259
 from the end of level 60 so here is this 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:22.729
 gameplay will soon end it was 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.589
 in any case that you liked it I will 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.300
 just repeated a little bit the features 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:28.550
 of this game mode all the guys that's 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.309
 an interrupt recharge mix a 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.050
 little with domination if you die 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:34.339
 you can finally you can go can 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.209
 make you reappear simply by 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:38.209
 taking a break 

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:40.399
 you have noticed that we will win 4 to 1 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:41.929
 I believe in this game here is the part 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.429
 ends i hope in any case that she 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:44.689
 you liked it do not hesitate to put a 

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:46.550
 small live for my courage and that's me 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.860
 would really be great fun and a 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.389
 little comment a little by task that 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.759
 worth nothing guys it really does 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.679
 super fun it would allow badie to do 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.659
 advance even more on youtube so 

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:58.729
