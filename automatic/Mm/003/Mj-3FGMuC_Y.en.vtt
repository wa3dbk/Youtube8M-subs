00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
thing that falls apart can't support the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
thing that falls apart can't support the
full<00:00:42.629> weight<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.960> tomato<00:00:43.260> sometimes<00:00:44.129> ends

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
up flopping over it just really is not
the<00:00:47.370> best<00:00:47.700> thing<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> use<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> want<00:00:49.200> your

look at that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.660 
look at that
that's<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.379> typical<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.370> tomato

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that's that's very typical of the tomato

that's that's very typical of the tomato
cage<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.210> starts<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> fall<00:00:58.230> apart<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.829> there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
cage it starts to fall apart right there

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
cage it starts to fall apart right there
at<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> base<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.140> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
at the base of it and you know it's just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
at the base of it and you know it's just
not<00:01:01.620> worth<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.270> let's<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.390> rid<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> this

stretch<00:03:33.819> top<00:03:34.209> because<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.989> also<00:03:35.549> moves<00:03:36.549> and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
stretch top because it also moves and

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.920 
stretch top because it also moves and
allows<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.180> plant<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.480> grow<00:03:37.750> without

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930
