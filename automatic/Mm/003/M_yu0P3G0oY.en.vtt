00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.350
 somehow there is a bow in every tree 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 gerhard wiedemann has this insight 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 to his mission since five 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.339
 the native bayer transforms years 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.740
 domestic robinia and ash trees in 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.750
 Handmade bow on the bow 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.630
 former railway depot Lichtenberg 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 east of today's painting shops is the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 bow maker the most exotic among the around 60 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:33.120
 other artists now I look where the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 could lie further bow and there 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.649
 I look where are the first ones in where has with 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.370
 effect what is just as ideal here is the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.769
 amazon nub here was once a branch is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.589
 the ticker has grown after the 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.539
 be a handle 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.170
 After a rough look it's rough 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.300
 blessings of hard and tedious wood 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 then the 37-year-old draws the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.769
 profile of the bow on the robinia 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.969
 certainly come somehow the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.979
 tree where it's at 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.009
 I can not do it this way now 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.829
 that I just run out and with that 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.189
 planed then he would work out this 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.740
 Breaking would be weakened 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.049
 and again the saw attacks now it applies 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.840
 the character of the bow continues 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.000
 to work out the sample will come 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.920
 little by little to the filigree krÃ¼mmling 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 if he really holds and the bow what 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 Good to be checked again with this one 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.740
 self-built adventurous 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.829
 construction 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.110
 because wiedemann has the bow over 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.420
 a retraining to the working therapist 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.189
 The skilled electrician finally came 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.979
 for bow building I have general mr 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.720
 interest in wood on nature and this 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.689
 connect that the pure 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.539
 This arch fascinated me 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.390
 also that this sports equipment earlier 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.310
 it was a weapon very old and the one 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.869
 Connection there is a fascination 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.679
 I grew up more and more 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.500
 he pursued a fascination 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:12.640
 in bow building courses continue with 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:14.680
 such results and is shot 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.650
 of course on the former 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.870
 railway terrain meet bow fans and 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.860
 refine with wiedemanns help that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.170
 hit the elbow home 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.860
 right now really fingers up to 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 draw the mouth angle 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.310
 but it can not be on the ground 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.970
 because of its harmony and character 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.970
 bow maker wiedemann on the finest 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.970
 worked out
