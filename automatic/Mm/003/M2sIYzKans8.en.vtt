too<00:00:55.980> many<00:00:56.100> decks<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.899> expecting<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> foil<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
too many decks I'm expecting the foil of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.779 
too many decks I'm expecting the foil of
this<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.739> rather<00:00:59.010> expensive<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.609> already

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this to be rather expensive it already

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.729 
this to be rather expensive it already
is<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.210> expensive<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.440> vintage

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is really expensive because of vintage

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
is really expensive because of vintage
I'm<00:01:02.370> expecting<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> foil<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.270> remain<00:01:03.809> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I'm expecting the foil to remain in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
I'm expecting the foil to remain in
price<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.559> high<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> even<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> regulars

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
price pretty high and even the regulars

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
price pretty high and even the regulars
to<00:01:06.299> stay<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.200> over<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> buck<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:07.860> two<00:01:07.890> just

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to stay you know over a buck or two just

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
to stay you know over a buck or two just
because<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.850> their<00:01:08.970> use<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.390> probably<00:01:09.689> they

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
because of their use so probably they

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.469 
because of their use so probably they
could<00:01:10.080> even<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> 55<00:01:11.460> plus<00:01:11.729> depending<00:01:12.119> on

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
could even be up to 55 plus depending on

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
could even be up to 55 plus depending on
just<00:01:13.200> how<00:01:13.350> powerful<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.100> they

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
just how powerful they are when they

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.219 
just how powerful they are when they
originally<00:01:14.369> printed<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:15.479> were<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.840> strong

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
originally printed they were not strong

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
originally printed they were not strong
enough<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> format<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> deal<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.490> Jace

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
enough in the format to deal with Jace

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.730 
enough in the format to deal with Jace
because<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.720> couldn't<00:01:18.930> handle<00:01:19.080> vanity<00:01:19.560> but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
because they couldn't handle vanity but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
because they couldn't handle vanity but
at<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:19.950> point<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.250> don't<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.640> manly<00:01:20.909> around

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.469 
could very well be the black green theme
right<00:05:07.849> there<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.330> then<00:05:09.280> Jase<00:05:10.280> looking<00:05:11.240> very

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
right there and then Jase looking very

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.950 
right there and then Jase looking very
Jase<00:05:11.900> like<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.620> rest<00:05:12.800> we<00:05:12.919> rained<00:05:13.099> on<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.340> art

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
Jase like the rest we rained on the art

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.740 
Jase like the rest we rained on the art
then<00:05:14.960> we<00:05:15.139> have<00:05:15.289> this<00:05:15.710> card<00:05:16.150> 64<00:05:17.150> an<00:05:17.300> enchantment

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
then we have this card 64 an enchantment

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.920 
then we have this card 64 an enchantment
that<00:05:17.960> being<00:05:18.800> in<00:05:18.860> combat<00:05:19.070> if<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.550> have<00:05:19.849> all<00:05:20.300> the

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
that being in combat if you have all the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.659 
that being in combat if you have all the
highest<00:05:21.199> power<00:05:21.560> creatures<00:05:21.860> you<00:05:22.340> can<00:05:22.520> take

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
highest power creatures you can take

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.350 
highest power creatures you can take
control<00:05:22.940> of<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.960> creature<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.680> tap<00:05:24.889> it<00:05:25.099> and

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
control of a creature and on tap it and

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.480 
control of a creature and on tap it and
why<00:05:26.360> okay<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.080> don't<00:05:27.229> really<00:05:27.620> know<00:05:28.099> why<00:05:28.250> this<00:05:28.310> is

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
why okay I don't really know why this is

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.670 
why okay I don't really know why this is
I<00:05:28.909> think<00:05:29.509> as<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.630> don't<00:05:29.840> come<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.169> it's<00:05:30.289> decent

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
I think as I don't come and it's decent

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.320 
I think as I don't come and it's decent
I<00:05:30.919> don't<00:05:31.370> think<00:05:31.520> it's<00:05:31.639> a<00:05:31.699> great<00:05:31.820> card<00:05:32.120> though

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
I don't think it's a great card though

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.810 
I don't think it's a great card though
because<00:05:32.659> if<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:34.099> have<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.370> greatest<00:05:34.550> power

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
because if you have the greatest power

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.680 
because if you have the greatest power
creatures<00:05:35.199> then<00:05:36.199> you're<00:05:36.500> probably<00:05:37.690> winning

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
creatures then you're probably winning

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.260 
creatures then you're probably winning
and<00:05:39.020> in<00:05:39.889> this<00:05:40.009> case<00:05:40.190> this<00:05:40.400> car<00:05:40.610> just<00:05:40.639> snacks<00:05:41.090> on

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
and in this case this car just snacks on

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.399 
and in this case this car just snacks on
top<00:05:41.389> of<00:05:41.509> winning<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:41.900> don't<00:05:42.080> think<00:05:42.229> it's<00:05:42.349> that

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
top of winning I don't think it's that

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.219 
top of winning I don't think it's that
awesome<00:05:43.360> then<00:05:44.360> we<00:05:44.449> have<00:05:44.570> this<00:05:44.719> card<00:05:44.930> endless

control its sorcery speed but still with
convoke<00:05:53.990> I<00:05:54.169> think<00:05:54.380> this<00:05:54.469> could<00:05:54.650> find<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.889> place

convoke I think this could find a place
Eh<00:05:55.340> commander<00:05:55.930> question<00:05:56.930> whether<00:05:57.050> it's<00:05:57.199> going

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
Eh commander question whether it's going

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.779 
Eh commander question whether it's going
to<00:05:57.380> make<00:05:57.469> reanimator<00:05:57.979> viable<00:05:58.460> because<00:05:58.550> it's

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
to make reanimator viable because it's

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.390 
to make reanimator viable because it's
any<00:05:58.969> graveyard<00:05:59.539> not<00:06:00.080> quite<00:06:00.289> sure<00:06:00.320> but<00:06:00.800> it's

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
any graveyard not quite sure but it's

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.980 
any graveyard not quite sure but it's
definitely<00:06:01.550> interesting<00:06:02.180> use<00:06:02.509> of<00:06:02.539> convoke

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
definitely interesting use of convoke

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.800 
definitely interesting use of convoke
another<00:06:03.949> convoke<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:05.150> would<00:06:05.389> be<00:06:05.509> probably

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
another convoke this would be probably

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.170 
another convoke this would be probably
as<00:06:06.020> powerful<00:06:06.469> as<00:06:06.650> dispatch<00:06:07.159> if<00:06:07.460> it<00:06:07.699> was<00:06:07.880> one

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180
