your<00:03:48.870> corners<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:50.329> that's<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.829> so<00:03:52.829> for<00:03:53.670> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
your corners and that's that so for the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.580 
your corners and that's that so for the
centerpiece<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.359> last<00:03:54.570> one<00:03:54.870> all<00:03:55.290> you're

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
going to do for this will actually this

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.640 
going to do for this will actually this
I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.390> that's<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.630> most<00:03:57.750> mods<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.230> you're

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
I think that's the most mods and you're

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.440 
I think that's the most mods and you're
going<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.799> need<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.040> jumble<00:03:59.340> for<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.579> let's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
going to need a jumble for this let's

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.660 
going to need a jumble for this let's
get<00:04:00.570> down<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.810> focus<00:04:01.730> there<00:04:02.730> we<00:04:02.880> go<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.840> now

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
get down the focus there we go so now

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.080 
get down the focus there we go so now
these<00:04:05.720> ridges<00:04:06.720> on<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.900> side<00:04:07.200> on<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:08.370> right

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
these ridges on the side on the right

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.960 
these ridges on the side on the right
that<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.359> see<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:09.660> little<00:04:09.900> lines<00:04:10.200> now<00:04:11.130> it's

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
that you see these little lines now it's

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.420 
that you see these little lines now it's
not<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.269> sharpest<00:04:12.750> but<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.410> know<00:04:13.530> it's<00:04:14.190> still

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
not the sharpest but you know it's still

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.620 
not the sharpest but you know it's still
kind<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.760> sharp<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.150> want<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.359> get<00:04:15.450> rid<00:04:15.570> of

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
kind of sharp you want to get rid of

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.380 
kind of sharp you want to get rid of
those<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.250> what<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> did<00:04:17.519> I<00:04:17.670> use<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.820> dremel<00:04:18.090> and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
those I what I did I use a dremel and

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.630 
those I what I did I use a dremel and
just<00:04:18.540> rounded<00:04:19.019> them<00:04:19.140> out<00:04:19.320> on<00:04:19.590> both<00:04:20.160> sides<00:04:20.430> ran

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
just rounded them out on both sides ran

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.280 
just rounded them out on both sides ran
in<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.850> mountain<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.150> did<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.420> to<00:04:21.600> all<00:04:21.720> them

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
in the mountain I did that to all them

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.170 
in the mountain I did that to all them
on<00:04:22.560> each<00:04:22.860> edge<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.750> center<00:04:25.290> piece<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:26.180> think

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
on each edge of the center piece I think

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.330 
on each edge of the center piece I think
you<00:04:27.240> should<00:04:27.420> do<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.620> don't<00:04:28.770> have<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:30.050> now

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
you should do that you don't have to now

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.160 
you should do that you don't have to now
that's<00:04:32.340> going<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.580> take<00:04:32.670> some<00:04:32.910> time<00:04:33.420> but<00:04:33.960> once

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
that's going to take some time but once

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.000 
that's going to take some time but once
you<00:04:34.230> know<00:04:34.320> with<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.470> everything<00:04:34.860> else<00:04:34.889> is

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
you know with that everything else is

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.580 
you know with that everything else is
easy<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:36.210> now<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.420> got<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.780> bottom<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
easy so now you got the bottom of the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.590 
easy so now you got the bottom of the
piece<00:04:37.770> now<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.400> see<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:38.820> part<00:04:39.389> where<00:04:39.540> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
piece now you see this part where the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.390 
piece now you see this part where the
screw<00:04:39.810> goes<00:04:39.960> through<00:04:40.260> it's<00:04:40.980> kind<00:04:41.100> of<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.250> an

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
screw goes through it's kind of like an

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.830 
screw goes through it's kind of like an
octagon<00:04:41.700> shape<00:04:42.030> with<00:04:42.210> their<00:04:42.330> sharp<00:04:42.480> sides

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
octagon shape with their sharp sides

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.420 
octagon shape with their sharp sides
what<00:04:43.710> you're<00:04:43.800> going<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:43.980> do<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:44.130> going<00:04:44.340> to

going<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.880> smooth<00:04:48.060> them<00:04:48.150> out<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.660> can<00:04:48.780> use

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
going to smooth them out you can use

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.210 
going to smooth them out you can use
sandpaper<00:04:49.170> to<00:04:49.500> smooth<00:04:49.740> them<00:04:49.830> out<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.130> know
