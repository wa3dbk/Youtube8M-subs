00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 and me 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.120
 or the one that makes you look at what I have mounted 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.000
 I ride a party with this that 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.140
 call aside imagine of philips and in what 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.560
 consists 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.050
 next digital because it does not use or 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.920
 vinilos y da con estilo uses our 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.070
 iphone for that has two docking one in 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.900
 this side and another in this other what 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.060
 advantages has to be able to have two 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.770
 devices because you can listen 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.809
 different music as if you were 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.039
 playing with two real dishes for 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.399
 that what we have to do is move 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.930
 this is the cross baby the sign here 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.230
 it would be two 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.230
 and here we would go directly to the b 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.890
 but you can not only use your iphone or 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.560
 your ipod to control your music and 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.540
 make you a friend and this one also 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.090
 You can use other devices 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.170
 as for example a usb device already 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.170
 that has a connection here 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.350
 You can also use other metals 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 as for example with this connection 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.600
 minijack as you see here also 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 it also has then its album changes 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.590
 and such has a control cross here 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.800
 and this has it in both dishes with 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.900
 which you can control at the same time 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.030
 all vote music and very quickly and 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.670
 nothing with just one hand and flying then a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.490
 lots for the party to be complete 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 As you can see, it has a series of 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.729
 Lights that can be changed with the remote 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.310
 remote is to say that if you want a 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.890
 party of red tones because you ride the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.380
 party of red tones changing the color 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.570
 of the speakers you can put up 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.940
 four devices of these together what 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.759
 that would add then let's see if they are 300 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.170
 watts of power for each one thousand 200 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.789
 watts 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.910
 if the accounts that I think do not work out 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.950
 that I would not have enough power like 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.630
 so that your neighbors will either well the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.399
 rest of your life and of course like 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.220
 good dj table you can also do 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.510
 all effects your mixes and even 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.370
 can you do 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.280
 and this is done through a 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.229
 application that costs 079 also 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.180
 we can access another type of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.110
 functionalities such as 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.110
 audio effects 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.940
 there is no 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:27.680
 you have several to choose 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.680
 and then you also have the repetition 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.610
 these are the fatal ones but 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.270
 but also in other pills over here 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.160
 like for example a ticket for helmets 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.260
 as for example with what I carry 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.690
 right now they are very balls and here 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.330
 you have a switch to change helmets 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.980
 from one of the dishes to the other 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.050
 you also have two tickets 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.540
 microphone if you want to send it to 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.780
 sing or introduce what kind of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.820
 sounds directly through these 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.010
 connectors when you have a lot of 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.930
 options and you like music and you 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.830
 love having your friends entertained 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.830
 in a super party
