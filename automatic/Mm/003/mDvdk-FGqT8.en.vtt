00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.090
 Hello 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:13.059
 we are with you again I am called dmitry 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.480
 I wanted to tell you about my new 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.480
 incubator 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.070
 which 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.830
 here's just a few days ago 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.830
 the first bookmark has now been made 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.510
 literally today a little shade 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 tell on this machine 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.550
 development took site 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.890
 Marissa Grafchik 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.970
 really help me 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.410
 his advice 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:52.410
 that is, this machine incubator 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:55.290
 designed for 85 floors with 16 cells each 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.110
 for 16 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.110
 consists of a camera which I collected 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.910
 sandwich panels 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.179
 standing here 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.179
 polyurethane four 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.670
 penoplex 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.580
 computer 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.530
 a blog 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.430
 xm 236 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.430
 manages all processes 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.300
 thermometer 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.750
 shows the humidity of the air itself 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 MSU in the incubator 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.890
 yes breaststroke incubator 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.840
 rotation by means of a 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.030
 someone 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.100
 Chinese 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 750 newtons 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.440
 circulation fan 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 he pumped somewhere somewhere two 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.920
 half thousand 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.400
 football now 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.400
 we see 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.570
 fan 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.500
 purge which 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.390
 which cools the chamber 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.120
 between the air pumps 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.120
 Eliza here are these bottom holes 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.370
 the other side is worth 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.600
 there are flaps 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.280
 how are they dynamic merit 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.090
 down below 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.310
 there is a humidification system which is also 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.060
 sleep is made of 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.819
 aerodynamic damper and fan 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.380
 inside the bath is poured placed 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.600
 I go there 10 liters 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.840
 enough 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.459
 two days somewhere around 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.460
 then I try in the hatchery now 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.430
 humidity lift up 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.319
 here we see a little around here 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.819
 on house 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.420
 50 percent me foot mages 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.420
 humidity 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.470
 here 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.380
 here the control knob is obtained main 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.470
 fan stopped color 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.710
 inside the camera could 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.710
 appeared 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.480
 great 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 here 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.870
 Separate room 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.870
 split system set to maintain 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.260
 optimal climate then to climate on 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.409
 frying principle by day 36 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.510
 3834 near day 30 was that is for 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.880
 maintain the set temperature in 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.520
 an incubator 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.870
 need this system here here's another 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.870
 system controller now 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.780
 the next incubator will go 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.019
 here 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.290
 cell made and 12 plywood 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.810
 beautiful white color set mesh 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.780
 to support and 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.360
 for 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.360
 plastic for plaster 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.360
 I have this nickname for me to check 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.360
 testimony 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.639
 probably not see the sea 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.640
 will not be seen 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.740
 but the cell right now the lattice is softer not 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.900
 worth he see free now 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.190
 that is, she is ready just simply she 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.790
 Now here it is not worth the top 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.790
 another one 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.940
 here are the guides here 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.120
 did din reiki 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.360
 very handy thing 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.180
 some solid well here I have of course 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.270
 miss out 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.560
 a little customized 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.040
 but how are you the first such test machine 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.450
 the same 1 not painted caught when 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.450
 We painted it just was not 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.040
 that is, of course some 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.290
 mistakes I made it too wide 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.639
 and you had to me five centimeters 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:03.830
 already done to this here, this width 80 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:06.129
 centimeters and so it is my depth 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.369
 95 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:11.369
 so still idle the system will tell it 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.570
 top fan 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.300
 not worth it is the top output 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.300
 fan clock and i starred 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.640
 here we have a check valve to 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:37.270
 when saw incubator works to 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.240
 warm air here did not go out that is 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.550
 here it is a little thing to be tried here 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.490
 here I will be corrugated and court she 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.370
 it will be released that is, that all the waste 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:54.600
 the air we went outside to 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.600
 here we are to the battor and did not accumulate 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.120
 Here is such a machine 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.910
 well for the future 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.750
 all that will happen here 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:19.250
 shoot spread 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.250
 thank you all bye
