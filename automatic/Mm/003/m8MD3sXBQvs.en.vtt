00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
uses for four frags so anyone that

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.200 
uses for four frags so anyone that
hasn't<00:00:17.440> seen<00:00:17.680> it<00:00:17.800> before<00:00:17.920> this<00:00:18.190> is<00:00:18.250> my<00:00:18.550> 30

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
gallon frag tank it's a 48 inch tank

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.960 
gallon frag tank it's a 48 inch tank
it's<00:00:23.020> kind<00:00:23.230> of<00:00:23.260> messy<00:00:23.590> I<00:00:23.619> got<00:00:23.859> all<00:00:23.980> my<00:00:24.130> crap

it's kind of messy I got all my crap
kicking<00:00:25.359> around<00:00:25.480> but<00:00:26.320> it's<00:00:26.680> like<00:00:26.920> 48<00:00:27.369> inches<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
kicking around but it's like 48 inches I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.279 
kicking around but it's like 48 inches I
don't<00:00:30.760> actually<00:00:30.939> have<00:00:31.150> a<00:00:31.330> tape<00:00:31.750> measure<00:00:31.779> handy

to<00:00:32.410> tell<00:00:32.559> you<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.800> rest<00:00:32.950> of<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.160> dimensions

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670

anyways<00:00:34.120> it's<00:00:34.750> 30<00:00:35.079> gallons<00:00:35.590> so<00:00:36.550> I<00:00:36.850> guess<00:00:37.230> right

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
anyways it's 30 gallons so I guess right

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.120 
anyways it's 30 gallons so I guess right
off<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.559> start

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
off the start

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
I got a just a standard bio wheel filter

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.270 
I got a just a standard bio wheel filter
somehow<00:00:43.809> I've<00:00:44.079> lost<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.590> top<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:44.980> don't<00:00:45.160> know

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
somehow I've lost the top I don't know

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.389 
somehow I've lost the top I don't know
where<00:00:45.489> it's<00:00:45.610> possibly<00:00:46.120> gone<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:48.280> it's

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
where it's possibly gone but it's

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.950 
where it's possibly gone but it's
nothing<00:00:48.730> fancy<00:00:49.090> it's<00:00:49.120> just<00:00:49.390> your<00:00:49.540> normal

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960

run-of-the-mill<00:00:50.320> bio<00:00:50.890> wheel<00:00:51.960> gets<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.079> lot<00:00:53.230> of

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
run-of-the-mill bio wheel gets a lot of

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.130 
run-of-the-mill bio wheel gets a lot of
salt<00:00:53.559> creep<00:00:53.800> built<00:00:54.070> up<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.750> like<00:00:55.930> that

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
salt creep built up on it just like that

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.740 
salt creep built up on it just like that
so<00:00:56.410> I'll<00:00:56.730> well<00:00:57.730> I'm<00:00:57.879> here<00:00:58.030> I<00:00:58.059> will<00:00:58.329> take<00:00:58.570> that

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
so I'll well I'm here I will take that

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.439 
so I'll well I'm here I will take that
off<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:58.989> I'll<00:00:59.260> rinse<00:00:59.469> it<00:00:59.649> off<00:00:59.800> after<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.789> I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
off and I'll rinse it off after and I

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.690 
off and I'll rinse it off after and I
have<00:01:04.569> never<00:01:05.289> changed<00:01:05.499> the<00:01:05.799> wheel<00:01:05.950> itself<00:01:06.399> even

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
have never changed the wheel itself even

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.550 
have never changed the wheel itself even
when<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:06.999> slows<00:01:07.299> down<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.840> stuff<00:01:08.109> like<00:01:08.289> that<00:01:08.529> I

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
when it slows down and stuff like that I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.349 
when it slows down and stuff like that I
don't<00:01:08.979> what<00:01:09.249> it<00:01:09.369> tells<00:01:09.549> me<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.819> when<00:01:10.029> it<00:01:10.119> starts

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
don't what it tells me is when it starts

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.569 
don't what it tells me is when it starts
slowing<00:01:10.600> down<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.709> need<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.130> just<00:01:12.369> raise

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
slowing down that I need to just raise

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.370 
slowing down that I need to just raise
this<00:01:12.939> up<00:01:13.179> a<00:01:13.329> little<00:01:13.509> bit<00:01:13.719> normally<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
this up a little bit normally and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.359 
this up a little bit normally and
that'll<00:01:14.649> get<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.249> flow<00:01:15.579> going<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.060> little<00:01:16.179> more

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that'll get the flow going a little more

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.649 
that'll get the flow going a little more
sometimes<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.490> works<00:01:18.670> sometimes<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:19.179> doesn't

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
back on some algae I do change this

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.919 
back on some algae I do change this
maybe<00:01:33.099> every<00:01:33.700> six<00:01:33.969> to<00:01:34.060> eight<00:01:34.149> weeks<00:01:34.209> or<00:01:34.749> so

been<00:01:36.700> in<00:01:36.729> here<00:01:36.819> for<00:01:37.149> quite<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.389> while<00:01:37.599> you<00:01:38.229> can

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
been in here for quite a while you can

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.190 
been in here for quite a while you can
get<00:01:38.590> away<00:01:38.709> with<00:01:39.009> rinsing<00:01:39.490> them<00:01:39.639> a<00:01:40.240> couple<00:01:41.079> of

get away with rinsing them a couple of
times<00:01:41.259> too<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:42.069> don't<00:01:42.219> actually<00:01:42.369> always

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
times too so you don't actually always

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.249 
times too so you don't actually always
have<00:01:42.999> to<00:01:43.119> just<00:01:43.299> change<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.689> I've<00:01:43.810> had<00:01:43.959> pretty

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
have to just change it I've had pretty

have to just change it I've had pretty
good<00:01:44.349> luck<00:01:44.499> just<00:01:44.919> rinsing<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:46.679> so<00:01:47.679> that's<00:01:47.950> what

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
good luck just rinsing it so that's what

good luck just rinsing it so that's what
I<00:01:48.219> use<00:01:48.429> for<00:01:48.729> filtration<00:01:49.229> followed<00:01:50.229> up<00:01:50.439> with<00:01:50.469> a

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
I use for filtration followed up with a

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.260 
I use for filtration followed up with a
Red<00:01:51.789> Sea<00:01:51.999> skimmer<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:54.009> I<00:01:54.039> bought<00:01:54.340> off<00:01:54.369> kijiji

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
Red Sea skimmer that I bought off kijiji

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.609 
Red Sea skimmer that I bought off kijiji
it<00:01:55.359> didn't<00:01:55.599> even<00:01:55.689> have<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.929> lid<00:01:56.139> so<00:01:56.349> I<00:01:56.409> just

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
it didn't even have the lid so I just

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.679 
it didn't even have the lid so I just
used<00:01:56.799> an<00:01:56.889> old<00:01:57.009> crusty<00:01:57.279> see<00:01:57.759> their<00:01:57.909> old<00:01:58.149> CD<00:01:58.509> on

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
used an old crusty see their old CD on

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.929 
used an old crusty see their old CD on
it<00:01:58.869> which<00:01:59.349> you<00:01:59.469> can<00:01:59.559> see<00:01:59.679> is<00:01:59.739> nasty<00:02:00.159> while

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
it which you can see is nasty while

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.510 
it which you can see is nasty while
we're<00:02:01.119> doing<00:02:01.209> this<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:01.659> might<00:02:01.869> as<00:02:02.049> well

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
we're doing this we might as well

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.679 
we're doing this we might as well
replace<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.939> I'm<00:02:04.119> sure<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.329> can<00:02:04.539> find

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
replace that I'm sure I can find

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.060 
replace that I'm sure I can find
something<00:02:04.929> else<00:02:05.109> to<00:02:05.289> put<00:02:05.409> onto<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.770> now

something else to put onto it now
gone<00:02:06.400> pretty<00:02:06.610> gross<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:09.340> definitely<00:02:09.910> not

the<00:02:10.420> best<00:02:10.840> skimmer<00:02:11.530> out<00:02:11.860> there<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:14.650> it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
the best skimmer out there but it's

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.030 
the best skimmer out there but it's
doing<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.459> trick<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.780> know<00:02:16.990> any<00:02:17.260> old<00:02:17.470> use

doing the trick so you know any old use

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.070 
doing the trick so you know any old use
thing<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.580> find<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:19.000> Craigslist<00:02:19.180> or<00:02:19.900> one

of the fish forms good enough not enough
that<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.290> doesn't<00:02:23.470> need<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:23.890> fancy<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.400> just

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
that it doesn't need to be fancy it just

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.890 
that it doesn't need to be fancy it just
needs<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.940> work<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.430> create<00:02:27.880> just<00:02:28.450> standard

egg<00:02:29.080> crate<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:30.310> actually<00:02:31.150> use<00:02:31.420> silver<00:02:31.840> because

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
egg crate I actually use silver because

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.750 
egg crate I actually use silver because
that's<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.350> had<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.310> put<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.700> my

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
that's what I had and I put it in my

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.940 
that's what I had and I put it in my
bathtub<00:02:33.970> for<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.510> couple<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.870> days<00:02:35.020> like<00:02:35.830> I'd

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
bathtub for a couple of days like I'd

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.500 
bathtub for a couple of days like I'd
take<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.250> out<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.550> use<00:02:36.670> shower<00:02:36.940> obviously<00:02:37.360> and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
take it out to use shower obviously and

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.120 
take it out to use shower obviously and
refill<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.110> with<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> bit<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.410> salt<00:02:38.650> water<00:02:38.800> I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
refill it but with a bit of salt water I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.760 
refill it but with a bit of salt water I
just<00:02:40.060> grab<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.270> cup<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.660> salt<00:02:40.900> mix<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.440> you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
just grab a cup of salt mix it in you

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.310 
just grab a cup of salt mix it in you
know<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> quarter<00:02:42.100> tub<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.720> water<00:02:43.720> because<00:02:44.080> I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
know a quarter tub of water because I

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.120 
know a quarter tub of water because I
think<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.650> salt<00:02:44.890> helps<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.570> chrome<00:02:46.840> off

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
think the salt helps get the chrome off

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.530 
think the salt helps get the chrome off
so<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.489> second<00:02:48.850> time<00:02:48.970> I've<00:02:49.150> used<00:02:49.180> this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
so this is a second time I've used this

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.010 
so this is a second time I've used this
kind<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.840> egg<00:02:49.959> crate<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.690> second

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
kind of egg crate and it's the second

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.390 
kind of egg crate and it's the second
time<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.170> I've<00:02:53.380> got<00:02:53.560> algae<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.220> it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
time that I've got algae on it

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.490 
time that I've got algae on it
afterwards<00:02:54.940> but<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.510> don't<00:02:55.810> worry<00:02:56.020> about<00:02:56.350> it

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
afterwards but I don't worry about it

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.560 
afterwards but I don't worry about it
whatever<00:02:56.680> it'll<00:02:57.010> go<00:02:57.190> away<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:58.180> there's<00:02:58.390> some

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
whatever it'll go away so there's some

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.210 
whatever it'll go away so there's some
algae<00:02:58.900> on<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.200> I'm<00:02:59.320> going<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.530> rip<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.040> apart

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
algae on it I'm going to rip it apart

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.520 
algae on it I'm going to rip it apart
and<00:03:00.550> I'll<00:03:00.610> wash<00:03:00.820> that<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.870> egg<00:03:02.500> crate<00:03:02.830> and

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
and I'll wash that the egg crate and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.259 
and I'll wash that the egg crate and
throw<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.650> back<00:03:05.800> in<00:03:06.040> maybe<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.940> weekend

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
throw it back in maybe this weekend

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.759 
throw it back in maybe this weekend
coming<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.900> get<00:03:08.050> around<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.440> doing<00:03:08.650> that

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
coming I can get around to doing that

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.330 
coming I can get around to doing that
clean<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.190> up<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.459> bit

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
clean it up a bit

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.100 
clean it up a bit
other<00:03:12.340> than<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.610> I've<00:03:12.880> just<00:03:13.150> got<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> heater

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
other than that I've just got a heater

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.660 
other than that I've just got a heater
there<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.709> don't<00:03:14.890> even<00:03:14.980> think<00:03:15.100> kicks<00:03:15.489> on

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
there that I don't even think kicks on

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.580 
there that I don't even think kicks on
very<00:03:15.910> often<00:03:16.330> though<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.930> pretty<00:03:17.110> warm<00:03:17.440> in

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
very often though it's pretty warm in

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.490 
very often though it's pretty warm in
here<00:03:17.799> temperature<00:03:18.760> stays<00:03:19.030> pretty<00:03:19.410> consistent

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
an old power head right there just

have to have I don't even know why I

really put it in there it's just kind of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.020 
really put it in there it's just kind of
it's<00:03:42.340> one<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.519> those<00:03:42.610> things<00:03:42.790> that's<00:03:42.910> just

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
happened so maybe one day it'll come out

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.780 
happened so maybe one day it'll come out
and<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.680> but<00:03:47.799> it's<00:03:47.890> good<00:03:48.070> spot<00:03:48.280> for<00:03:48.310> stuff<00:03:48.700> like

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
and I but it's good spot for stuff like

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.240 
and I but it's good spot for stuff like
the<00:03:49.030> Sun<00:03:49.570> set<00:03:49.810> montipora<00:03:50.320> it's<00:03:50.739> hard<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.070> see

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
the Sun set montipora it's hard to see

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.460

right<00:03:51.400> now<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.579> got<00:03:51.820> some<00:03:52.030> salt<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.260> glass

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
right now I got some salt on the glass

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.569 
right now I got some salt on the glass
and<00:03:53.769> stuff<00:03:53.950> but<00:03:55.350> that's<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.709> then<00:03:57.070> you

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
and stuff but that's it and then you

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.310 
and stuff but that's it and then you
know<00:03:57.700> if<00:03:57.880> you<00:03:58.000> end<00:03:58.329> up<00:03:58.510> like<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.900> did<00:03:58.959> with

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
know if you end up like I did with

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.160 
know if you end up like I did with
growth<00:03:59.620> on<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.130> on<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.269> old<00:04:01.420> egg<00:04:01.660> crate<00:04:01.930> well

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
growth on the on the old egg crate well

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.199 
growth on the on the old egg crate well
then<00:04:02.320> you<00:04:02.410> can<00:04:02.530> keep<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.730> creates<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
then you can keep it this it creates the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.780

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
bucks and then a set of these moon

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.780 
bucks and then a set of these moon
lights<00:04:43.030> which<00:04:44.030> are<00:04:45.430> let's<00:04:46.430> get<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.700> the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
lights which are let's get to the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.810 
lights which are let's get to the
controller<00:04:49.240> right<00:04:50.240> there<00:04:50.480> fishbowl<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:51.820> so

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
controller right there fishbowl and so

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.230 
controller right there fishbowl and so
automatic<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:54.320> where<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.860> simulates<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.820> 30<00:04:56.060> day

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.400 
automatic is where it simulates a 30 day
moon<00:04:56.510> cycle<00:04:57.410> or<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:58.400> can<00:04:58.550> just<00:04:58.700> go<00:04:58.850> max<00:04:59.230> if<00:05:00.230> I

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
moon cycle or you can just go max if I

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.690 
moon cycle or you can just go max if I
click<00:05:00.680> at<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.860> max<00:05:01.100> like<00:05:01.400> they're<00:05:01.550> on<00:05:01.670> a

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
click at the max like they're on a

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.250 
click at the max like they're on a
dimmer<00:05:02.030> I<00:05:02.150> don't<00:05:02.450> know<00:05:02.540> if<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.720> guys<00:05:02.810> can<00:05:03.050> see

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
everything I've got in there I can fit

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.020 
everything I've got in there I can fit
lots<00:05:53.590> if<00:05:54.590> I<00:05:54.680> wanted<00:05:54.980> to<00:05:55.070> reorganize<00:05:55.640> a<00:05:55.670> bit<00:05:56.000> I

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
lots if I wanted to reorganize a bit I

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.640 
lots if I wanted to reorganize a bit I
could<00:05:56.330> probably<00:05:56.600> fit<00:05:56.870> some<00:05:57.050> more<00:05:57.230> if<00:05:57.350> I<00:05:57.440> get

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
could probably fit some more if I get

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.390 
could probably fit some more if I get
that<00:05:57.800> plate<00:05:58.070> out<00:05:58.100> of<00:05:58.430> there<00:05:58.670> and<00:05:59.530> a<00:06:00.530> few<00:06:01.280> other

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
that plate out of there and a few other

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.220 
that plate out of there and a few other
things<00:06:01.730> I<00:06:01.910> could<00:06:01.970> always<00:06:02.180> if<00:06:02.570> I<00:06:02.690> wish<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:03.050> loose

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
things I could always if I wish to loose

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.500 
things I could always if I wish to loose
the<00:06:03.410> rock<00:06:03.620> I<00:06:03.890> could<00:06:04.100> almost<00:06:04.820> double<00:06:05.210> the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
the rock I could almost double the

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.640 
the rock I could almost double the
amount<00:06:05.540> of<00:06:05.780> frag<00:06:06.020> space<00:06:07.810> so<00:06:08.810> yeah<00:06:09.200> that's<00:06:09.500> it

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
amount of frag space so yeah that's it

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.970 
amount of frag space so yeah that's it
hopefully<00:06:10.100> that<00:06:10.280> helps<00:06:10.550> me<00:06:10.760> if<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:11.210> were

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
hopefully that helps me if you were

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.620 
hopefully that helps me if you were
thinking<00:06:12.980> on<00:06:13.280> doing<00:06:13.550> it<00:06:13.640> it's<00:06:13.850> a<00:06:14.120> pretty<00:06:14.330> easy

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
thinking on doing it it's a pretty easy

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.660 
thinking on doing it it's a pretty easy
way<00:06:14.840> to<00:06:14.900> set<00:06:15.200> it<00:06:15.230> up<00:06:15.440> try<00:06:16.190> to<00:06:16.220> keep<00:06:16.340> it<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.640> little

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
way to set it up try to keep it a little

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.260 
way to set it up try to keep it a little
cleaner<00:06:17.030> than<00:06:17.150> I<00:06:17.330> keep<00:06:17.570> this<00:06:17.780> I<00:06:17.990> guess<00:06:18.200> but<00:06:18.500> and

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
cleaner than I keep this I guess but and

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.490 
cleaner than I keep this I guess but and
tidy<00:06:20.270> up<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.540> wires<00:06:20.750> maybe<00:06:21.080> get<00:06:21.320> them<00:06:21.410> away

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
tidy up the wires maybe get them away

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.909 
tidy up the wires maybe get them away
from<00:06:21.770> the<00:06:21.920> water<00:06:22.180> probably<00:06:23.180> a<00:06:23.330> good<00:06:23.450> idea

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
from the water probably a good idea

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.080 
from the water probably a good idea
alright<00:06:24.919> guys<00:06:25.130> that's<00:06:25.430> it<00:06:25.610> thanks<00:06:26.030> for
