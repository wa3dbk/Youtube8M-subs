00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
in order to get on xbox live is you need

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.510 
in order to get on xbox live is you need
to<00:02:03.299> bridge<00:02:03.659> these<00:02:04.020> two<00:02:04.290> connections<00:02:04.890> it's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
to bridge these two connections it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850 
to bridge these two connections it's
very<00:02:05.880> easy<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.600> all<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
very easy to do all you have to do is

very easy to do all you have to do is
hold<00:02:08.129> down<00:02:08.190> control<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:08.879> click<00:02:09.140> both

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
hold down control and click both

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.280 
hold down control and click both
connections

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
connections

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.110 
connections
now<00:02:11.950> once<00:02:12.159> you<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.370> both<00:02:12.579> connections

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
now once you have both connections

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.270 
now once you have both connections
highlighted<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.959> simply<00:02:14.319> black<00:02:14.590> back<00:02:14.950> click

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
highlighted you simply black back click

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.339 
highlighted you simply black back click
and<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:16.299> click<00:02:16.510> bridge<00:02:17.019> connections<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.870> say

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
and you click bridge connections so say

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.569 
and you click bridge connections so say
a<00:02:20.379> needs<00:02:20.680> your<00:02:20.859> permission<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.280> continue

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
a needs your permission to continue

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.660 
a needs your permission to continue
simply<00:02:22.510> click<00:02:22.629> continue<00:02:23.349> takes<00:02:23.680> about<00:02:23.769> 15<00:02:24.459> to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
simply click continue takes about 15 to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.179 
simply click continue takes about 15 to
30<00:02:24.879> seconds<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.540> what<00:02:26.439> it's<00:02:26.590> doing<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:26.980> it's

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
30 seconds and what it's doing is it's

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.339 
30 seconds and what it's doing is it's
bridging<00:02:27.640> both<00:02:27.819> connections<00:02:28.359> so<00:02:29.049> that<00:02:29.079> your

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
bridging both connections so that your

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.699 
bridging both connections so that your
local<00:02:29.769> area<00:02:29.950> connection<00:02:30.609> your<00:02:31.060> xbox<00:02:31.510> 360<00:02:32.170> can

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
local area connection your xbox 360 can

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.550 
local area connection your xbox 360 can
use<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.099> wireless<00:02:33.310> network<00:02:33.760> internet<00:02:34.659> so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
use the wireless network internet so

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.740 
use the wireless network internet so
it's<00:02:35.829> very<00:02:36.099> easy<00:02:36.430> method<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.299> really<00:02:37.510> does

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
it's very easy method and it really does

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.589 
it's very easy method and it really does
work<00:02:38.099> so<00:02:39.099> after<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.730> done<00:02:39.760> should<00:02:40.569> be

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
work so after this is done should be

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.599 
work so after this is done should be
done<00:02:40.719> in<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:41.109> a<00:02:41.260> couple<00:02:41.379> seconds<00:02:41.889> you<00:02:42.459> should

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
done in just a couple seconds you should

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.640 
done in just a couple seconds you should
be<00:02:42.670> able<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.879> turn<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.090> your<00:02:43.329> xbox<00:02:43.599> 360<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:44.620> you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
be able to turn on your xbox 360 and you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.520 
be able to turn on your xbox 360 and you
should<00:02:45.280> be<00:02:45.430> able<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.639> log<00:02:45.819> on<00:02:46.000> xbox<00:02:46.389> live<00:02:46.599> so

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
should be able to log on xbox live so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.780 
should be able to log on xbox live so
this<00:02:47.829> will<00:02:47.980> save<00:02:48.189> you<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.579> hundred

network adapter the only thing you'll

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.399 
network adapter the only thing you'll
have<00:02:52.389> to<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:52.659> is<00:02:52.810> you'll<00:02:52.930> have<00:02:53.079> to<00:02:53.169> have<00:02:53.260> your

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
xbox 360 either plugged into your pc or

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.409 
xbox 360 either plugged into your pc or
your<00:02:56.500> laptop<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:57.220> mean<00:02:57.790> that's<00:02:57.939> not<00:02:58.180> really

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
your laptop I mean that's not really

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.240 
your laptop I mean that's not really
that<00:02:58.569> big<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.959> deal<00:02:59.139> and<00:02:59.379> you<00:02:59.769> save<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> lot<00:03:00.189> of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
that big of a deal and you save a lot of

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.050 
that big of a deal and you save a lot of
money<00:03:00.419> so<00:03:01.419> that's<00:03:02.079> it<00:03:02.409> it's<00:03:02.919> very<00:03:03.099> simple<00:03:03.459> this

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
money so that's it it's very simple this

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.270 
money so that's it it's very simple this
is<00:03:04.209> how<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.359> do<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.569> in<00:03:04.750> vista<00:03:05.139> and<00:03:05.290> XP<00:03:05.799> it's

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
is how you do it in vista and XP it's

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.710 
is how you do it in vista and XP it's
very<00:03:06.489> similar<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:07.030> just<00:03:07.209> need<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.419> find<00:03:07.569> your

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
very similar you just need to find your

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.970 
very similar you just need to find your
control<00:03:08.079> panel<00:03:08.439> and<00:03:08.530> your<00:03:08.650> network

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
control panel and your network

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.069 
control panel and your network
connections<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:10.239> simply<00:03:10.569> bridge<00:03:10.780> both

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
connections just simply bridge both

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.190 
connections just simply bridge both
connections<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.889> should<00:03:12.639> work<00:03:12.849> just<00:03:12.879> fine

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
connections and should work just fine

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.179 
connections and should work just fine
now<00:03:14.200> if<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.349> want<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.590> learn<00:03:14.650> about<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.010> other

now if you want to learn about the other

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.649 
now if you want to learn about the other
methods<00:03:15.639> I<00:03:15.879> can<00:03:16.030> do<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.239> completely

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
methods I can do it completely

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.140 
methods I can do it completely
