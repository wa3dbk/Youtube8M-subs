00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello I am olive tree his mullet at 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.640
 at the castle today we are tackling 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.880
 a crucial question that most 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.010
 of us French have not asked us 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.340
 the question of what when it smells like 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.960
 strawberry 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.000
 there are really strawberries in the wine 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.850
 does it smell like kiwifruit? 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.119
 really kiwi in it the answer is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.470
 no 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.520
 I'm afraid then the first thing 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.439
 is that you really have to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
 to feel guilty about all these 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 flavor stories to most people 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.560
 who are a little bit frustrated with that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 have the most comfortable most of the time 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.260
 it's because they read from three 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 books from three websites that are going 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.370
 explain to us that each grape goes 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.989
 come up with a type of aroma that is him 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.309
 specific a the sauvignon blanc against 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.040
 for example we use it 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 it's still very fruity on the log 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 the cabernet sauvignon in the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.010
 bordelais we have aromas of walls we have 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.410
 aromas of green pepper 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.410
 why do you drink a burgundy loses 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.480
 maybe a little green pepper here 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.160
 the same with the gewurztraminer that smells 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 the pink elite cheer you are on the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.629
 the nail the aperitif that you say that it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.280
 smell pink and lychee that's all that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.629
 it's not a big deal 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.769
 but the people the important thing is that he 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.490
 must be aware that we have not 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.810
 need all that to enjoy a wine 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.340
 the wine is really pleasure what so 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 no need to put words on it 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.650
 for to feast then a little 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.369
 still warms all its aromas in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.900
 the wine from where it comes 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.979
 So it's related to what is enough 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.990
 simple looking up are three families 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.920
 aroma the rounded primary secondary 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.299
 and tertiary 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.280
 so what are they the aromas 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.520
 primary is aromas actually says 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.530
 varietal in its traits to grape variety 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 that we use to make this or that wine 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.990
 so supposedly we said it's always 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.700
 Sauvignon Blanc 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.210
 so we will have a lot this 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.890
 freshness this citrus so every grape variety 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.240
 will bring its share of its batch of flavors 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 like when we ate a green apple 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.360
 it's still a little acidic 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.829
 when we are going to eat a red apple have 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.149
 aromas a little different so 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.770
 this is the first type of aroma 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.990
 second type of aroma for the second one 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.210
 is going to say it's actually aromas says 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 of fermentation ok the secondary weapons 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.560
 of fermentation so that means that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.750
 during our fermentation so the sugar 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.829
 becomes alcohol the co2 is released to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.159
 passage and so there is a whole kind of 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.899
 2 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.429
 molecular orders everything gets 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.649
 recombine is reforming if we tend 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.730
 the ear in in a barrel or in 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.470
 a tank during this phase of 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.420
 fermentation that lasts a few days there 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.430
 there are bulls in service to clear 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.970
 energy so new molecules are going 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.250
 form 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.049
 we recombine like that during this 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.220
 fermentation and therefore new aromas 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.080
 will appear 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.190
 when we say that a vincent strawberry ya 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.019
 no frescoes added by cons 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.400
 that it is a molecule that is the same 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.870
 which strongly resembles the molecule 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.549
 we will find in a strawberry so 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.030
 we find aromas that are 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.709
 Similar 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.150
 ok there is no truth about it and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.950
 that's why you can feel 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.760
 the ugly mans raspberry me there is no 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.980
 absolute truth 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.319
 you must not break your head 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.910
 on it the third type we saw the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.860
 primary aromas secondary aromas 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.110
 tertiary so the third type of aroma 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.030
 it's going to be so- called ripening aromas 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.220
 aging aromas so at 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.400
 as a wind is going to age the oxygen 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.230
 boom will go into our wine 1 by this 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.299
 plug which is so for them and is going 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.400
 come alter the structure the formula 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.319
 chemical of our wine and so are worth the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.609
 change so new flavors a 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.230
 small can cover the aromas 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.480
 primary and secondary schools that oppose 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.849
 to fill on the fruit on the aromas of 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.819
 youth and so its aromas will happen 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.160
 the aromas a little bit 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.160
 to cook aromas of 2 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.000
 tobacco cigar boxes 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.260
 all these things that comes with a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.490
 little time to give a little 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.200
 little time has it in so that's it 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.450
 after each wine is going to be actually the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.100
 meets all its aromas so the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.710
 aromas of the grape variety of the aromas of the 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.070
 fermentation and the aromas of the 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.500
 complicated maturation but ultimately 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.450
 quite simple so here it is really 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.430
 the hall and after if we want to have a 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.320
 little girl reading grid a little 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.790
 to a small toolbox for good 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.930
 understand how to get to these aromas 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.160
 it's easy enough 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.690
 the idea is that in fact we have to give 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.190
 a frame to his thinking it's because 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.750
 all that is the olfactory memory film 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.060
 black that we practice very rarely 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.010
 we do not use it often says it smells 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.740
 good feels not good we do not have fun at 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.750
 say that without a currant blueberry or 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.740
 the blackberry is rarely so precise 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.180
 in our conversations every day 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.650
 so the idea is to reason in terms 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.490
 of family then we will start with the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.170
 big families in there we take a drink 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.870
 since it is rather vegetable animal 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.060
 fruity-floral can do the same game in 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.230
 at you good here I say rather 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.359
 fruit then searched after that because 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.800
 is rather on rather pale colors 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.810
 the dark colors of fruit is this 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.419
 that it is rather of green yellow whites 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.620
 to black red as fruit color there 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.690
 the evidence is rather the colors 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.820
 light enough we do not have too many strawberries 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.290
 and raspberry so good me I see a 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.040
 little bit the citrus side good once 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.780
 we are in citrus 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.919
 well we can be more creative in unless 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.220
 to have less chance to make 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.169
 errors 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.670
 so here is the side a little bit 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.860
 green apple lime 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.060
 grapefruit all those things there that 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.980
 come out on that wind so here it is 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.680
 finally at first it seems a little 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.980
 uncomplicated and in fact we gave a 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.750
 hair of rationality another 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.610
 reasoning it is very easy 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.140
 to be more we worked on it more we 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.790
 better we will become but still a 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.420
 times there is absolutely no worry 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.310
 to have 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.380
 here I hope all these stories 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.440
 of aromas are now a little bit 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.320
 more clear and the important finally 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.750
 it is to appreciate his wine so I wear 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:21.920
 a toast to your good health and tell you 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.920
 see you soon on www.auplata.com thank you
