so<00:02:00.630> say<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.439> guy<00:02:01.649> will<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.250> more<00:02:02.490> use<00:02:02.700> for

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
so say this guy will have more use for

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.230 
so say this guy will have more use for
hover<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.509> active<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:05.040> focused<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> stuff

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
hover and active and focused and stuff

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.400 
hover and active and focused and stuff
like<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:08.149> something<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.750> does<00:02:10.080> have

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
like that something that this does have

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.630 
like that something that this does have
is<00:02:10.649> padding<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.489> margins<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
is padding and margins and the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.240 
is padding and margins and the
just<00:02:13.060> kinda<00:02:13.360> changes<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.740> looks<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
just kinda changes it looks like it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.860 
just kinda changes it looks like it
changes<00:02:15.580> position<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.420> basically

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
changes position but it's basically

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.550 
changes position but it's basically
adding<00:02:17.290> padding<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.510> are<00:02:19.959> not<00:02:20.200> sure<00:02:20.380> what

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
adding padding if you are not sure what

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.770 
adding padding if you are not sure what
that<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.860> it's<00:02:21.190> basically<00:02:21.310> space<00:02:22.150> from<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
that is it's basically space from the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.960 
that is it's basically space from the
left<00:02:22.959> or<00:02:23.170> right<00:02:23.319> well<00:02:24.130> from<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> left<00:02:24.610> side<00:02:24.790> in

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
left or right well from the left side in

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.230 
left or right well from the left side in
this<00:02:25.090> case<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:26.050> how<00:02:26.140> much<00:02:26.290> space<00:02:27.000> from<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
this case it's how much space from the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.690 
this case it's how much space from the
left<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.500> text<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> there's<00:02:32.680> padding<00:02:33.310> and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
left is the text so there's padding and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.430 
left is the text so there's padding and
margins<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.360> borders<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.720> all<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.140> kind<00:02:35.380> of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
margins and borders and all this kind of

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.010 
margins and borders and all this kind of
stuff<00:02:35.500> there's<00:02:36.280> also<00:02:36.520> other<00:02:37.120> things<00:02:37.510> like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
stuff there's also other things like

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.350 
stuff there's also other things like
alignment<00:02:38.739> where<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:38.980> can<00:02:39.280> say<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> line<00:02:40.000> lower

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
alignment where I can say a line lower

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.199 
alignment where I can say a line lower
right<00:02:40.630> or<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.900> line<00:02:41.489> middle<00:02:42.489> Center<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
right or a line middle Center and it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.420 
right or a line middle Center and it
will<00:02:43.330> align<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.840> middle<00:02:44.080> center<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
will align to the middle center of the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.160 
will align to the middle center of the
rectangle<00:02:45.730> if<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.480> remember<00:02:46.810> we<00:02:46.959> made<00:02:47.110> a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
rectangle if you remember we made a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.640 
rectangle if you remember we made a
rectangle<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.540> are<00:02:49.690> applying<00:02:49.930> this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
rectangle here that we are applying this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.300 
rectangle here that we are applying this
to<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.200> rectangle<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.950> might<00:02:54.130> be

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
to so it's in that rectangle it might be

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.000 
to so it's in that rectangle it might be
easier<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.790> do<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.080> button<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.209> let's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
easier to do this to a button so let's

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.949 
easier to do this to a button so let's
let's<00:03:00.010> go<00:03:00.400> into<00:03:00.670> our<00:03:00.700> code<00:03:01.030> where<00:03:01.360> we<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.630> GI

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
let's go into our code where we have GI

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.550 
let's go into our code where we have GI
label<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.950> let's<00:03:03.790> comment<00:03:04.239> out<00:03:04.570> this<00:03:05.230> UI

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
label and let's comment out this UI

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.350 
label and let's comment out this UI
label<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.220> let's<00:03:06.400> actually<00:03:06.580> turn<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.150> into<00:03:07.269> a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
label and let's actually turn it into a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.600 
label and let's actually turn it into a
button<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.019> we<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.260> see<00:03:08.590> kind<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.430> our

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
button just so we can see kind of our

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.850 
button just so we can see kind of our
padding<00:03:10.630> well<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.019> won't<00:03:11.170> actually<00:03:11.320> see<00:03:11.769> it

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
padding well we won't actually see it

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.620 
padding well we won't actually see it
you'll<00:03:12.730> notice<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.810> guess<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.450> more

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
you'll notice this I guess this is more

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.130 
you'll notice this I guess this is more
of<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.810> warning<00:03:17.049> than<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> lesson<00:03:17.829> at<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.310> point

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
of a warning than a lesson at this point

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.360 
of a warning than a lesson at this point
when<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.170> do<00:03:20.799> put<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.579> button<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:24.160> add

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
when you do put in a button and you add

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.210 
when you do put in a button and you add
a<00:03:24.400> style<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.810> button<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.320> not<00:03:26.890> gonna<00:03:27.100> be

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
a style that button is not gonna be

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.610 
a style that button is not gonna be
visible<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:28.360> can<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:28.959> that<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> doesn't

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
visible so you can see that it doesn't

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.150 
visible so you can see that it doesn't
have<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:29.950> blueish<00:03:30.600> outline<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.890> know

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
have this blueish outline and you know

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.710 
have this blueish outline and you know
that<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.489> switched<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> button<00:03:34.540> if

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
that we switched to this to a button if

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.560 
that we switched to this to a button if
we<00:03:34.930> were<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.260> take<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.980> public<00:03:36.760> style<00:03:37.299> and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
we were to take this public style and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.460 
we were to take this public style and
add<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.590> our<00:03:38.620> button<00:03:39.040> over<00:03:39.340> here<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.470> then

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
add it to our button over here and then

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.410 
add it to our button over here and then
take<00:03:41.709> this<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.220> put<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:42.940> end<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.329> our

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
take this and put it to the end of our

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.130 
take this and put it to the end of our
button<00:03:45.269> your<00:03:46.269> button<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.630> gonna<00:03:46.840> basically

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
button your button is gonna basically

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.190 
button your button is gonna basically
disappear<00:03:47.890> except<00:03:48.160> for<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.400> image<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.930> see

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
disappear except for the image you see

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.199 
disappear except for the image you see
how<00:03:50.320> that<00:03:50.410> went<00:03:50.500> away<00:03:50.620> that's<00:03:51.250> because<00:03:51.730> when

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
how that went away that's because when

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.020 
how that went away that's because when
we<00:03:52.329> use<00:03:52.570> GUI<00:03:52.900> style<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:54.030> everything

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
we use GUI style like this everything

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.530 
we use GUI style like this everything
goes<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.930> default<00:03:56.350> blinks<00:03:57.000> sorry<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.269> isn't

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
goes to default blinks sorry this isn't

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.259 
goes to default blinks sorry this isn't
the<00:03:58.600> right<00:03:58.690> one<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.519> style<00:04:00.519> on<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.940> button

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
the right one the style on the button

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.060 
the right one the style on the button
here<00:04:01.299> everything<00:04:02.019> goes<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.380> default<00:04:02.769> which<00:04:03.040> is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
here everything goes to default which is

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.940 
here everything goes to default which is
all<00:04:03.400> blank<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.530> that's<00:04:05.530> why<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:08.829> would

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
all blank and that's why it would

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.349 
all blank and that's why it would
disappear<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:10.209> beware<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:10.989> that<00:04:11.880> GUI<00:04:12.880> style
