00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.029
 the curators also count on psv in this video about performance 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.409
 of horses inwardly that use the application in training 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.829
 I will also give you some tips on how to do things during 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.089
 shunting 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.529
 so that your horse does not stand infinitely box just running laps in motion 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.469
 but so that staying there can really deliver a few days and the physical 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.670
 development 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.140
 where your horse 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 we use lodging for the following reasons 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.650
 It contains as a warm up before training to have damage going on 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.440
 and that is where we drive that horses that use 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.930
 very stuck in a bulky person who has difficulty releasing on spokes 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
 always horses that suffer from start-up problems 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.820
 and in preparation for work on the hand use pussy to put the body on 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.820
 the exercise is to warm up for the gymnasts 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.570
 I use the presence as a variation on the training so instead of driving 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 there is a day at work going on 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.050
 and I do use the accommodation address for a few days in a row on a horse 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.680
 exercise and keep it flexible 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.490
 but that the body can relax and recover from the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.690
 trainings 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.100
 so instead of releasing the horse completely and stopping you want 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.250
 very briefly I am moving both ways in trot and canter and that is it 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.580
 pekela 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.240
 and when your weather is very useful to use when training a young 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.990
 horse 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.060
 to make the animal so familiar with the voting aids and also competition and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.190
 build muscle strength 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.250
 Moreover, a very nice can be used to get excess energy 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.220
 to lose 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.729
 the loo steps 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.409
 that I married a couple embracing in peace is also pretty much with it 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.670
 I still ask little or no statement but first let the body up 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.149
 temperature come 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.449
 the horse is allowed to descend as much as the world top that the long bridge 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.120
 to ski 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.099
 the maximum 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.629
 only reachable 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.819
 with the box and the body language the horse corrects as I think I do 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.329
 is out of balance 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.760
 at home where making regularly passes from then on to step 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.189
 and vice versa 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.279
 During the transition we can see well on the horse remains balanced and can 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.049
 keep releasing 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.239
 the transitions also ensures that the hand is made 8 more stimulated 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.849
 and the horse must be aware of its hind legs 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.109
 so just as it were the engine on 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.069
 I go both ways and the mountains start to carry the horse more and more actively 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.810
 so that he with his hind legs what to make behind the net according to wenger 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.499
 and move the forelegs forward of the lottery as much as possible 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.439
 they stay that way 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.979
 as short as possible on the ground 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:08.040
 then the usual and substances there were also a lot about trot and canter 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.099
 and then the sum 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.739
 it is also a good exercise to keep the horse for longer 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.959
 are going to operate 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.849
 most horses are just standing there in this must be solved he 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.849
 all walks of the whole body 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.229
 if only it has been upgraded and you can vary in wins 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.759
 so you can start by asking the horse to shrink the brochure 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.629
 Hereby a question more length bending of the pair 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.250
 there is the outsides 6 that only do such a program 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.779
 the inside there must be a pair of escort and on the savings 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.079
 and you can do this short pieces and then enlarge things again 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.549
 how long and how often you do this depends on the horse 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.489
 and what you want to achieve with dosing that day 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.339
 is it just a tougher ride to get to the cup or is it one 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.869
 training in itself 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:05.569
 then you can still use the progressive if during shunting 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.799
 non-progressive transition 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.150
 a progressive already passing is for example transition of steps the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.629
 kick off or short on nothing 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.600
 in non-progressive the transition is for example from halle twenterand or from 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.340
 step I am going to walk 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.290
 so then you skip one or more intermediate corridors 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.979
 you can ask the horse to switch within each course 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.039
 so to speed up or slow down again 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.020
 Bad transitions are also very good training 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.210
 but it must also be well focused on terrorizing in this must in turn 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.449
 being there exactly is a timing 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.439
 neither are there 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.620
 in short, the couple's check is absolutely very valuable 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.620
 try to keep pace with pace 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.939
 during the transition 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.949
 use voting aids 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.999
 and possibly supporting your body language or the plan they know 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.020
 cards that you can use as an extension of yourself 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:15.969
 That is of course the necessary points in order to reduce the mail with your horse smaller and smaller 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:16.969
 to vote 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.969
 just as you want to achieve under the saddle and by the hand 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.849
 it is also very important to be consistent with officers 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.689
 the strongest self is waiting for your horse's response to a certain help 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.499
 so you always know the best of the aids that mind 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.499
 and your horse's response to this 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.060
 Staying can make a very useful contribution at the end of your horse 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.509
 I look very conceivable myself 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.120
 letter of the ice on the leg setting of your horse is this incorrect 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.159
 that is often not the animal in this correct vertical evaluation 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.050
 because he eats 8 i am you have 4 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.580
 unburden 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.960
 the inner hindleg must go to the center of gravity 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.430
 the followers must follow the same line as the outside for p 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.600
 also look at that couple moving through his body the roads horse beautiful 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.619
 representative moderate 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:14.729
 the pendulum action is guided from the rear legs 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.599
 put a few at the benefits of being just as far away from the shoulder 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.569
 office park with his head 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.590
 There are lots of points that you can judge while staying in India 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:28.069
 Provide information about how the horse is 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.960
 can use that information again during the on-hand training sessions 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.479
 Robben has Saturday 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.960
 During this video you will see some of these exercises with you and your gift 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.469
 to be carried out 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:45.539
 It is important that you learn to see and look for the horse as an individual 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.439
 after what best fits that animal 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:52.639
 so you can get the whole temperamental horses and tense and hot from it 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.839
 making many pass 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:58.249
 and if you stay out then for example use back to prepare for it 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:59.010
 to drive 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.630
 then you can sometimes choose to leave the transitions 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.809
 but that is personal for you and your horse for you as a combination 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.880
 that's what he says in this video about producing your horse on the ankle and 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:13.749
 bye 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:16.439
 I hope it will help you to see the garden
