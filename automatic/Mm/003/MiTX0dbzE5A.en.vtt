00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.300
 business customs union 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.699
 strengthened trade ties made investments

 Obviously the sum of projects speak for themselves. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.340
 yourself but something for the Russian leader 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.430

 meeting of two presidents in Yekaterinburg 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 started with a little geography lesson 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 center of Russia despite the prevailing 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 opinion this is of course not Moscow 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.079
 but not Ekaterinburg even though 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.079
 located on the border of Europe and Asia 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.739

 Nazarbayeva although held in business 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 but more like a friendly 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.950
 conversation 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.510
 it is understandable Russia and Kazakhstan 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.830

 stellar indicators top blitz when 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.580
 I want to note that trade in essence 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.060
 commodity flows to Russia from 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.800
 Kazakhstan are growing much faster 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.119
 than our put in 10 years I am again 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.210
 both countries and now more attention 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.910
 neighbors 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.370
 areas and the output is sad that 70 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.570
 percent are exactly on these 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.459
 President of the two largest states 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.840

 most effective economic 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.640
 tool on the territory of the former USSR 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.810
 the business has already appreciated what simplification means 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.470
 customs procedures 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.739
 what are the benefits of competition 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.690
 national jurisdictions now each of 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.940

 the state understands that without each other 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.790
 Today, only joint 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.620

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.600
 they work in various fields 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.970
 and the extraction of raw materials to information 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.890
 technology house independent state 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.019
 for several years managed to create something 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.820
 many do not go out for decades 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.680
 and further cooperation may 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.769
 allow to insure against the world 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.060
 economic instability sure that 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.590
 deep industrial cooperation in 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.709

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.989
 economic relations even more 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.400
 strength will balance 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.680
 effects of fluctuations in world markets 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.030
 the head of Kazakhstan today is betting 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.769
 not only on industry 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.570
 innovative technologies over which 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.340
 working in the republic with skillful 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.750
 private equity can 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.000
 bring our countries to the level 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.200
 comparable to the most technologically 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.390
 developed powers 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 such as japan or korea today 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.360
 private business in Kazakhstan in Russia 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.530
 able to support 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.060
 our modernization reforms 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.360
 governments new 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.170
 industrial and to your number 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.939
 the Russian president was today 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.730
 forced to confess financial relations 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.170
 between our countries he was surprised by russia 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.060
 considered up to today 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.189
 largest investor in the post-Soviet 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.349
 space is the position passed 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.450
 when opened one page looked 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.620
 almost a billion from the Russian side was 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.819
 invested in Kazakhstani economy 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.739
 936 billion million 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.540
 but when the rest of the next page 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.250
 It turns out from Kazakhstan to Russia about 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.599
 700 billion invested 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.400
 it was unexpected for me to be honest in 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.750
 modern world between neighbors nothing 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.970
 could not be more important than close 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.859
 cooperation and full understanding 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.780
 Nazarbayev and Putin today in the next 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.120
 this is confirmed by the two oldest 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.919
 partner and neighbor at any time ready 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.530
 support each other and at the same time 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.449
