and the only person that actually was
there<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.309> Barry<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.850> Barry<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.660> obviously

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

going<00:00:40.260> up<00:00:40.559> against<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> reverse-flash<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
going up against the reverse-flash and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
going up against the reverse-flash and
that<00:00:42.540> basically<00:00:42.750> confirms<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> one

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that basically confirms that one

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.310 
that basically confirms that one
Harrison<00:00:44.520> wells<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> bad

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
Harrison wells is not the bad

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.810 
Harrison wells is not the bad
reverse-flash<00:00:46.920> he's<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.670> that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
reverse-flash he's not the one that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
reverse-flash he's not the one that
killed<00:00:48.000> Barry's<00:00:48.300> mother<00:00:48.450> he's<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
killed Barry's mother he's just a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
killed Barry's mother he's just a
different<00:00:49.789> reverse-flash<00:00:50.789> could<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
different reverse-flash could be from a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
different reverse-flash could be from a
different<00:00:52.050> dimension<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.340> also

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
different dimension so that also

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.010 
different dimension so that also
confirms<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.480> he's<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
confirms that one he's got the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.229 
confirms that one he's got the
reverse-flash<00:00:55.289> too<00:00:56.039> he<00:00:56.520> didn't<00:00:56.820> kill<00:00:56.940> Barry's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
reverse-flash too he didn't kill Barry's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.900 
reverse-flash too he didn't kill Barry's
mother<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.989> huge<00:00:58.440> part<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.129> why<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> think

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
mother that's a huge part of why I think

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
mother that's a huge part of why I think
that<00:01:00.090> maybe<00:01:00.270> he's<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.079> evil<00:01:01.530> my<00:01:02.039> guess

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that maybe he's not really evil my guess

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.000 
that maybe he's not really evil my guess
is<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.670> he<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> reverse<00:01:04.140> flash<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is that he is a reverse flash from a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.100 
is that he is a reverse flash from a
different<00:01:05.369> time<00:01:05.400> period<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> he<00:01:06.570> changed<00:01:07.080> his

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
different time period and he changed his

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.870 
different time period and he changed his
mind<00:01:07.320> he<00:01:07.650> went<00:01:07.830> back<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.220> time<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.760> actually

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
mind he went back in time to actually

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.690 
mind he went back in time to actually
help<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> flash<00:01:10.409> become<00:01:10.860> better<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
help you know the flash become better so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
help you know the flash become better so
he<00:01:11.729> could<00:01:12.000> defeat<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> real<00:01:12.689> reverse<00:01:13.049> flash

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
he could defeat the real reverse flash

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
he could defeat the real reverse flash
who<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:13.979> probably<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.030> saw<00:01:15.060> in

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
who was probably the one that we saw in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.090 
who was probably the one that we saw in
the<00:01:15.600> mid-season<00:01:16.140> finale<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:17.009> were

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the mid-season finale because there were

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.820 
the mid-season finale because there were
two<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.670> episode<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:19.049> still<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
two in that episode and I still think it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
two in that episode and I still think it
could<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.130> Edward<00:01:20.520> Thawne<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.630> future

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
could be Edward Thawne from the future

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
could be Edward Thawne from the future
that<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> real<00:01:23.070> reverse-flash<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:23.939> my

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that is the real reverse-flash that's my

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
that is the real reverse-flash that's my
guess<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.439> I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
guess on what is going on right now I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.890 
guess on what is going on right now I
could<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.610> wrong<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> main<00:01:27.509> thing<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
could be wrong but the main thing is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.039 
could be wrong but the main thing is
that<00:01:28.439> Harrison<00:01:29.189> wells<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.670> most<00:01:30.180> likely<00:01:30.450> not

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that Harrison wells is most likely not

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.230 
that Harrison wells is most likely not
really<00:01:31.380> evil<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.950> anything<00:01:32.610> he<00:01:32.759> could<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.030> an

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
really evil if anything he could be an

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
really evil if anything he could be an
increased<00:01:33.720> fan<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> future<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.430> got

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
increased fan from the future that got

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
increased fan from the future that got
powers<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> flash<00:01:36.479> by<00:01:36.720> replicating<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
powers of the flash by replicating you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
powers of the flash by replicating you
know<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> Speed<00:01:39.210> Force<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
know how you get the Speed Force and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.050 
know how you get the Speed Force and
basically<00:01:40.470> he's<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> huge<00:01:41.430> fan<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> Barry

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
basically he's just a huge fan of Barry

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.510 
basically he's just a huge fan of Barry
and<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.420> why<00:01:42.570> he<00:01:42.720> went<00:01:42.869> back<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.259> time

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
and that's why he went back in time

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
and that's why he went back in time
during<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.759> time<00:01:45.000> his<00:01:45.180> mother<00:01:45.420> died<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
during the time his mother died to

of points to the fact that Harrison

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.050 
of points to the fact that Harrison
wells<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.960> most<00:02:07.229> likely<00:02:07.469> not<00:02:07.860> evil<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.879> that's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
wells is most likely not evil so that's

section
below<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:13.049> Harrison<00:02:13.409> wells<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
below do you think Harrison wells is a

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.160 
below do you think Harrison wells is a
bad<00:02:14.459> person<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:15.060> come<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.480> there's<00:02:15.989> two

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
bad person now come on there's two

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.899 
bad person now come on there's two
reverse<00:02:16.439> flashes<00:02:16.980> he's<00:02:17.220> obviously<00:02:17.519> not<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
reverse flashes he's obviously not the

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.910 
reverse flashes he's obviously not the
one<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.239> killed<00:02:18.420> Barry's<00:02:18.780> mother<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.379> he<00:02:19.829> has

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
one that killed Barry's mother so he has

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.699 
one that killed Barry's mother so he has
a<00:02:19.950> different<00:02:20.340> reason<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:21.209> being<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:22.290> head

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
a different reason for being the head

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.649 
a different reason for being the head
person<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.280> STAR<00:02:23.519> Labs<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:24.030> helping<00:02:24.420> Barry

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
person of STAR Labs and helping Barry

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.449 
person of STAR Labs and helping Barry
Allen<00:02:25.019> become<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> flash<00:02:25.739> there's<00:02:26.159> obviously

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
Allen become the flash there's obviously

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.339 
Allen become the flash there's obviously
a<00:02:26.519> reason<00:02:26.549> behind<00:02:26.939> that<00:02:27.209> if<00:02:27.540> he<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.140> was

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
a reason behind that if he really was

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.289 
a reason behind that if he really was
evil<00:02:28.739> he<00:02:28.829> probably<00:02:29.069> what<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> killer<00:02:29.459> by<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:29.849> so

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
evil he probably what a killer by now so

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.000 
evil he probably what a killer by now so
what<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.569> think<00:02:30.780> about<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.989> sound<00:02:31.890> off
