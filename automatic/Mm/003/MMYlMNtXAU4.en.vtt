much as four to five thousand years old

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760

so<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.540> an<00:03:20.750> ancient<00:03:20.930> water<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.620> that's

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
so it's an ancient water and that's

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.410 
so it's an ancient water and that's
another<00:03:22.040> reason<00:03:22.250> why<00:03:22.550> it's<00:03:22.730> very<00:03:22.940> clean<00:03:23.240> is

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
another reason why it's very clean is

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.870 
another reason why it's very clean is
because<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.440> hasn't<00:03:24.620> seen<00:03:24.950> any<00:03:25.130> of<00:03:25.220> mankind's

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
because it hasn't seen any of mankind's

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.520 
because it hasn't seen any of mankind's
pollutants<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:26.660> excellent<00:03:27.350> for

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
pollutants so it's excellent for
