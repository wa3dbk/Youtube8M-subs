teach you how to fill the fish tank I've

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.020 
teach you how to fill the fish tank I've
got<00:00:11.080> the<00:00:11.230> Python<00:00:11.620> on<00:00:11.740> my<00:00:11.830> hand<00:00:12.099> with<00:00:12.670> a<00:00:12.700> host

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
got the Python on my hand with a host

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.660 
got the Python on my hand with a host
pinch<00:00:13.420> so<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:13.990> water<00:00:14.200> cannot<00:00:14.620> go<00:00:14.830> out<00:00:15.040> but<00:00:15.550> the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
pinch so the water cannot go out but the

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.310 
pinch so the water cannot go out but the
water<00:00:15.880> is<00:00:16.029> slowly<00:00:16.240> creeping<00:00:16.510> out<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:16.990> this<00:00:17.140> or

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
water is slowly creeping out of this or

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.170 
water is slowly creeping out of this or
you're<00:00:17.440> going<00:00:17.680> from<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.010> kitchen<00:00:18.220> to<00:00:18.940> the<00:00:18.970> lid

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
you're going from the kitchen to the lid

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.460 
you're going from the kitchen to the lid
right<00:00:19.360> you<00:00:19.600> sort<00:00:19.869> of<00:00:19.930> trying<00:00:20.110> to<00:00:20.230> be<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.350> little

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
right you sort of trying to be a little

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.710 
right you sort of trying to be a little
fast<00:00:20.830> walking<00:00:21.279> and<00:00:21.430> doing<00:00:21.760> this<00:00:21.940> when<00:00:22.630> you're

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
fast walking and doing this when you're

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.990 
fast walking and doing this when you're
going<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:23.170> fill<00:00:23.440> the<00:00:23.560> tank<00:00:23.830> up<00:00:24.070> put<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:24.760> head

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
going to fill the tank up put the head

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.210 
going to fill the tank up put the head
of<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.210> Python<00:00:25.600> interesting<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.830> let<00:00:27.039> know

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
of the Python interesting and let know

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.279 
of the Python interesting and let know
the<00:00:27.400> hose<00:00:27.609> very<00:00:28.000> slowly<00:00:28.480> so<00:00:28.869> that<00:00:28.900> you<00:00:28.990> don't

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
the hose very slowly so that you don't

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.200 
the hose very slowly so that you don't
wash<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.830> fish<00:00:30.070> out<00:00:30.279> of<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.519> tank

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
wash the fish out of the tank

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.940 
wash the fish out of the tank
if<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.570> let<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.750> go<00:00:31.960> too<00:00:32.019> fast<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.800> can

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
if you let it go too fast you can

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.560 
if you let it go too fast you can
actually<00:00:32.980> hurt<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.640> fish<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.059> bruise<00:00:34.239> them

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
actually hurt the fish and bruise them

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.900 
actually hurt the fish and bruise them
this<00:00:35.200> process<00:00:35.800> will<00:00:35.980> kill<00:00:36.220> them<00:00:36.399> there's<00:00:36.670> also

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
this process will kill them there's also

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.209 
this process will kill them there's also
stuff<00:00:37.360> called<00:00:37.690> a<00:00:37.960> chlorine<00:00:38.500> remover<00:00:39.040> which

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
stuff called a chlorine remover which

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.490 
stuff called a chlorine remover which
this<00:00:39.399> one<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.730> an<00:00:39.850> aqua<00:00:40.149> safe<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:40.660> I<00:00:40.750> got<00:00:40.960> it

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
this one is an aqua safe that I got it

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.229 
this one is an aqua safe that I got it
removes<00:00:41.890> chlorine<00:00:42.160> out<00:00:42.520> of<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.730> water<00:00:42.969> and

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
removes chlorine out of the water and

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.150 
removes chlorine out of the water and
what<00:00:43.329> I'm<00:00:43.450> going<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.780> do<00:00:43.989> just<00:00:44.559> take<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.950> cap

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
what I'm going to do just take the cap

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.410 
what I'm going to do just take the cap
off<00:00:45.600> skirt<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.899> bunch<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.129> tank<00:00:48.430> usually

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
off skirt a bunch and the tank usually

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.600 
off skirt a bunch and the tank usually
is<00:00:49.540> one<00:00:49.780> capful<00:00:50.110> for<00:00:50.649> every<00:00:50.860> ten<00:00:51.100> gallons<00:00:51.430> of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
is one capful for every ten gallons of

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.209 
is one capful for every ten gallons of
water<00:00:51.789> so<00:00:52.210> being<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:52.930> pro<00:00:53.200> like<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:53.649> am<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:54.129> know

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
water so being a pro like I am I know

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.920 
water so being a pro like I am I know
how<00:00:54.550> much<00:00:54.670> water<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.239> I<00:00:55.270> take<00:00:55.539> out<00:00:55.719> of<00:00:55.750> the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
how much water that I take out of the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.770 
how much water that I take out of the
tank<00:00:56.200> which<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:56.980> about<00:00:57.309> 20<00:00:58.120> gallons<00:00:58.449> of<00:00:58.600> water

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
tank which is about 20 gallons of water

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.170 
tank which is about 20 gallons of water
so<00:00:59.500> I<00:00:59.530> know<00:00:59.680> in<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.219> bottle<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:00.670> had<00:01:00.850> enough

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
so I know in this bottle I had enough

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.510 
so I know in this bottle I had enough
for<00:01:01.719> 20<00:01:02.020> gallons<00:01:02.350> that<00:01:02.559> I<00:01:02.620> just<00:01:02.800> put<00:01:02.980> into<00:01:03.160> it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
for 20 gallons that I just put into it

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.849 
for 20 gallons that I just put into it
but<00:01:03.910> as<00:01:04.089> aren't<00:01:04.359> filling<00:01:04.600> its<00:01:04.839> tank<00:01:05.139> I<00:01:05.379> install

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:05.859 
but as aren't filling its tank I install

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:09.209 
but as aren't filling its tank I install
the<00:01:05.979> Python<00:01:06.189> here<00:01:06.639> into<00:01:06.999> this<00:01:07.149> tank<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.409> I<00:01:09.009> put

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:09.219 
the Python here into this tank and I put

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:10.499 
the Python here into this tank and I put
the<00:01:09.310> coin<00:01:09.520> remover<00:01:09.939> in<00:01:10.060> there<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.450> the

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
the coin remover in there and the

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.599 
the coin remover in there and the
chlorine<00:01:10.840> remover<00:01:11.170> works<00:01:11.380> instantly<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.579> you

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:12.609 
chlorine remover works instantly so you

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:15.120 
chlorine remover works instantly so you
don't<00:01:12.939> have<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.329> let<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.600> tank<00:01:13.869> sit<00:01:13.959> if<00:01:14.529> you're

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
don't have to let the tank sit if you're

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.330 
don't have to let the tank sit if you're
not<00:01:15.399> comfortable<00:01:15.939> with<00:01:16.649> putting<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.889> Python

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
not comfortable with putting the Python
