00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
properly things are gonna ferment and

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.119 
properly things are gonna ferment and
they<00:01:43.329> can<00:01:43.539> actually<00:01:44.079> come<00:01:44.409> back<00:01:44.469> up<00:01:44.829> if<00:01:45.039> you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:45.129

that's<00:01:46.329> what<00:01:46.479> can<00:01:46.659> actually<00:01:47.079> cause<00:01:47.409> the

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
that's what can actually cause the

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.619
