00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.940
 hi this is the minute is covered 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.950
 today I propose to discover 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.360
 kids 4 woe those out there are really 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.710
 very particular because they are made 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.290
 bake in the oven 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.970
 so we can see the packaging that is 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.439
 really hides red classics and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.270
 yellow except that in front and back 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.829
 wants to see a glove that goes to the oven and 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.390
 no mini short so for you 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.399
 explain that here we have to do 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.890
 broil it does absolutely not revenge 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.970
 cold so that's who capture are enough 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.260
 recent they really went out and 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.149
 a few months in japan 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.800
 so here I have my friend who sent it to me 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.630
 not so long ago that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.670
 was nice enough to test for 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.579
 you 2 here when we open we can 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.289
 find plenty of mini icap bags so 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.089
 the sky and the red 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.679
 and when we open it's really like 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.570
 one he captures clasico it's really a 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.429
 so that we can cook it 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.449
 really classic beach oven does 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.620
 not touch too much because that make 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.499
 really quickly 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.750
 so here are two bars and now we're going 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.090
 pass the test so I used my 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.640
 uniform and you can use the oven 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.470
 under the claw so classic and the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.730
 so these frozen parts set to 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.159
 between 180 degrees 180 190 degrees and that 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.590
 cooked really fast on call 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.119
 of three minutes it's really ready in 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.979
 does when it's really horrible 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.259
 chocolate starts a little bit deep in 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.299
 back it's ready so here I show you 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.909
 so I was for a name that was 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.280
 decomposed when I print them as a team 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.659
 and here's the interior is really the same 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.159
 a kit cars that we find the small 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.500
 cake the psycho fracture lover all 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.960
 they are like the top and the ultra 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.070
 ultra crispy is gratinated then 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 it's not recurrent I promise you 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.509
 really not so sweet it's 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.710
 super good go this is the avenue 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.710
