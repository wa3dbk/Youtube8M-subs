so<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> Sigma<00:00:24.180> BMC<00:00:25.080> 15-8<00:00:26.269> it's<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so this is the Sigma BMC 15-8 it's a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
so this is the Sigma BMC 15-8 it's a
legend<00:00:27.779> acoustic<00:00:28.109> bass<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:29.039> picked<00:00:29.580> this

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
legend acoustic bass and I'm picked this

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
legend acoustic bass and I'm picked this
up<00:00:29.820> last<00:00:30.390> year<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.650> didn't<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
up last year because I didn't have a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.430 
up last year because I didn't have a
double<00:00:33.030> bass<00:00:33.149> nor<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.540> play<00:00:33.690> double<00:00:33.960> bass<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
double bass nor do I play double bass so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.420 
double bass nor do I play double bass so
I<00:00:34.500> thought<00:00:34.649> I'd<00:00:34.739> better<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> compromise

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430

buying this and this just actually felt
the<00:00:41.430> best<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.910> terms<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> kind<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.510> weight<00:00:42.809> it's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the best in terms of kind of weight it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
the best in terms of kind of weight it's
really<00:00:43.530> evenly<00:00:43.710> balanced<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.450> on<00:00:45.450> top<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
really evenly balanced and on top of

really evenly balanced and on top of
that<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:46.890> sounded<00:00:47.219> great<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that it sounded great and it's a

just got a really nice kind of just
really<00:00:59.070> organic<00:00:59.550> kind<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.969> warm<00:01:00.210> tone<00:01:10.010> haven't

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
really organic kind of warm tone haven't

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.230 
really organic kind of warm tone haven't
really<00:01:11.159> had<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.400> anything<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.970> terms<00:01:12.119> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
really had to do anything in terms of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.730 
really had to do anything in terms of
the<00:01:12.330> action<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.020> know<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> harmonics

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the action you know so the harmonics

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.420 
the action you know so the harmonics
made<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.070> nice<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.400> well

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.730 

you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.300> play<00:01:18.420> coordinate<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.500> just

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you can play coordinate and it's just

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.510 
you can play coordinate and it's just
great<00:01:22.980> it's<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.370> really<00:01:23.400> nice<00:01:23.730> sounding<00:01:24.150> bass

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.700 

another<00:01:29.520> feature<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.150> look<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
another feature to look at is the it's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.680 
another feature to look at is the it's
actually<00:01:31.800> got<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> Fishman<00:01:32.400> electronics<00:01:33.330> built

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
actually got a Fishman electronics built

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.780 
actually got a Fishman electronics built
into<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.050> which<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.500> great<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.370> includes

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
into it which is great and that includes

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.440 
into it which is great and that includes
a<00:01:36.540> tuner<00:01:37.500> okay<00:01:38.070> which<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.360> useful

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
a tuner okay which is really useful

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.970 
a tuner okay which is really useful
because<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:40.170> means<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.440> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.770> chain

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
because it means that you can chain

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.980 
because it means that you can chain
offstage<00:01:41.370> and<00:01:41.730> go<00:01:42.120> on<00:01:42.210> stage<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.480> just<00:01:42.780> plug

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
offstage and go on stage and just plug

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
offstage and go on stage and just plug
it<00:01:43.140> straight<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.400> you're

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it straight in and you know what you're

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.540 
it straight in and you know what you're
expecting<00:01:45.050> it's<00:01:46.050> got<00:01:46.230> a<00:01:46.260> two<00:01:46.530> band<00:01:46.800> EQ<00:01:47.370> so

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
expecting it's got a two band EQ so

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.370 
expecting it's got a two band EQ so
you've<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.760> bass<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.120> treble<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.960> got<00:01:49.170> phase

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
you've got bass and treble has got phase

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.500 
you've got bass and treble has got phase
cancellation<00:01:49.650> as<00:01:50.070> well<00:01:50.280> there's<00:01:50.850> also<00:01:51.030> quite

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
cancellation as well there's also quite

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.719 
cancellation as well there's also quite
it's<00:01:51.780> quite<00:01:51.840> standard<00:01:52.290> battery<00:01:53.250> indicators

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it's quite standard battery indicators

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.830 
it's quite standard battery indicators
to<00:01:53.970> let<00:01:54.119> me<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.330> when<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> battery<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to let me know when the battery is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
to let me know when the battery is
running<00:01:54.960> low<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.950> quite<00:01:56.310> loud<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
running low it's quite loud and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.820 
running low it's quite loud and
unplugged<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.229> well<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
unplugged as well which was the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.400 
unplugged as well which was the
difference<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.630> that<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.840> noticed<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.350> was

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
difference and that I noticed when I was

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.350 
difference and that I noticed when I was
trying<00:02:01.619> some<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> other<00:02:01.950> bases<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:03.240> can

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
trying some of the other bases you can

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.670 
trying some of the other bases you can
actually<00:02:03.479> sit<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.440> kind<00:02:04.650> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
actually sit on you know kind of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.160 
actually sit on you know kind of
backstage<00:02:05.460> watch<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.330> ton<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> volume<00:02:06.600> down<00:02:10.760> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
backstage watch a ton of volume down and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.230 
backstage watch a ton of volume down and
I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.709> respect<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.880> actual<00:02:15.120> kind

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
I think in that respect the actual kind

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.630 
I think in that respect the actual kind
of<00:02:15.330> pickup<00:02:15.590> represents<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> acoustic<00:02:17.520> sound

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
of pickup represents the acoustic sound

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.610 
of pickup represents the acoustic sound
of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.820> bass<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:19.220> kind<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.660> truer<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:21.690> some<00:02:22.530> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
of the bass a kind of truer than some of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.600 
of the bass a kind of truer than some of
the<00:02:22.680> other<00:02:22.800> basic<00:02:22.950> sounded<00:02:23.370> when<00:02:23.459> they<00:02:23.550> were

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the other basic sounded when they were

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.940 
the other basic sounded when they were
plugged<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.840> comparison<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.500> where<00:02:25.830> they

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
plugged in in comparison to where they

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.830 
plugged in in comparison to where they
sounded<00:02:26.220> unplugged<00:02:26.670> which<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.540> think<00:02:27.570> it's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
sounded unplugged which is I think it's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.320 
sounded unplugged which is I think it's
quite<00:02:27.930> important

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:47.740 

you

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.810 

you
