00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:11.300
 friends August 28, 2015 he 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.300
 wonderful person 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.939
 go while traveling to your 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:27.779
 next from malaria 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:30.109
 7 gyoza somehow died like alexey 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.109
 cow 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:51.300
 he was an unusual man - traveled 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.630
 almost the entire globe 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 far and wide he showed you this on 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:06.020
 video you often saw him videos 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.020
 I do not know how so 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.700
 and didn't even know what to add it for 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:24.000
 I was just like thunder 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 Yakov heaven 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:40.830
 the whole joke of malaria is that often 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:45.400
 there are periods of relief from the false and 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.610
 it seems that everything is already behind then 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.340
 there is a sharp aggravation 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.740
 vital signs are falling man 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.740
 falls into a coma and never returns 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.630
 many now probably will write about what 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.950
 no traveler friends 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.120
 malaria is useless to inculcate more 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.420
 like a cold of some region she is so 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.370
 working some other way somewhere there 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.370
 immunity somewhere no immunity and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.290
 it's all the will of the case I don't know interrupted 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.410
 he did not interrupt it no longer has 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:36.310
 no value on the 23rd day he wrote 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.870
 his last post he thanked you 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:46.810
 friends for helping to support 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:50.940
 Well, I wrote that he was better after 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.940
 almost a week man was gone 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.560
 I do not know what else to add 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.020
 but 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.800
 as 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:06:00.720
 here is the culprit of all troubles that gas stove 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:04.550
 In short, I almost died I almost 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.550
 gasped we cover the eyes and 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.550
 we light 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.590
 that's how wonderful it works like this 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:27.000
 and left for the night because it was very 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:30.990
 cold she is very awake from the fact that 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.990
 probably the following happened 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.180
 it became so 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.710
 woke up somehow realized that but not 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.920
 rather did not understand just woke up 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.270
 intuition turned off really stupid 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.650
 suffocate you when you go to 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:55.470
 journey when you go technical 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.090
 travel to australia suffocate in 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.960
 gas in one of the hotels 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.960
 Pakistan
