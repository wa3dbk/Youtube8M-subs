00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
max I think we put it on the downrigger

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.230 
max I think we put it on the downrigger
clip<00:01:50.259> so<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.280> let<00:01:51.429> him<00:01:51.520> go<00:01:51.670> down<00:01:51.850> you're<00:01:52.119> gonna

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
let them go down to 60 to 80 feet once

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.940 
let them go down to 60 to 80 feet once
you<00:01:56.500> get<00:01:56.679> to<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.979> depth<00:01:58.530> stop<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.830> you're

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
you get to the depth stop and you're

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.109 
you get to the depth stop and you're
actually<00:02:00.250> controlling<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.670> boats<00:02:00.909> actually

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
actually controlling the boats actually

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.600 
actually controlling the boats actually
moving<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.380> that's<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.830> thing<00:02:03.039> so<00:02:03.159> we<00:02:03.280> got<00:02:03.429> one

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610

bait<00:02:03.819> down<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.270> downrigger<00:02:04.659> we're<00:02:04.869> gonna

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
bait down on the downrigger we're gonna

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.589 
bait down on the downrigger we're gonna
do<00:02:05.200> one<00:02:05.380> more<00:02:05.590> for<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.009> Outrigger

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599
