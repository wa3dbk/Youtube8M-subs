00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.320
 with all my brothers welcome to 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.480
 this space of spiritual growth 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.240
 where the Lord comes as medicine to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.460
 our soul to want to share 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.289
 from the word of the Lord a theme 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.860
 very important in our Christian life 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.280
 and is we could call it the prayer of 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.020
 intercession the value of praying ones 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.090
 for the others 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.520
 in such a way that I take the text of the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:43.690
 gospel of Luke in chapter 22 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:45.790
 verses 31 and 32 says well Simon Simon looks 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.400
 that satan has asked permission to 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.540
 shake you up like wheat that is 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.620
 clean but I have prayed for you to 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.129
 that your faith does not come down 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 and when you're back, you'll have to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.339
 strengthen your brothers 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.250
 call us the prayer of intercession orad 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.620
 for each other what is the value 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.860
 that why do it what is the reason 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.280
 so that you and I are called to pray 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.890
 for the other people who need it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 they are not a needy god and for 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 we achieve what we seek, we speak to him 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.060
 we talked we invoked it we cried 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.460
 many times agonizingly and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
 desperate because it seems that we do not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.410
 will listen but we pray for us and what 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.050
 we look but also tells us the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.869
 word of the Lord and today from this 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.490
 text we can understand that we are 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.520
 called now for each other 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.180
 because because Jesus did it because he 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.460
 he taught it to us because he knew that if 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.890
 one another we did not have in the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.690
 prayer we could not grow as a church 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.800
 We could not be a fraternal community 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.690
 a community of witnesses of Jesus Christ 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.510
