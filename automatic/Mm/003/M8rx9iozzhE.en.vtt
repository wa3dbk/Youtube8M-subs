00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
kind of skeleton scaffolding for plants

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.599 
kind of skeleton scaffolding for plants
to<00:00:20.189> grow<00:00:20.279> into<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.720> piece<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.590> called<00:00:22.949> for

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
to grow into this piece is called for

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
to grow into this piece is called for
slant<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.689> concept<00:00:25.019> came<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.500> was

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
slant the concept came when I was

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
slant the concept came when I was
looking<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.039> own<00:00:26.189> shelving<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:26.820> very

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
looking at my own shelving with very

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.790 
looking at my own shelving with very
vertical<00:00:27.539> walls<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> books<00:00:28.500> kept

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
vertical walls and the books kept

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.189 
vertical walls and the books kept
falling<00:00:29.099> under<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.550> weight<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.760> gravity<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
falling under the weight of gravity so I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.380 
falling under the weight of gravity so I
decided<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:33.000> them<00:00:33.180> rest

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
decided what can I do to have them rest

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
decided what can I do to have them rest
in<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.630> very<00:00:33.809> comfortable<00:00:34.110> position<00:00:34.850> I've

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
in a very comfortable position I've

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.020 
in a very comfortable position I've
designed<00:00:36.300> these<00:00:36.510> broken<00:00:37.140> mirrors<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.030> love

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
designed these broken mirrors I love

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
designed these broken mirrors I love
designing<00:00:39.480> mirrors<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.860> object

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
designing mirrors because the object

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
designing mirrors because the object
itself<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.820> mirror<00:00:42.030> glass<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.110> full<00:00:43.829> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
itself the mirror glass is so full of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.850 
itself the mirror glass is so full of
metaphor<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.090> symbolism<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:46.350> are<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
metaphor and symbolism these are kind of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.439 
metaphor and symbolism these are kind of
a<00:00:47.100> new<00:00:47.370> way<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> look<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.379> an<00:00:49.379> existing<00:00:49.950> object

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
a new way to look at an existing object

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.380 
a new way to look at an existing object
and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.170> game<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.329> wanted<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and I think that's very game I wanted to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.500 
and I think that's very game I wanted to
use<00:00:54.719> linen<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> pillows

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
use linen for the pillows

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.590 
use linen for the pillows
instead<00:00:57.469> of<00:00:57.500> using<00:00:58.070> hemp<00:00:58.579> which<00:00:59.210> is<00:00:59.359> fantastic

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
instead of using hemp which is fantastic

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.130 
instead of using hemp which is fantastic
fiber<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:01.039> grows<00:01:01.670> up<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.120> six<00:01:02.719> times<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
fiber it grows up to six times the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.990 
fiber it grows up to six times the
amount<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.559> fiber<00:01:03.739> on<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.220> same<00:01:04.430> amount<00:01:04.610> of

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
amount of fiber on the same amount of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.710 
amount of fiber on the same amount of
land<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.630> lux<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:07.580> fabric<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.420> think<00:01:08.630> is

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
land is lux and the fabric I think is

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.990 
land is lux and the fabric I think is
beautiful<00:01:08.899> it<00:01:09.470> looks<00:01:09.530> my<00:01:10.040> feels<00:01:10.310> just<00:01:10.610> like<00:01:10.670> a

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
beautiful it looks my feels just like a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.020 
beautiful it looks my feels just like a
high-quality<00:01:11.299> linen<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:13.280> is<00:01:13.430> also<00:01:13.610> machine

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
high-quality linen that is also machine

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.420 
high-quality linen that is also machine
washable<00:01:14.060> which<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:14.780> good<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.680> think<00:01:16.310> we're

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
washable which is good I think we're

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.070 
washable which is good I think we're
quite<00:01:16.520> fascinated<00:01:17.119> actually<00:01:17.450> buy<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.659> there

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
quite fascinated actually buy it there

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.230 
quite fascinated actually buy it there
comes<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.770> idea<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.159> living<00:01:19.399> architecture

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
comes the idea of living architecture

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.330 
comes the idea of living architecture
and<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:20.960> just<00:01:21.200> kind<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:21.470> creating<00:01:21.920> creating

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and it's just kind of creating creating

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.120 
and it's just kind of creating creating
a<00:01:22.610> space<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:24.020> then<00:01:24.080> kind<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.740> having<00:01:25.039> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
a space and then kind of having the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.490 
a space and then kind of having the
plants<00:01:25.549> just<00:01:26.090> take<00:01:26.330> over<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:26.930> making<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.380> into

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
plants just take over and making it into

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.639 
plants just take over and making it into
a<00:01:27.740> into<00:01:28.310> a<00:01:28.520> living<00:01:28.819> a<00:01:29.210> living<00:01:29.720> environment<00:01:30.259> it

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
a into a living a living environment it

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.050 
a into a living a living environment it
represents<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.429> both<00:01:32.330> functional<00:01:33.880> creation<00:01:34.880> as

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
represents a both functional creation as

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.419 
represents a both functional creation as
well<00:01:35.569> as<00:01:35.690> an<00:01:35.810> aesthetic<00:01:36.259> creation<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.950> I

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
well as an aesthetic creation and I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.370 
well as an aesthetic creation and I
think<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:38.060> good<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.539> have<00:01:39.100> green<00:01:40.149> ideas<00:01:41.380> but

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
think it's good to have green ideas but

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.690 
think it's good to have green ideas but
it's<00:01:42.530> better<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.860> actually<00:01:42.950> have<00:01:43.310> ideas<00:01:43.670> that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
it's better to actually have ideas that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.370 
it's better to actually have ideas that
have<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:43.970> function<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.929> reason<00:01:45.229> for

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
have a function and the reason for

00:01:45.380 --> 00:02:02.260 
have a function and the reason for
people<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.619> actually<00:01:45.799> want<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.460> buy<00:01:46.610> them

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270
