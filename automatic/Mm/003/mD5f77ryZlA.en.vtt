00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
into a much more unstressed wrist which

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280 
into a much more unstressed wrist which
means<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.520> less<00:01:47.790> wrist<00:01:48.540> strain<00:01:49.049> that's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
means you know less wrist strain that's

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.810 
means you know less wrist strain that's
always<00:01:49.560> good<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:49.860> traditional<00:01:50.610> mice

little<00:04:25.690> bit<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.020> time<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:27.100> get<00:04:27.670> used<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.480> using

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
little bit of time to get used to using

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.070 
little bit of time to get used to using
it<00:04:29.290> now<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.890> not<00:04:30.280> really<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:31.060> gaming<00:04:31.900> mouse

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
it now this is not really a gaming mouse

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.980 
it now this is not really a gaming mouse
I<00:04:32.290> mean<00:04:32.410> it's<00:04:32.560> not<00:04:32.770> intended<00:04:33.340> for<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:34.210> but

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
I mean it's not intended for that but

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.580 
I mean it's not intended for that but
still<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:36.040> is<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.430> kick-ass<00:04:37.270> product<00:04:37.840> until

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
still this is a kick-ass product until

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.370 
still this is a kick-ass product until
next<00:04:38.710> time<00:04:38.860> take<00:04:39.220> care
