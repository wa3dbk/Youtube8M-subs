00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that at the beginning of summer I tried

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.310 
that at the beginning of summer I tried
to<00:00:29.100> open<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.700> a<00:00:29.880> subscriber<00:00:30.750> world<00:00:31.020> for<00:00:31.260> you

guys to come out and play but that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.869 
guys to come out and play but that
didn't<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:33.960> work<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:34.559> primarily<00:00:34.980> because

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
didn't really work out primarily because

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.119 
didn't really work out primarily because
like<00:00:36.449> people<00:00:36.780> would<00:00:36.840> build<00:00:37.110> stuff<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.650> then

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
like people would build stuff and then

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.530 
like people would build stuff and then
the<00:00:38.220> next<00:00:38.460> time<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.670> would<00:00:38.790> open<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.300> other

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the next time I would open it up other

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.850 
the next time I would open it up other
people<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.900> come<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.440> destroy<00:00:40.830> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
people would come in and like destroy it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.710 
people would come in and like destroy it
and<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.089> ruined<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> whole

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
and it kind of just ruined the whole

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.270 
and it kind of just ruined the whole
vibe<00:00:43.080> of<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.949> of<00:00:44.010> stopped

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
vibe of it and I just kind of stopped

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100 
vibe of it and I just kind of stopped
playing<00:00:44.580> on<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.659> just<00:00:45.809> seemed

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
playing on it because it just seemed

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.439 
playing on it because it just seemed
like<00:00:46.140> people's<00:00:46.890> creations<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.699> times<00:00:47.970> and

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
like people's creations and times and

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.729 
like people's creations and times and
things<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:48.960> had<00:00:49.080> spent<00:00:49.290> time<00:00:49.500> building

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
things that they had spent time building

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.100 
things that they had spent time building
weirdest<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.000> destroyed<00:00:51.540> by<00:00:51.750> people<00:00:52.019> who

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
weirdest it then destroyed by people who

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.860

forward<00:04:18.039> to<00:04:18.099> this<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.310> really<00:04:18.729> really<00:04:18.970> want<00:04:19.120> to

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209

do<00:04:19.329> this<00:04:19.450> with<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.690> guys<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.900> think<00:04:20.289> it's<00:04:20.380> gonna

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
do this with you guys I think it's gonna

do this with you guys I think it's gonna
be<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.680> blast<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.579> think<00:04:21.849> this<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.090> going<00:04:22.330> to

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
be a blast and I think this is going to

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.730 
be a blast and I think this is going to
be<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> easiest<00:04:23.020> way<00:04:23.110> for<00:04:23.349> me<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.440> follow

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
be the easiest way for me to follow

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.080 
be the easiest way for me to follow
through<00:04:24.010> on<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.310> because<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.610> don't<00:04:24.729> have<00:04:25.000> to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
through on it because I don't have to

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.450 
through on it because I don't have to
set<00:04:25.419> a<00:04:25.450> specific<00:04:25.780> day<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:27.070> know<00:04:27.190> it'll<00:04:27.280> just
