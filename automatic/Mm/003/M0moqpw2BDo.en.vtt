00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
now what i'm doing here is paper

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.599 
now what i'm doing here is paper
clipping<00:00:27.779> two<00:00:28.050> pieces<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> paper<00:00:28.859> together<00:00:29.189> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
clipping two pieces of paper together so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820 
clipping two pieces of paper together so
i'm<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.480> use<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> pages<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
i'm going to use two of the pages and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220 
i'm going to use two of the pages and
cut<00:00:32.520> both<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> same<00:00:33.690> time<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
cut both of them out at the same time so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.709 
cut both of them out at the same time so
i'm<00:00:34.320> using<00:00:34.530> paper<00:00:34.860> clips<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:36.120> hold<00:00:36.149> them

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
i'm using paper clips to hold them

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.240 
i'm using paper clips to hold them
together<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.469> cut<00:00:37.649> evenly<00:00:40.129> now<00:00:41.129> i'm

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
together so they cut evenly now i'm

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.160 
together so they cut evenly now i'm
using<00:00:41.520> my<00:00:41.550> ruler<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> measure<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
using my ruler to measure out one and a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990 
using my ruler to measure out one and a
half<00:00:43.230> inches<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.489> tall<00:00:44.789> my

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
half inches because that's how tall my

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110 
half inches because that's how tall my
letters<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:47.309> doesn't<00:00:47.550> matter<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.090> me

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
letters are and it doesn't matter to me

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.670 
letters are and it doesn't matter to me
where<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.480> cutting<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> page<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.469> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
where I'm cutting on the page I just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.110 
where I'm cutting on the page I just
know<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> leave<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.610> camera

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
know that I want to leave that camera

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.290 
know that I want to leave that camera
intact<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.340> went<00:00:53.460> above<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.910> camera

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
intact so I just went above that camera

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.020 
intact so I just went above that camera
measured<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:55.070> one<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> half<00:00:56.309> inches<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
measured out one and a half inches and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
measured out one and a half inches and
now<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.300> drawing<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:58.079> line<00:00:58.289> straight<00:00:58.649> across

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
now I'm drawing my line straight across

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.849 
now I'm drawing my line straight across
so<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.480> guide<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.870> follow<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.649> use

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so I have a guide to follow when I use

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.810 
so I have a guide to follow when I use
my<00:01:01.890> craft<00:01:02.370> knife<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.739> using<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.369> cutting

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
my craft knife so I'm using a cutting

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.300 
my craft knife so I'm using a cutting
mat<00:01:06.090> below<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.260> will<00:01:07.320> plot<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.010> tim

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
mat below that and I will plot my tim

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.810 
mat below that and I will plot my tim
holtz<00:01:08.960> ruler<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.320> has<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> metal<00:01:10.950> edge<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.549> so

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
holtz ruler it has a metal edge on it so

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.230 
holtz ruler it has a metal edge on it so
I'll<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.600> cut<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:14.520> again<00:01:15.150> I'm

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
I'll use that to cut and again I'm

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
I'll use that to cut and again I'm
cutting<00:01:15.570> through<00:01:15.780> both<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.259> those<00:01:16.380> papers<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
cutting through both of those papers and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.090 
cutting through both of those papers and
it's<00:01:17.369> pretty<00:01:17.640> thick<00:01:18.000> cardstock<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.020> takes<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it's pretty thick cardstock so takes a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:31.630 
it's pretty thick cardstock so takes a
few<00:01:20.400> times<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.970> go<00:01:21.090> through

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.899 

and<00:01:32.840> now<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.200> my<00:01:34.439> scissors<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.280> cut<00:01:35.729> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and now I will use my scissors to cut it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.249 
and now I will use my scissors to cut it
from<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.479> binding<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:41.659> just<00:01:42.659> even<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> up

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
from the binding and just even it up

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
from the binding and just even it up
there<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> will<00:01:44.880> erase<00:01:45.299> any<00:01:45.570> pencil

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
there and then I will erase any pencil

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:57.649 
there and then I will erase any pencil
lines<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.679> are<00:01:46.799> still<00:01:47.070> showing

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.099

doing<00:02:16.319> here<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:16.950> gluing<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.640> down<00:02:18.110> trying

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
doing here I'm gluing that down trying

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.140 
doing here I'm gluing that down trying
to<00:02:19.230> keep<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.530> even<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.010> only<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.549> wording<00:02:21.000> is

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
to keep it even so only the wording is

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.210 
to keep it even so only the wording is
showing<00:02:21.480> not<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.930> borders<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.560> put<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:22.950> it

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
showing not the borders that I put on it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.250 
showing not the borders that I put on it
those<00:02:23.879> borders<00:02:24.330> were<00:02:24.510> strictly<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
those borders were strictly so it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.479 
those borders were strictly so it
adhered<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:26.690> pages<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.010> I'm<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:32.280> lining

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
adhered to the pages so I'm just lining

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.500 
adhered to the pages so I'm just lining
that<00:02:32.790> up<00:02:32.930> making<00:02:33.930> sure<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.349> again<00:02:34.829> my<00:02:35.510> border

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
that up making sure that again my border

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.690 
that up making sure that again my border
that<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.750> added<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.620> top<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.129> bottom<00:02:38.250> do

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
that I added on to the top and bottom do

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.690 
that I added on to the top and bottom do
not<00:02:38.879> show<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.599> then<00:02:40.500> I'm<00:02:40.680> gluing<00:02:40.950> down<00:02:41.099> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
not show and then I'm gluing down the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.380 
not show and then I'm gluing down the
rest<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.209> page<00:02:43.549> just<00:02:44.549> lining<00:02:44.790> up<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
rest of the page just lining up the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.660 
rest of the page just lining up the
first<00:02:46.110> page<00:02:46.349> with<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> second<00:02:47.129> page<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.549> way

first page with the second page that way

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.530 
first page with the second page that way
I<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:47.819> it's<00:02:48.120> even<00:02:49.910> now<00:02:50.910> here<00:02:51.150> I'm<00:02:51.239> deciding

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
I know it's even now here I'm deciding

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
Swapp along with this so here I just

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.800 
Swapp along with this so here I just
wanted<00:03:48.269> two<00:03:49.019> thin<00:03:49.410> pieces<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:51.030> paper<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.690> go

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
wanted two thin pieces of paper to go

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.770 
wanted two thin pieces of paper to go
across<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:53.160> top<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.579> bottom<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.329> that<00:03:54.540> word

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
across the top and bottom of that word

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.759 
across the top and bottom of that word
inspire<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.840> didn't<00:04:01.200> measure<00:04:01.319> that<00:04:01.560> out<00:04:01.739> I

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
inspire so I didn't measure that out I

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.530 
inspire so I didn't measure that out I
just<00:04:02.099> took<00:04:02.220> two<00:04:02.459> thin<00:04:02.700> pieces<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:03.299> matched

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
just took two thin pieces that matched

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.949 
just took two thin pieces that matched
and<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:05.519> will<00:04:05.699> use<00:04:05.850> my<00:04:05.880> Scotch<00:04:06.329> quick<00:04:06.630> dry<00:04:06.900> to

and I will use my Scotch quick dry to
adhere<00:04:07.799> those<00:04:07.979> on<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.539> that<00:04:09.539> just<00:04:09.780> defines

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
adhere those on and that just defines

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.559 
adhere those on and that just defines
the<00:04:10.440> word<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.739> little<00:04:11.009> bit<00:04:11.160> better

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
the word a little bit better

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.039 
the word a little bit better
sure<00:04:12.879> brings<00:04:13.879> a<00:04:14.150> little<00:04:14.299> more<00:04:14.540> color<00:04:14.749> to<00:04:14.870> the
