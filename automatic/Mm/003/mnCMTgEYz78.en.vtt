00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.110
 hi friends from youtube after a lot 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.710
 time I return to make videos and do 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.230
 tutorials especially and to be able 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.779
 help them a little on different topics and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 what they need at this time I 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.850
 to make a video on how to make 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 the files of our computer 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.230
 appear in with their respective extension 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.170
 for example this file from from 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 notes should appear txt point if it is a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 word should appear point 2 no etcetera 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.240
 or docs with with x to do this let's 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.990
 go to start 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.300
 control Panel 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.960
 and when they load our control panel 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.880
 let's go to the option called 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.880
 Appearance and customization 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 inside this folder inside is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.330
 rather, within this menu we have 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.130
 the folder options option we click 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.490
 here 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.500
 and we are going to open a window 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.290
 property panel where we are going to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 check the tab to see 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.210
 and then we will look inside 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 of the last the option that says 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 hide file extensions for 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 known file types we are going to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 remove the check to this box and go 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.710
 to apply and subsequently to accept 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.840
 ready we close here and as you see now 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.920
 appears with the extension and if I want 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.610
 change its name 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.290
 will continue with its respective extension 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.649
 this works for any file by 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.500
 example we enter a pdf file is 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.200
 with its respective pdf extension this is 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.159
 very useful at the time of for example if 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.710
 you want to change format quickly or 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.340
 to know without without seeing what file is 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.549
 new 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.750
 they still do not need the symbol this 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.200
 option 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.379
 as I tell you, it's something a little bit that 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.760
 it is used a lot but for the moment 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.220
 I teach because there are many people who 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.980
 question like that if not I did not know I decided 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.489
 make a video like as clarifying 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.970
 Any doubt no and if we want to remove 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.459
 we do the same process to you as 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.860
 we had done before but now we put 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.019
 check in the box that we have removed 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.510
 we put back check we apply and 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.890
 we accept and ready we will have it again 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.019
 the files without extension and ready 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.980
 friends this has been all for the video of 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.590
 today I hope to continue with more videos that 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.870
 I want to go back and do many more 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.209
 tutorials and so on I hope you like it 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.250
 and as I always tell you comment score 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.220
 leave suggestions questions that already 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.600
 I will attend with pleasure and until next time 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.600
 good good good good 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.520
 if not 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.940
 but not
