00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.250
 video 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.509
 get home and sink into a gentle 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.460
 armchair is a great reward 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.460
 after a stressful day of work 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.369
 a club chair with soft leather or 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.439
 irresistibly comfortable microfiber is 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.059
 a perfect choice to relax 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.059
 read or take a nap 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.079
 the armchairs are the basic furniture in 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.149
 any house in the rest of the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.699
 day by day so it has to be very 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.120
 comfortable as well as beautiful and striking for 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.120
 the view 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.740
 The leather armchairs fit very well in 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.350
 different environments but especially 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.890
 in which we want to give a modern look 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 to our decoration 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.610
 the cleaning of sofas and armchairs 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.790
 skin is quite complicated much more 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.160
 that cloth ones for example should never 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
 used solvents is also not 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.540
 recommended that leather armchairs 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.860
 directly receive sunlight or 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.860
 any other heat source 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.410
 when choosing fabrics and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.630
 Tapestries we have to take into account 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.430
 the color to combine it with the rest of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.420
 textiles of the stay and with 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.420
 colors of the walls 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.330
 in this sense it is good to opt for tones 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.280
 timeless and give them a touch of 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.280
 distinction through the cushions 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.040
 a rattan armchair on the dining table 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.640
 It can be a modern comfortable option and 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.640
 economic 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.340
 the wingchair is known for its 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.159
 classic look and combines with the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.260
 most decorative styles 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.620
 It is also very comfortable to sleep 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.620
 a nap 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.230
 regardless of the type of armchair 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.120
 that you finally choose you should have in 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.690
 account that in addition to combining with the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.240
 This decoration should be comfortable to meet 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.220
 with its function and the most important thing that 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.220

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.360
