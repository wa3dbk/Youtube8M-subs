I'm<00:00:40.510> just<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.899> beginner<00:00:41.020> and<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.899> attempted<00:00:43.899> to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
I'm just a beginner and I attempted to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.240 
I'm just a beginner and I attempted to
make<00:00:44.199> my<00:00:44.350> very<00:00:44.590> first<00:00:44.860> bowl<00:00:45.160> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:47.110> don't<00:00:48.100> know

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
make my very first bowl and I don't know

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.290 
make my very first bowl and I don't know
if<00:00:48.340> you<00:00:48.430> can<00:00:48.610> see<00:00:48.879> but<00:00:49.149> I<00:00:50.489> believe<00:00:51.489> I<00:00:51.850> was<00:00:52.030> going

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
if you can see but I believe I was going

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.439 
if you can see but I believe I was going
with<00:00:53.020> my<00:00:53.260> gouge<00:00:53.590> at<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.399> wrong<00:00:54.609> angle<00:00:54.910> and

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
with my gouge at the wrong angle and

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.119 
with my gouge at the wrong angle and
probably<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.140> wrong<00:00:56.379> direction

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
probably in the wrong direction

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.479 
probably in the wrong direction
I<00:00:57.309> had<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.120> catch<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.559> ball<00:00:59.769> came<00:01:00.010> off<00:01:00.070> the

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
I had a catch the ball came off the

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.869 
I had a catch the ball came off the
lathe<00:01:00.699> flapped<00:01:01.449> around<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.960> shop<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.879> pretty

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
lathe flapped around the shop and pretty

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.670 
lathe flapped around the shop and pretty
much<00:01:03.969> broke<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.480> tenon<00:01:04.870> for<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.620> Chuck<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
much broke the tenon for the Chuck so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.170 
much broke the tenon for the Chuck so
looked<00:01:08.680> at<00:01:08.830> some<00:01:09.009> more<00:01:09.100> YouTube<00:01:09.490> videos<00:01:09.909> and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
looked at some more YouTube videos and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.499 
looked at some more YouTube videos and
discovered<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.720> could<00:01:10.780> make<00:01:11.049> a<00:01:11.080> face<00:01:11.350> plate

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
discovered I could make a face plate

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.630 
discovered I could make a face plate
tapped<00:01:13.509> it<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.990> I'm<00:01:14.830> going<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.100> round<00:01:15.400> it<00:01:15.580> to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
tapped it and I'm going to round it to

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.380 
tapped it and I'm going to round it to
the<00:01:17.040> inside<00:01:18.720> profile<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.110> bowl<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:22.060> I

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
the inside profile of the bowl so that I

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.890 
the inside profile of the bowl so that I
believe<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:23.049> is<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> jamb<00:01:23.560> Chuck<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.659> we're

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
believe it is a jamb Chuck so we're

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.450 
believe it is a jamb Chuck so we're
going<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.049> try<00:01:26.350> just<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.740> round<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:27.159> corner

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
going to try just to round this corner

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:43.090 
going to try just to round this corner
just<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.970> bit<00:01:30.659> okay<00:01:31.659> let's<00:01:31.900> see<00:01:32.079> how<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.290> fits

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.990 

that<00:01:44.100> feels<00:01:44.430> pretty<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.480> course<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:47.000> don't

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that feels pretty good of course I don't

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.110 
that feels pretty good of course I don't
have<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.240> whole<00:01:48.450> lot<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:49.430> experience<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.970> this

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
have a whole lot of experience with this

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.520 
have a whole lot of experience with this
so<00:01:51.300> I'm<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.570> try<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.870> bring<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.170> tail

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so I'm going to try and bring up my tail

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.420 
so I'm going to try and bring up my tail
stock<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> still<00:01:53.370> have<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> center<00:01:55.430> from

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
stock I still have the center from

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.230 
stock I still have the center from
before

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
before

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.750 
before
we'll<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.960> how<00:01:58.200> true<00:01:59.060> it<00:02:00.060> ended<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:04.550> there<00:02:05.550> it

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
we'll see how true it ended up there it

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.540 
we'll see how true it ended up there it
is<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:12.120> looks<00:02:12.480> pretty<00:02:12.840> good

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
is that looks pretty good

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.949 
is that looks pretty good
of<00:02:14.550> course<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.910> inside<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> bowl<00:02:15.720> is

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
of course the inside of the bowl is

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.680 
of course the inside of the bowl is
pretty<00:02:16.260> rough<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:17.010> never<00:02:17.850> did<00:02:18.060> get<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.209> chance<00:02:18.510> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
pretty rough I never did get a chance to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.920 
pretty rough I never did get a chance to
finish<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.590> might<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.950> throwing

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
finish it so that might be throwing

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.150 
finish it so that might be throwing
throwing<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.200> off<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> little<00:02:22.709> bit<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.070> I'm

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
throwing this off a little bit but I'm

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.770 
throwing this off a little bit but I'm
going<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> try<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.910> what<00:02:24.270> I'm<00:02:24.390> going<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.540> try

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
going to try that what I'm going to try

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.180 
going to try that what I'm going to try
to<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.230> cut<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> new<00:02:25.739> tenon<00:02:26.390> for<00:02:27.390> my<00:02:31.190> scroll

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
to do is cut a new tenon for my scroll

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.390 
to do is cut a new tenon for my scroll
check<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:35.580> then<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.480> hopefully<00:02:37.400> finish

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
check and then I can hopefully finish

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.020 
check and then I can hopefully finish
the<00:02:38.640> bowl<00:02:38.820> without<00:02:39.180> further<00:02:39.510> mishap

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
alright so I've changed the speed I'm

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.310 
alright so I've changed the speed I'm
going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.100> try<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.549> take<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.690> old<00:02:45.930> tin<00:02:46.170> and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
and now I'm back to where I was when I

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.960 
and now I'm back to where I was when I
destroyed<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:34.980> well<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.190> didn't<00:03:36.610> film<00:03:36.850> the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
turning of the inside because you all

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.130 
turning of the inside because you all
are<00:03:39.310> better<00:03:39.790> Turner's<00:03:40.240> than<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.570> am<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:40.990> my

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
are better Turner's than I am this is my

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.730 
are better Turner's than I am this is my

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
thickness through here I hit it with a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.670 
thickness through here I hit it with a
little<00:03:48.490> bit<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.880> 150<00:03:49.600> sandpaper<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.260> still<00:03:50.530> see

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
little bit of 150 sandpaper I still see

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.960 
little bit of 150 sandpaper I still see
some<00:03:50.710> tool<00:03:51.070> marks<00:03:51.400> I'm<00:03:51.550> going<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.760> have<00:03:51.850> to

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
some tool marks I'm going to have to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.100 
some tool marks I'm going to have to
sand<00:03:52.270> out<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:54.220> didn't<00:03:54.910> get<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> couple<00:03:55.720> places<00:03:55.870> I

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
sand out I didn't get a couple places I

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.699 
sand out I didn't get a couple places I
got<00:03:56.290> some<00:03:56.470> chatter<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:58.330> didn't<00:03:59.110> get<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.230> good<00:03:59.440> cut

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
got some chatter I didn't get a good cut

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.890 
got some chatter I didn't get a good cut
I<00:03:59.890> think<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:01.030> need<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.510> learn<00:04:01.630> how<00:04:01.690> to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
I think I just need to learn how to

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.650 
I think I just need to learn how to
sharpen<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.410> tool<00:04:02.560> it's<00:04:02.709> better<00:04:02.950> but<00:04:03.660> anyway

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
sharpen the tool it's better but anyway

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.840 
sharpen the tool it's better but anyway
