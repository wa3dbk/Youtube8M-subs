00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.149 
to start at your roots when you're doing
here<00:02:42.359> bottom<00:02:43.290> layers<00:02:43.530> because<00:02:43.829> they<00:02:43.980> don't

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
here bottom layers because they don't

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.500 
here bottom layers because they don't
show<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.879> just<00:02:45.030> makes<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.299> hair<00:02:45.480> look

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
show and it just makes your hair look

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.960 
show and it just makes your hair look
shorter<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.620> you're<00:02:46.769> just<00:02:46.889> going<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.220> start<00:02:47.669> at

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
shorter so you're just going to start at

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
like a little higher than the center go

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.610 
like a little higher than the center go
down<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.579> down<00:02:53.790> while<00:02:54.090> you're<00:02:54.209> doing<00:02:54.329> it
