a couple things from their games I use
this<00:00:55.230> term<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.149> experimental

place<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.289> would<00:00:58.379> be

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
place because I I think it would be

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.689 
place because I I think it would be
really<00:00:58.680> cool<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> person<00:00:59.460> where<00:00:59.579> it's
