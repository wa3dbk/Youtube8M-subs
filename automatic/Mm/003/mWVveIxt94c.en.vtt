from the moment I first saw the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.070 
from the moment I first saw the
instrument<00:00:18.060> they<00:00:18.180> seemed<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.540> be<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.720> lot<00:00:19.050> of

instrument they seemed to be a lot of
mysteries<00:00:19.590> around<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.640> finally

different patterns you found in the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.859 
different patterns you found in the
Israel<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:25.110> instrument<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.740> found<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.900> 1917

Utley<00:00:30.869> will<00:00:31.410> find<00:00:31.680> that<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> instrument<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
Utley will find that this instrument is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.200 
Utley will find that this instrument is
in<00:00:32.970> an<00:00:33.330> extremely<00:00:33.870> good<00:00:34.199> condition<00:00:35.150> how<00:00:36.150> the

in an extremely good condition how the

in an extremely good condition how the
reason<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.100> probably

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
reason for that is that it was probably

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.110 
reason for that is that it was probably

four centimeters long we don't exactly
know<00:01:22.710> why<00:01:23.010> I<00:01:23.490> suppose<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.510> for<00:01:24.689> instance<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
know why I suppose it's for instance so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.770 
know why I suppose it's for instance so
large<00:01:26.340> especially<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.240> by<00:01:27.510> all<00:01:27.689> accounts

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
large especially that by all accounts

large especially that by all accounts
people<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.340> tall<00:01:29.580> in<00:01:29.790> those<00:01:29.939> days<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
people are not so tall in those days I

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.260 
people are not so tall in those days I
wonder<00:01:32.070> how<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.340> managed<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.880> around<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
wonder how they managed to get around a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.469 
wonder how they managed to get around a
tree<00:01:34.159> after<00:01:35.159> taking<00:01:35.820> possession<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
tree after taking possession of the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.620 
tree after taking possession of the
instrument<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.770> been<00:01:37.950> very<00:01:38.250> intrigued<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
instrument I have been very intrigued to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.080 
instrument I have been very intrigued to
see<00:01:40.170> where<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.710> has<00:01:40.920> been<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.460> its<00:01:41.580> life<00:01:41.850> in

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
see where it has been when its life in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.010 
see where it has been when its life in
them<00:01:43.280> they<00:01:44.280> seem<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> real<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.390> about<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
them they seem to be a real or about the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.080 
them they seem to be a real or about the
same

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
same

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.880 
same
because<00:01:47.450> it's<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.140> largest<00:01:48.439> one<00:01:48.679> I've<00:01:48.829> ever

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
because it's the largest one I've ever

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.969 
because it's the largest one I've ever
seen<00:01:49.579> eldest<00:01:50.299> illiteracy<00:01:50.770> probably<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.829> most

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
seen eldest illiteracy probably the most

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.459 
seen eldest illiteracy probably the most
beautiful<00:01:52.429> one<00:01:52.579> as<00:01:52.700> well<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:54.170> there's

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
beautiful one as well but there's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.940 
beautiful one as well but there's
something<00:01:54.829> about<00:01:54.920> its<00:01:55.219> sound<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:56.149> just<00:01:56.950> cuts

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
something about its sound that just cuts

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649 
something about its sound that just cuts
through<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.670> orchestra<00:01:59.060> suppose<00:01:59.479> the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
through the orchestra suppose the

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.340 
through the orchestra suppose the
orchestra<00:01:59.960> makes<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.350> whole<00:02:00.530> stage<00:02:00.979> robbery

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
orchestra makes the whole stage robbery

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.590 
orchestra makes the whole stage robbery
and<00:02:02.830> my<00:02:03.490> colleague<00:02:03.790> seems<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.210> miss<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.510> even

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
and my colleague seems to miss it even

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:15.390 
and my colleague seems to miss it even
more<00:02:04.900> than<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.229> do<00:02:05.610> when<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:06.760> not<00:02:07.000> on<00:02:07.270> stage<00:02:14.400> so

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
more than I do when it's not on stage so

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.590 
more than I do when it's not on stage so
