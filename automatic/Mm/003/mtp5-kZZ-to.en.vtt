really cool the first thing you want to
do<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.689> choose<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> popular<00:00:22.890> server<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.430> either

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
do is choose a popular server so either

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.880 
do is choose a popular server so either
the<00:00:23.910> USA<00:00:24.420> servers<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> Europe<00:00:25.590> server

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the USA servers or the Europe server

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
the USA servers or the Europe server
because<00:00:26.609> they<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> highest

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
because they will have the highest

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.140 
because they will have the highest
amount<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> little<00:00:28.980> cells<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.609> collect

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
amount of little cells they can collect

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
amount of little cells they can collect
and<00:00:30.330> get<00:00:30.510> bigger<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> first<00:00:31.830> thing<00:00:32.009> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and get bigger so the first thing you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.299 
and get bigger so the first thing you
need<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.759> find<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> good<00:00:33.690> spot<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.620> where

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
need to do is find a good spot and where

need to do is find a good spot and where
there<00:00:35.520> loads<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.030> little<00:00:36.300> cells<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:37.050> one

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
there loads of little cells in one

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
there loads of little cells in one
specific<00:00:37.530> place<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.250> make<00:00:38.460> sure<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.030> there

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.930 
specific place and make sure that there
are<00:00:39.390> no<00:00:39.570> massive<00:00:40.050> players<00:00:40.500> around<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.700> can

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
are no massive players around so you can

are no massive players around so you can
collect<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.600> tiny<00:00:42.840> cells<00:00:43.140> peacefully<00:00:43.770> once

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
collect the tiny cells peacefully once

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.540 
collect the tiny cells peacefully once
you<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.700> gathered<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.710> 100<00:00:46.710> cells<00:00:47.039> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you have gathered about 100 cells you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
you have gathered about 100 cells you
are<00:00:47.579> ready<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.059> hunt<00:00:48.450> down<00:00:48.600> smaller<00:00:49.020> players

chasing because like that's easier and
instead<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.590> running<00:00:59.129> away<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.399> can

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
instead of them running away you can

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.750 
instead of them running away you can
just<00:00:59.879> shoot<00:01:00.090> yourself<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.039> catch<00:01:02.039> them<00:01:02.309> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

sweep<00:01:04.589> don't<00:01:05.430> forget<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.299> player

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
sweep don't forget that the player

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.750 
sweep don't forget that the player
you're<00:01:06.810> chasing<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.409> mass<00:01:07.680> must<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.100> smaller

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you're chasing as mass must be smaller

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.000 
you're chasing as mass must be smaller
than<00:01:09.030> half<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.570> mass<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.770> otherwise

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
than half your mass because otherwise

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000 
than half your mass because otherwise
you<00:01:11.400> may<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.880> person<00:01:12.330> getting<00:01:12.540> eaten<00:01:13.010> also

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you may be the person getting eaten also

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.230 
you may be the person getting eaten also
I<00:01:14.040> need<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> mention<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.290> because<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:18.090> are

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I need to mention that because you are

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.230 
I need to mention that because you are
bigger<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:19.320> longer<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> will<00:01:20.250> take<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.850> your

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
bigger then longer it will take for your

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.450 
bigger then longer it will take for your
split<00:01:21.750> cells<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.229> join<00:01:22.409> back<00:01:22.650> together<00:01:22.860> again

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
split cells to join back together again

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.230 
split cells to join back together again
so<00:01:24.180> keep<00:01:24.479> using<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.920> technique<00:01:26.490> once<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so keep using this technique once you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
so keep using this technique once you
have<00:01:27.390> reached<00:01:27.659> about<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.380> thousand<00:01:29.280> cells<00:01:29.579> flat

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
have reached about a thousand cells flat

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.569 
have reached about a thousand cells flat
points<00:01:30.540> whatever<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> may<00:01:31.140> call<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
points whatever you may call it then you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
points whatever you may call it then you
are<00:01:32.610> ready<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.150> start<00:01:33.390> hunting<00:01:33.869> down<00:01:34.079> groups

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
are ready to start hunting down groups

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.030 
are ready to start hunting down groups
of<00:01:35.400> smaller<00:01:35.729> players<00:01:36.030> oh<00:01:36.299> top<00:01:36.869> tip<00:01:37.140> stay<00:01:37.860> away

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
of smaller players oh top tip stay away

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.859 
of smaller players oh top tip stay away
from<00:01:38.100> corners<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> map<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.689> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
from corners of the map because if you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
from corners of the map because if you
get<00:01:40.049> cornered<00:01:40.380> by<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> player<00:01:41.040> bigger<00:01:41.340> than<00:01:41.579> you

don't know see a miracle happen or
something<00:01:48.000> every<00:01:48.840> time<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.259> use<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.799> method

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
something every time I use this method

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.929 
something every time I use this method
the<00:01:51.180> technique<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.290> worked<00:01:52.530> perfectly<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the technique it worked perfectly and I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.539 
the technique it worked perfectly and I
ended<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.350> top<00:01:55.619> 10<00:01:56.070> players

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
ended up on the top 10 players
