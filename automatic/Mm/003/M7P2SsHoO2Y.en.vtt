whole lot but it's really clear and it's
just<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.360> true<00:01:12.689> representation<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:14.689> my<00:01:15.689> voice

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
so so I'm going to talk about the mic

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
so so I'm going to talk about the mic
real<00:01:18.720> quick<00:01:20.210> let's<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:22.070> I'll<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> close-up

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
real quick let's see I'll do a close-up

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.539 
real quick let's see I'll do a close-up
on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> mic<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> large<00:01:25.170> diaphragm<00:01:25.650> super

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
on the mic it is a large diaphragm super

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.510 
on the mic it is a large diaphragm super
cardioid<00:01:26.939> condenser<00:01:27.470> microphone<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:29.250> made

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
cardioid condenser microphone it's made

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.870 
cardioid condenser microphone it's made
in<00:01:29.670> America<00:01:29.960> engineered<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.079> America<00:01:31.880> it's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
in America engineered in America it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.660 
in America engineered in America it's
super<00:01:33.360> heavy-duty<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.170> thing<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.500> awesome

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.020 

let's<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.060> oh<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> high-pass<00:01:41.610> filter

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
let's see oh it's got a high-pass filter

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.010 
let's see oh it's got a high-pass filter
on<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> front<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.619> also<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:45.020> negative

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
on the front it's also got the negative

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.469 
on the front it's also got the negative
10<00:01:46.290> DB<00:01:46.799> pad<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.909> hit<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.090> button

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.840 

I'll<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> close-up<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.979> frequency

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I'll get a close-up of the frequency

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.440 
I'll get a close-up of the frequency
response<00:01:54.600> chart<00:01:55.969> for<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.149> it's<00:01:58.759> 40<00:01:59.759> Hertz<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
response chart for you it's 40 Hertz to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.590 
response chart for you it's 40 Hertz to
18<00:02:00.990> K<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.610> pretty<00:02:02.790> good<00:02:02.969> range<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
18 K so that's a pretty good range and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.700 
18 K so that's a pretty good range and
then<00:02:04.560> I'll<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.509> angle<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:07.049> singing<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
then I'll get the angle for singing of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
then I'll get the angle for singing of
the<00:02:08.069> microphone<00:02:08.520> I'll<00:02:08.729> get<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> close-up<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the microphone I'll get a close-up of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.580 
the microphone I'll get a close-up of
that<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> look<00:02:10.200> at<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.440> as

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that so you can take a look at that as

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
that so you can take a look at that as
well

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
well

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.190 
well
and<00:02:13.140> also<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.280> comes<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.760> cool<00:02:15.060> box<00:02:15.360> it's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and also it comes in this cool box it's
