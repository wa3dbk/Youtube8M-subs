00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
through the first loop then we're going

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520 
through the first loop then we're going
to<00:02:12.330> yarn<00:02:12.569> over

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to yarn over

like so yarn over draw through two yarn

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.050 
like so yarn over draw through two yarn
over<00:02:24.300> draw<00:02:24.950> through<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.220> alright<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:26.940> we'll

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
over draw through two alright so we'll

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.700

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
let's do that again insert yarn over and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.480 
let's do that again insert yarn over and
draw<00:04:42.180> through<00:04:43.009> then<00:04:44.009> we'll<00:04:44.129> bring<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.400> yarn

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
draw through then we'll bring the yarn

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.260 
draw through then we'll bring the yarn
in<00:04:44.729> front<00:04:44.960> insert<00:04:46.370> yarn<00:04:47.370> over<00:04:47.909> and<00:04:47.940> draw

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
in front insert yarn over and draw

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.320 
in front insert yarn over and draw
through<00:04:49.490> all<00:04:50.490> right<00:04:50.759> so<00:04:50.970> we'll<00:04:51.150> continue

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
through all right so we'll continue

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.480 
through all right so we'll continue
repeating<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.259> simple<00:04:52.620> stitch<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.159> the<00:04:53.460> purl

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
repeating the simple stitch and the purl

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.839 
repeating the simple stitch and the purl
stitch<00:04:53.909> all<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.840> way<00:04:54.960> across<00:04:55.229> until<00:04:56.009> the<00:04:56.610> end

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
stitch all the way across until the end

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.740 
stitch all the way across until the end
of<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.449> forward<00:04:57.810> pass<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:59.729> now<00:05:00.389> that<00:05:00.599> we've

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
of the forward pass and now that we've

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.950 
of the forward pass and now that we've
finished<00:05:01.080> our<00:05:02.030> forward<00:05:03.030> pass<00:05:03.240> we'll<00:05:03.569> do<00:05:03.810> our

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
finished our forward pass we'll do our

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.110 
finished our forward pass we'll do our
return<00:05:04.319> pass<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.979> like<00:05:05.130> normal<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:05.789> yarn

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
return pass just like normal so yarn

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.909 
return pass just like normal so yarn
over<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.360> draw<00:05:06.509> through<00:05:06.630> one<00:05:07.110> then<00:05:07.440> yarn<00:05:07.710> over

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
over and draw through one then yarn over

and<00:05:07.949> draw<00:05:08.190> through<00:05:08.430> two<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.389> we'll<00:05:10.380> keep<00:05:11.030> yarn

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
and draw through two and we'll keep yarn

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.450 
and draw through two and we'll keep yarn
over<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.630> drawing<00:05:13.169> through<00:05:13.380> two<00:05:13.650> all<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.009> way

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
until the end of the row so we're going

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.180 
until the end of the row so we're going
to<00:05:19.740> repeat<00:05:20.659> rows<00:05:21.659> 2<00:05:22.139> &amp;<00:05:22.710> 3<00:05:24.560> until<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:25.979> reach

to repeat rows 2 &amp; 3 until you reach

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.180 
to repeat rows 2 &amp; 3 until you reach
your<00:05:26.219> desired<00:05:26.969> length<00:05:27.629> remember<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:28.949> do

your desired length remember that you do

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.230 
your desired length remember that you do
the<00:05:29.960> forward<00:05:30.960> pass<00:05:31.169> and<00:05:31.409> the<00:05:31.650> return<00:05:31.979> pass<00:05:32.240> for

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
the forward pass and the return pass for

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.570 
the forward pass and the return pass for
each<00:05:33.449> row<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.530> completes<00:05:34.949> the<00:05:35.039> row<00:05:35.280> and

yarn over and we'll draw the loop that

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.409 
yarn over and we'll draw the loop that
we're<00:06:25.560> pulling<00:06:25.770> through<00:06:26.219> through<00:06:26.909> the<00:06:26.940> loop

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
we're pulling through through the loop

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.170 
we're pulling through through the loop
on<00:06:27.630> our<00:06:27.690> hook<00:06:28.400> alright<00:06:29.400> get<00:06:29.669> the<00:06:29.789> hang<00:06:29.940> of<00:06:30.029> this

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
on our hook alright get the hang of this

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.350 
on our hook alright get the hang of this
so<00:06:30.479> purl<00:06:31.319> stitch<00:06:31.759> just<00:06:32.759> like<00:06:32.909> we<00:06:33.029> were<00:06:33.150> kind<00:06:33.330> of

so purl stitch just like we were kind of

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.920 
so purl stitch just like we were kind of
doing<00:06:33.630> before<00:06:34.909> it<00:06:35.909> but<00:06:36.210> we'll<00:06:36.360> draw<00:06:36.599> that<00:06:36.779> all

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
doing before it but we'll draw that all

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.230 
doing before it but we'll draw that all
the<00:06:37.259> way<00:06:37.380> through<00:06:37.969> the<00:06:38.969> stitch<00:06:39.240> on<00:06:39.419> our

the way through the stitch on our
simple<00:06:41.240> stitch<00:06:44.169> same<00:06:45.169> way<00:06:45.409> and<00:06:46.360> we'll<00:06:47.360> just

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
simple stitch same way and we'll just

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.860 
simple stitch same way and we'll just
continue<00:06:47.690> this<00:06:48.460> all<00:06:49.460> the<00:06:50.060> way<00:06:50.150> across<00:06:50.449> until

the end of the row it's going to create

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.200 
the end of the row it's going to create
a<00:06:53.240> nice<00:06:53.690> little<00:06:53.930> bind<00:06:54.379> off<00:06:54.620> edge<00:06:54.830> on<00:06:55.729> the<00:06:56.180> top
