00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.540
 Your game situation and question: why do defenders never play such a service. Well here are some reasons why not! 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.079
 Because the ball must first hit your side of the table, you simply cannot serve hard 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.930
 like tennis where you can serve the ball directly over the net at a speed of 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.039
 more than 200 Km per hour. You will have to hit the ball a bit slower if you want the ball on both sides of the table. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.500
 There is really little space to cover the receiver. Because that's why it's one step 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.830
 reaching the entire area in which you can serve is simply not really effective. 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:03.758
 You still see some players serving for a long time, but they do this as a surprise tactic. 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:08.289
 They serve quickly when the receiver does not expect this 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.209
 However, they vary well with their spider and placement 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.500
 That is why the long fast 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.599
 predictable topspin service just don't cut wood. The only way to get away with a fast top-spin service is 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.879
 when you mask this 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:34.119
 You also see that top players do a strong short top spin service. 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.309
 They hope so with such a short top-spin service 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.269
 the receiver cannot read the amount of Spin properly and returns higher so that it can be attacked or 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:53.019
 they expect a flick from the receiver and are ready to counter this blow. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
 wow 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110
 wow
