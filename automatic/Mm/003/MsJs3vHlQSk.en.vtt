doing now today's community goal is
going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.380> be<00:00:10.610> loaders<00:00:11.610> any<00:00:11.969> type<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.690> loader

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
going to be loaders any type of loader

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.220 
going to be loaders any type of loader

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680 
gun loader exploder hot loader bad as
loader<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.279> idea<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.180> any<00:00:18.390> type<00:00:18.660> of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
loader you get the idea so any type of

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.900 
loader you get the idea so any type of
loader<00:00:19.020> will<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.279> challenge<00:00:20.580> in

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
loader will do for this challenge in

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.200 
loader will do for this challenge in
this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.900> probably<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.380> best<00:00:23.010> area<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this is probably the best area that I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.439 
this is probably the best area that I
can<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.380> will<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.910> for<00:00:26.910> farming

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
can think of that will be for farming

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.410 
can think of that will be for farming
these<00:00:27.630> loaders<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.740> end<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> line<00:00:29.369> has<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
these loaders the end of the line has a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.720 
these loaders the end of the line has a
mix<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.140> gun<00:00:31.410> loaders<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.769> exploders<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
mix of gun loaders and exploders the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.979 
mix of gun loaders and exploders the
reason<00:00:32.910> i<00:00:32.969> didn't<00:00:33.210> use<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.450> area<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:33.899> we

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
reason i didn't use this area when we

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.560 
reason i didn't use this area when we
had<00:00:34.170> 1,000,000<00:00:34.620> gun<00:00:34.860> loaders<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
had 1,000,000 gun loaders is because the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.330 
had 1,000,000 gun loaders is because the
exploders<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.440> took<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.829> some<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
exploders kind of took up some of the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340 
exploders kind of took up some of the
spawns<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> slowed<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> down<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
spawns and it kind of slowed it down a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.220 
spawns and it kind of slowed it down a
bit<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.680> now<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.100> anything<00:00:41.700> counts<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
bit but now that anything counts this is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.360 
bit but now that anything counts this is
by<00:00:43.710> far<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.040> best<00:00:44.520> place<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:46.370> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
by far the best place to do it in so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
by far the best place to do it in so
we're<00:00:47.489> making<00:00:47.730> our<00:00:47.820> way<00:00:47.850> over<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.629> highly

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
we're making our way over here I highly

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.000 
we're making our way over here I highly
recommend<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.399> bring<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.760> chain<00:00:51.090> lightning

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
recommend you bring a chain lightning

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
recommend you bring a chain lightning
for<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> throw<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> chain

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
for this because if you throw a chain

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.869 
for this because if you throw a chain
lightning<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.250> will<00:00:56.399> clear<00:00:56.730> out

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
lightning up there you will clear out

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.580 
lightning up there you will clear out
all<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.390> spawns<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> couple<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
all the spawns in just a couple of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.040 
all the spawns in just a couple of
seconds<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.430> don't<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.449> me<00:01:00.690> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
seconds but I don't have one on me so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.720 
seconds but I don't have one on me so
we're<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> take<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.520> out<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
we're just going to take them out the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
we're just going to take them out the
old-fashioned<00:01:03.270> way<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:04.379> shoot<00:01:04.739> them

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
old-fashioned way and just shoot them

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
old-fashioned way and just shoot them
all<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.390> there<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.049> would

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
all you can see right there that would

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.690 
all you can see right there that would
be<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.439> where<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> gun<00:01:08.010> loaders<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
be all where all the gun loaders in but

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
be all where all the gun loaders in but
since<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.270> exploders<00:01:10.200> there's<00:01:11.010> even

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
since there are exploders there's even

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.920 
since there are exploders there's even
more<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.850> kill<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> be

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
more to kill and there's going to be

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.600 
more to kill and there's going to be
three<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.470> come<00:01:13.619> down<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.040> hallway<00:01:14.310> over

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
three that come down this hallway over

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.020 
three that come down this hallway over
here<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.180> couple<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.110> keep<00:01:16.290> spawning

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
here a couple more that keep spawning

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
here a couple more that keep spawning
just<00:01:18.030> exploders<00:01:18.900> everywhere<00:01:19.470> basically<00:01:22.189> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
just exploders everywhere basically and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
just exploders everywhere basically and
there<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:23.850> once<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.540> done

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
there you go and then once you're done

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:34.719 
there you go and then once you're done
just<00:01:25.170> saving<00:01:25.710> quits<00:01:26.540> come<00:01:27.540> back<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
just saving quits come back in and just

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.010 
just saving quits come back in and just
make<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.909> way<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> loaders<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
make your way back to the loaders and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.249 
make your way back to the loaders and
start<00:01:37.409> murdering<00:01:37.770> those<00:01:38.220> loaders<00:01:38.900> now<00:01:39.900> this

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
start murdering those loaders now this

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.889 
start murdering those loaders now this
isn't<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.430> isn't<00:01:41.640> too<00:01:41.939> bad<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> load

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
isn't this isn't too bad on the load

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289 
isn't this isn't too bad on the load
times<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.530> console<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> small

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
times on console because it is a small

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.899 
times on console because it is a small
area<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.500> console<00:01:47.040> users<00:01:47.430> won't<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
area so console users won't have to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.440 
area so console users won't have to
worry<00:01:48.090> about<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.420> save<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.810> quit<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.430> much

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
worry about the save and quit as much

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.370 
worry about the save and quit as much
although<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.720> experience<00:01:52.320> some

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
although you will experience some

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.740 
although you will experience some
because<00:01:52.860> well<00:01:53.189> console<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.570> too

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
because well console but it's not too

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
because well console but it's not too
bad<00:01:54.960> anyway<00:01:55.740> guys<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.159> has<00:01:56.310> been<00:01:56.460> where<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
bad anyway guys this has been where to
