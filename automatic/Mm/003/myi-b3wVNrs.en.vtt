my<00:01:08.130> trap<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.670> raikou<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> I'd<00:01:09.479> rather<00:01:09.659> just

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
my trap with raikou and I'd rather just

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.080 
my trap with raikou and I'd rather just
you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.049> mill<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.650> no<00:01:10.770> more<00:01:11.280> monsters<00:01:11.490> and
