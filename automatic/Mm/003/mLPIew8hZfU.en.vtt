00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.360
 hello good afternoon I will answer 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.330
 any of the questions they asked 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.140
 here on facebook with pleasure 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.850
 and go paloma guillén ask me what is 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.980
 feels like waiting for so many years without debuting 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.080
 in the first division and what did you feel 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.890
 moment they told you that if you came to 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 tigers 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.400
 for the fact of waiting 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.530
 so many years yes 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.980
 and not being able to debut was a feeling of 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.980
 despair 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.510
 to be fighting and fighting and fighting 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.320
 and see that time and opportunities 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.530
 they are scarce but then at the time 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.899
 the opportunity came, it was first 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.290
 very nervous because then not 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.840
 I knew how it was going to be is really 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.750
 Well, already in an official match 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.880
 but it was usually to fill me with 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.140
 a lot of joy and crying 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.400
 a little bit really when it started at 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.530
 party that the match against chivas 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.050
 what did you feel a moment because I 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.870
 They said that if I came 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.440
 the truth I did not know what to feel was something 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.440
 I did not expect 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.940
 Well, it's good at that moment of leaving 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.500
 in a team it was within my reach 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.770
 I was in Querétaro a team that 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.700
 I was peeling descent I was 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.700
 completely in another situation 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.329
 it was like taking it a personal challenge 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.509
 I knew that I was going to change my life 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.509
 360 degrees 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.360
 fernando sauceda likes to ask me what 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.760
 feeling gives me to step on the court of 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.820
 volcano with full stadium and the fans 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.250
 supporting and that I thought the first time 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.370
 I played as 10 salt behaved tiger 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.790
 see the delivery of the pressure 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.310
 For what feeling I step on the court 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.000
 It gives a lot of satisfaction to see that people 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000
 supports you to the fullest 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.780
 in no time stop screaming of 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.920
 Supporting jumping is a sensation 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.349
 indescribable puts you skin chinita 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.360
 and that I felt the first time I played 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.080
 as a starter with with tigers in the league 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.270
 it was 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.210
 see realized a dream what 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.540
 As I told you, I did not have 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.219
 notice in the mind a few years ago 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.560
 in the best of my dreams I thought that 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:50.269
 out there is debuting such a team 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.269
 important as the steelers 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.970
 Kosher Moroccan asks me who 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.850
 he put the nickname of matute and why 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.620
 I really do not know why but I put it on 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:08.250
 a doorman who was called the boob 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.560
 I was in children of chivas and it was 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.290
 as at 34 since having started 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.150
 train now as 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.550
 as a registered goalkeeper because 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.880
 I had been on tests for a long time 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.650
 better that I looked nice with cat 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.970
 Well, I got so mad, you know that the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.470
 who gets angry loses and they started 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.650
 repeat it to repeat it to repeat it until 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.530
 that was until I 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.110
 that and Rodriguez asks if I 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.849
 like to retire with tigers is there 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.459
 wait, I just got here and I already 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.239
 I want to withdraw the truth I do not think 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.239
 now in retirement 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.300
 danny aguilar ask how it feels 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.300
 play a classic 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.560
 see what 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.490
 I had two different perspectives the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.380
 first was 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.410
 being on the bench in the classic in the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.200
 volcano in the second play a classic of 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.930
 league as the one to play in the state of 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.800
 scratched 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.810
 when you are on the court you do not reach 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.310
 to size what is happening to you 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.829
 around because then you are very involved 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.319
 on the court 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.720
 in the party you are concentrated and few 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:24.690
 Sometimes you hear the screams and 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.930
 everything that happens around you 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.100
 but the truth when I was in banking 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.370
 and that was here in the volcano 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.010
 I sincerely goosebumps are 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.740
 several on the bench commenting 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.290
 situations of those were to rivas that 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.410
 has lived many many classics and I 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.670
 He said that as I came from Chivas what 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.450
 difference there is between the chivas america and 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.460
 the striped tigers and then only me 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.290
 He said that he did not come from chivas that 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.260
 that chivas america that lives differently 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.530
 one speak when he whistled at the referee and 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.430
 they started singing sincerely I stayed 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.380
 without words and I do not know how to explain the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.450
 impression feeling that has to be 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.210
 here on the volcano in a classic like 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.610
 then it 's really impressive what 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.610
 that you live before and in a classic 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.289
 jorge barrier asks how much you have 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.460
 cost to become a professional goalie 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.460
 of the Mexican league 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.240
 it is to fight for 29 years 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.810
 imagine to be able to debut at first 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.190
 Imagine edition debut great to be 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.270
 fighting 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.300
 15 years practically an opportunity 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.650
 and at the time it is presented, it is 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.500
 you know there are few opportunities 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.270
 that are given in first vision then not 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.920
 you can hesitate, you have to do it with 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.430
 all 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.430
 Y 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.300
 the pixels 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.110
 the truth is that it has cost a lot 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.150
 cost quite but honestly not what 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.160
 will change for nothing would suffer again what 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.340
 same to be where I am 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.340
 right now 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.690
 jose angel ayala lopez asks me what 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.040
 keeper was my idol as a child 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.680
 really like I was going to the chivas of 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.750
 Well, the sun and ledesma was my era 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.700
 my idol many remember it with much 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.670
 love the sun and I send a strong 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.970
 hug 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.330
 and finally ask me about sanchez 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.330
 pelé or maradona 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.050
 for me for me 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.350
 as maybe as an athlete, fight but 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.230
 as a footballer to maradona for me 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.169
 mardones 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.960
 you are a magician 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.110
 and what happens what goes on in my head 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.819
 moment that you come to play tigers 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.150
 Well, I already told you that it was something 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.740
 that I did not contemplate in my 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.370
 career nor in my life at that time 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.129
 when I was in querétaro but because 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:09.319
 honestly it was like getting the lottery 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:09.319
 and right now I'm enjoying that 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:15.240
 well, I send a greeting to all of you 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.540
 all that are part of tigers 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.540
 official
