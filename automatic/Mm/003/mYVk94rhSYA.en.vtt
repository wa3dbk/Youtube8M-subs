00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 previously we had the vote for this 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.250
 I'm on both sides at the positions 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.869
 we have five or top positions 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.759
 then time do this laid out law 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.349
 I had a lot of small appliances 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.660
 yours will be over time 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.280
 what became bigger yes and that was 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.230
 there is a need for some larger ones 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:42.410
 top positions hence the very direction 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:44.210
 the baby's mean that you are 6 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.620
 citizen must return to 5 citizen who 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 also have all replaced so all 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.900
 we all stand that citizen 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.030
 new ones 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.860
 and all hydrants are kerosene 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.800
 supply for the aircraft 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.660
 This also all shifted the line that 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.540
 very vaguely visible here has that 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.729
 is the border of the old plane 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.079
 draws up position that old fox 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.720
 it is now completely on the wall 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.189
 meters shifted 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.200
 all old markings must be removed 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.100
 and get that scratch a 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.100
 idea years back 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.320
 what the last year after losing weight on 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.259
 what type it is you key them in 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.600
 on the one you get there on the album 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.820
 screen that the pilot is the pilot 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.830
 also can see hey this is natural 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.930
 type of device where I am flying 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.190
 so i have paid 90 the noise the top 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.190
 frame to many photos 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.310
 it went to extraordinary 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.380
 he stopped exactly where he did 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.780
 had to stop this must have a moist 9 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.220
 and that is not on the bridge 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.730
 is that I can get out there great passion 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.730
 I do n't complain
