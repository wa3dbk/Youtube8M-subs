or 15 minutes to get these things
balanced<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.030> don't<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.509> lucky<00:01:52.229> me<00:01:52.350> right

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
balanced so I don't know lucky me right

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.370 
balanced so I don't know lucky me right
so<00:01:53.280> along<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.880> 5d<00:01:54.270> mark<00:01:54.479> ii<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.930> i<00:01:54.960> have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
so along with my 5d mark ii here i have

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.039 
so along with my 5d mark ii here i have
a<00:01:55.409> Canon<00:01:55.950> 35<00:01:56.549> millimeter<00:01:57.119> wide<00:01:57.390> angle<00:01:57.840> lens

a Canon 35 millimeter wide angle lens

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
a Canon 35 millimeter wide angle lens
attached<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.399> always<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.700> good<00:01:59.850> rule<00:01:59.969> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
attached now it's always a good rule of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.450 
attached now it's always a good rule of
thumb<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.960> use<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> wide-angle<00:02:01.439> lens<00:02:01.740> when

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
thumb to use a wide-angle lens when

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.910 
thumb to use a wide-angle lens when
using<00:02:02.820> something<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.420> glidecam<00:02:03.990> because

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
using something like a glidecam because

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
using something like a glidecam because
no<00:02:05.369> matter<00:02:05.520> how<00:02:05.640> perfectly<00:02:06.270> balanced<00:02:06.810> your

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
no matter how perfectly balanced your

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
no matter how perfectly balanced your
rig<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.409> there's<00:02:08.129> always<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
rig is there's always going to be a

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.260 
rig is there's always going to be a
little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.629> sway<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.319> motion<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.160> would<00:02:12.000> say

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
little bit of sway in motion I would say

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.940 
little bit of sway in motion I would say
unwanted<00:02:12.989> motion<00:02:13.349> when<00:02:13.500> you're<00:02:13.620> out<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
unwanted motion when you're out in the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.400 
unwanted motion when you're out in the
field<00:02:14.010> shooting<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> wide-angle<00:02:16.140> lens

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
field shooting so with a wide-angle lens

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.050 
field shooting so with a wide-angle lens
you're<00:02:16.739> not<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.099> notice<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:18.030> one

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you're not going to notice that on one

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.640 
you're not going to notice that on one
emotion<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:18.840> much<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.319> you're<00:02:19.500> using

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
emotion as much if you're using

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470 
emotion as much if you're using
something<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.310> telephoto<00:02:20.819> lens<00:02:20.940> like<00:02:21.450> a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
something like a telephoto lens like a

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.900 
something like a telephoto lens like a
85<00:02:22.140> millimeter<00:02:22.620> you're<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.340> notice<00:02:23.580> that

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
85 millimeter you're gonna notice that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.360 
85 millimeter you're gonna notice that
motion<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.690> sway<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.230> lot<00:02:25.470> more<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:26.220> it's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
motion and sway a lot more so it's

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.770 
motion and sway a lot more so it's
always<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.640> good<00:02:26.849> rule<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.090> thumb<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.420> use<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
always a good rule of thumb to use a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.050 
always a good rule of thumb to use a
wide-angle<00:02:28.110> lens<00:02:28.379> if<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:29.879> any<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
wide-angle lens if you can so if any of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.280 
wide-angle lens if you can so if any of
you<00:02:30.150> guys<00:02:30.300> out<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:31.050> are<00:02:31.170> watching

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
should have the exact same balance rig

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.170 
should have the exact same balance rig
as<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.769> right<00:02:43.950> now<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.129> that's<00:02:44.610> cool<00:02:44.849> if

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.530 

so<00:02:58.190> basically<00:02:58.580> when<00:02:58.850> we're<00:02:58.970> attaching<00:02:59.270> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
so basically when we're attaching the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.540 
so basically when we're attaching the
camera<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.110> quick-release<00:03:00.440> plate<00:03:00.800> we

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
camera to the quick-release plate we

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.940 
camera to the quick-release plate we
want<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.850> keep<00:03:02.030> an<00:03:02.330> equal<00:03:02.990> distance<00:03:03.410> from<00:03:03.770> the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
want to keep an equal distance from the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.850 
want to keep an equal distance from the
lens<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:04.940> end<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.960> quick-release

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
lens to the end of the quick-release

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.040 
lens to the end of the quick-release
plate<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.430> also<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.180> back<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.660> camera<00:03:08.870> to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
plate and also the back of the camera to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.930 
plate and also the back of the camera to
the<00:03:09.260> back<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.740> quick-release<00:03:09.980> plate<00:03:10.280> that's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the back in a quick-release plate that's

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.310 
the back in a quick-release plate that's
just<00:03:11.150> my<00:03:11.300> rule<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.540> thumb<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.960> it<00:03:12.020> works<00:03:12.170> for

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
just my rule of thumb and it works for

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.490 
just my rule of thumb and it works for
me<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:13.190> what<00:03:13.820> we're<00:03:13.970> doing<00:03:14.000> today<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.570> on<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
me so what we're doing today is on the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.670 
me so what we're doing today is on the
bottom<00:03:15.890> here<00:03:16.250> you're<00:03:16.700> gonna<00:03:16.820> want<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.240> screw

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
bottom here you're gonna want to screw

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.350 
bottom here you're gonna want to screw
the<00:03:18.680> camera<00:03:18.950> into<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.700> quick-release<00:03:20.060> plate

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
the camera into the quick-release plate

these wings here at the bottom and
spread<00:03:51.370> them<00:03:51.520> out<00:03:51.640> as<00:03:51.910> far<00:03:52.150> as<00:03:52.300> they're<00:03:52.420> gonna

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
spread them out as far as they're gonna

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.170 
spread them out as far as they're gonna
go<00:03:52.780> okay<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:53.740> spread<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.430> wings<00:03:54.610> on<00:03:55.000> both

go okay so spread the wings on both
sides<00:03:55.750> as<00:03:56.050> far<00:03:56.170> as<00:03:56.500> they<00:03:56.620> can<00:03:56.680> go<00:03:56.950> out<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.430> put

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
sides as far as they can go out and put

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.699 
sides as far as they can go out and put
only<00:03:58.120> one<00:03:58.300> weight<00:03:58.720> on<00:03:58.900> there<00:03:59.050> okay<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.590> one

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
only one weight on there okay just one

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.270 
only one weight on there okay just one
weight

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.310 

so<00:04:03.030> after<00:04:03.270> you've<00:04:03.390> done<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.600> we<00:04:03.960> want<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.200> go

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
so after you've done that we want to go

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.260 
so after you've done that we want to go
down<00:04:04.410> here<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.740> the<00:04:04.830> shaft<00:04:05.100> area<00:04:05.580> where<00:04:06.150> we

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
down here to the shaft area where we

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.730 
down here to the shaft area where we
make<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.630> adjustments<00:04:07.140> time<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.440> make<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
make the adjustments time to make the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.700 
make the adjustments time to make the
shaft<00:04:07.950> longer<00:04:08.460> or<00:04:08.820> make<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.090> shorter<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.710> this

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
shaft longer or make it shorter and this

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.250 
shaft longer or make it shorter and this
is<00:04:10.890> an<00:04:11.100> exact<00:04:11.550> measurement<00:04:11.850> we<00:04:12.570> want<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.960> gap

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
is an exact measurement we want the gap

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.380 
is an exact measurement we want the gap
right<00:04:13.650> here<00:04:13.710> from<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.220> bottom<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.180> top<00:04:15.210> of

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
right here from the bottom to the top of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.440 
right here from the bottom to the top of
the<00:04:15.570> plastic<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:16.500> be<00:04:16.680> exactly<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.760> quarter<00:04:18.090> of

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
the plastic to be exactly a quarter of

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.900 
the plastic to be exactly a quarter of
an<00:04:18.600> inch<00:04:18.750> okay<00:04:19.140> exactly<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.100> quarter<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.790> an

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
an inch okay exactly a quarter of an

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.880 
an inch okay exactly a quarter of an
inch<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.630> make<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:21.900> adjustment<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.650> get<00:04:22.800> it

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
inch so make this adjustment and get it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.380 
inch so make this adjustment and get it
to<00:04:23.010> exactly<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.520> quarter<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.970> an<00:04:24.030> inch<00:04:24.120> and

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
to exactly a quarter of an inch and

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.890 
to exactly a quarter of an inch and
obviously<00:04:25.110> try<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.440> line<00:04:25.740> up<00:04:25.770> your<00:04:26.900> camera

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
obviously try to line up your camera

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.840 
obviously try to line up your camera
with<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.560> front<00:04:28.830> of<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.070> feet<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:29.670> it's

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
with the front of the feet here so it's

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.000 
with the front of the feet here so it's
exactly<00:04:30.600> straight<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.290> OHS<00:04:31.410> make<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.740> easier

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
exactly straight it OHS make it easier

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.610 
exactly straight it OHS make it easier
to<00:04:32.130> balance<00:04:32.520> when<00:04:32.880> we<00:04:33.060> go<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> next<00:04:33.540> step

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.980 

we're<00:04:37.310> gonna<00:04:37.400> want<00:04:37.639> to<00:04:37.700> do<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.120> two<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.780> three

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
we're gonna want to do the two to three

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.650 
we're gonna want to do the two to three
second<00:04:39.410> drop<00:04:39.710> test<00:04:40.130> now<00:04:41.030> that's<00:04:41.419> where<00:04:41.540> we

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
second drop test now that's where we

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.290 
second drop test now that's where we
take<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.200> rig<00:04:42.560> just<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:42.980> this<00:04:43.160> but<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.120> just

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
take the rig just like this but it just

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.270 
take the rig just like this but it just
like<00:04:44.450> that<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.960> we're<00:04:45.440> gonna<00:04:45.500> count<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.070> three

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
like that and we're gonna count to three

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.190 
like that and we're gonna count to three
and<00:04:46.310> see<00:04:46.790> if<00:04:46.910> we<00:04:47.030> got<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:47.810> let's<00:04:47.990> see<00:04:48.080> what

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
and see if we got it so let's see what

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.670 
and see if we got it so let's see what
happens

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
happens

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.040 
happens
one<00:04:49.330> two<00:04:50.380> three<00:04:51.460> pretty<00:04:52.460> good<00:04:52.639> not<00:04:53.450> bad<00:04:53.690> at<00:04:53.900> all

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
one two three pretty good not bad at all

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:04.300 
one two three pretty good not bad at all
looks<00:04:54.860> like<00:04:55.400> we<00:04:55.520> got<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.820> drop

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.640 

you

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.110 

we're<00:05:09.250> pretty<00:05:09.400> much<00:05:09.610> on<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.820> homestretch

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
we're pretty much on the homestretch

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.750 
we're pretty much on the homestretch
almost<00:05:10.750> done<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.830> basically<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.370> take<00:05:12.610> your

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
almost done so basically just take your

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.090 
almost done so basically just take your
unit<00:05:12.880> like<00:05:13.120> this<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:14.280> let<00:05:15.280> go<00:05:15.490> of<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:15.790> and

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
unit like this and let go of it and

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.470 
unit like this and let go of it and
you're<00:05:18.100> gonna<00:05:18.160> see<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:18.670> your<00:05:18.820> unit<00:05:19.120> isn't

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
you're gonna see that your unit isn't

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.540 
you're gonna see that your unit isn't
quite<00:05:19.720> balanced<00:05:20.170> yet<00:05:20.350> it's<00:05:20.890> definitely<00:05:21.400> gonna

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
quite balanced yet it's definitely gonna

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.760 
quite balanced yet it's definitely gonna
lean<00:05:21.850> either<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.690> left<00:05:22.720> or<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.650> right

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
lean either to the left or to the right

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.380 
lean either to the left or to the right
and<00:05:24.510> front<00:05:25.510> or<00:05:26.110> backwards<00:05:26.560> okay<00:05:26.920> so<00:05:27.760> this<00:05:28.240> is

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
and front or backwards okay so this is

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.330 
and front or backwards okay so this is
what<00:05:28.540> I<00:05:28.570> like<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.900> do<00:05:29.020> do<00:05:29.410> not<00:05:29.440> attempt<00:05:30.070> to

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
what I like to do do not attempt to

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.000 
what I like to do do not attempt to
adjust<00:05:30.730> them<00:05:30.940> both<00:05:31.150> at<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.330> same<00:05:31.420> time

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
adjust them both at the same time

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.800 
adjust them both at the same time
basically<00:05:33.010> get<00:05:33.340> your<00:05:33.520> forward<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:34.210> backwards

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
basically get your forward and backwards

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.370 
basically get your forward and backwards
motion<00:05:35.580> balanced<00:05:36.580> first<00:05:36.880> okay<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:38.140> if<00:05:38.230> your

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
motion balanced first okay so if your

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.130 
motion balanced first okay so if your
camera's<00:05:38.800> leaning<00:05:39.160> a<00:05:39.310> little<00:05:39.340> bit<00:05:39.610> forward

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
camera's leaning a little bit forward

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.410 
camera's leaning a little bit forward
take<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.260> knob<00:05:41.410> at<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.590> back<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.300> adjust<00:05:43.300> it

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
take the knob at the back and adjust it

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.410 
take the knob at the back and adjust it
so<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:44.620> weight<00:05:44.800> comes<00:05:45.070> back<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.700> until<00:05:46.390> that

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
so the weight comes back and until that

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.870 
so the weight comes back and until that
parts<00:05:46.840> balance<00:05:47.320> now<00:05:48.220> once<00:05:48.400> you've<00:05:48.550> got<00:05:48.580> that

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
parts balance now once you've got that

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.990 
parts balance now once you've got that
part<00:05:49.240> balanced<00:05:50.220> whichever<00:05:51.220> way<00:05:51.400> your<00:05:51.640> camera

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
part balanced whichever way your camera

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.180 
part balanced whichever way your camera
is<00:05:52.090> leaning<00:05:52.480> left<00:05:52.720> or<00:05:52.960> right<00:05:53.140> adjust<00:05:53.890> enough

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
is leaning left or right adjust enough

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.000 
is leaning left or right adjust enough
here<00:05:54.520> on<00:05:54.670> the<00:05:54.820> left<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.810> get<00:05:56.170> that<00:05:56.380> balance<00:05:56.590> and

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
here on the left to get that balance and

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.710 
here on the left to get that balance and
once<00:05:57.490> you've<00:05:57.670> done<00:05:57.880> that<00:05:58.090> you've<00:05:58.330> got<00:05:58.510> a

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
once you've done that you've got a

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.920 
once you've done that you've got a
balanced<00:05:59.290> rig<00:05:59.650> right<00:05:59.950> there<00:06:00.190> and<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:01.600> couple

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
balanced rig right there and a couple

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.720 
balanced rig right there and a couple
things<00:06:02.140> that<00:06:02.290> I<00:06:02.380> could<00:06:02.560> say<00:06:02.590> most<00:06:03.220> importantly

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
things that I could say most importantly

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.580 
things that I could say most importantly
is<00:06:03.940> when<00:06:04.510> you're<00:06:04.630> making<00:06:04.810> these<00:06:05.020> balancing

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
is when you're making these balancing

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.090 
is when you're making these balancing
adjustments<00:06:06.130> up<00:06:06.280> top<00:06:07.020> very<00:06:08.020> slight<00:06:08.620> turns

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
adjustments up top very slight turns

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.670 
adjustments up top very slight turns
okay<00:06:09.340> just<00:06:10.060> very<00:06:10.390> small<00:06:10.720> turns<00:06:10.990> make<00:06:11.290> a<00:06:11.320> huge

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
okay just very small turns make a huge

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.800 
okay just very small turns make a huge
difference<00:06:12.130> okay<00:06:12.370> so<00:06:13.000> if<00:06:13.390> you're<00:06:13.600> like

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
difference okay so if you're like

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.110 
difference okay so if you're like
turning<00:06:14.380> it<00:06:14.500> like<00:06:14.740> a<00:06:14.950> quarter<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.460> way<00:06:15.580> it's

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
turning it like a quarter the way it's

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.240 
turning it like a quarter the way it's
gonna<00:06:16.990> take<00:06:17.230> you<00:06:17.350> longer<00:06:17.500> to<00:06:17.650> balance<00:06:18.070> so

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
gonna take you longer to balance so

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.210 
gonna take you longer to balance so
towards<00:06:19.240> the<00:06:19.270> device<00:06:19.600> definitely<00:06:20.260> make<00:06:20.920> very

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
towards the device definitely make very

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.800 
towards the device definitely make very
small<00:06:21.580> adjustments<00:06:21.700> to<00:06:22.300> get<00:06:22.450> to<00:06:22.600> where<00:06:22.720> you

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
small adjustments to get to where you

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.620 
small adjustments to get to where you
need<00:06:22.840> to<00:06:22.990> be<00:06:23.220> so<00:06:24.220> that<00:06:24.400> is<00:06:24.550> pretty<00:06:24.730> much<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:25.000> the

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
need to be so that is pretty much it the

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.230 
need to be so that is pretty much it the
only<00:06:25.870> other<00:06:26.020> thing<00:06:26.230> I<00:06:26.380> can<00:06:26.410> say<00:06:26.800> is<00:06:27.240> probably

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
only other thing I can say is probably

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.490 
only other thing I can say is probably
one<00:06:28.540> of<00:06:28.570> the<00:06:28.660> most<00:06:28.840> important<00:06:29.260> things<00:06:29.380> I

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
one of the most important things I

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.350 
one of the most important things I
haven't<00:06:29.680> said<00:06:29.950> yet<00:06:30.160> number<00:06:30.790> one<00:06:30.970> make<00:06:31.330> sure

will throw it completely off I mean it's

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.970 
will throw it completely off I mean it's
balanced<00:06:42.700> now<00:06:42.850> but<00:06:43.120> just<00:06:43.330> this<00:06:43.720> little<00:06:44.260> lens
