00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.990
 Today she wants it 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:25.890
 steffi and steffi and we thought 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:27.930
 because we really youtube so much 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.090
 like to spend our time with it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.640
 Let's just try our reasons 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.100
 show you or say why does that want 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.890
 because find so great and maybe think 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.930
 yes, just like us, and then have a look 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 easy on 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 So the first reason why we youtube 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.520
 Life is when you are not always so good 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.520
 look to look 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:02.760
 especially British but the left and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.010
 how you like to watch it all the same 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 videos are meaningless 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:13.170
 since the video 1 but we are running 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.170
 have an overview single for that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:23.330
 so cheap and easy these people out 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 leadership 6 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.860
 The second reason why we like youtube 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.619
 Great is that you at the whole 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:39.420
 blogs and so always a great insight 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:41.970
 comes into the life of the region and which 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.750
 essens videos where to find something in 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.750
 private life 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.990
 the same life is about on 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:06.899
 the same level as you yourself 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:09.709
 he therefore better version of who the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.640
 third reason why to find the youtube 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.470
 is it is in our own 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.629
 Buying behavior always a bit like that 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.750
 calm or accommodate if I am 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.819
 so the wood of so whole certain 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.410
 Yeah , you look forgiving 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:32.910
 again a good feeling but it is 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.980
 Collect everything horn or any youtuber 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.440
 especially the American ones 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.379
 all a baker micra or louis 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.790
 vitton or chanel handbag 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.640
 So I have to say that honestly 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.670
 I really enjoy going so well - but me 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.400
 find a bit exaggerated what the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.300
 people partially has on at cosmetics 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.090
 then there are higher topics eyeshadows 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.180
 all brown but one has then 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.129
 find the finish and ultimately me 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.010
 I also much looks at it is over 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.010
 Of course, all the same with you are like that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.080
 there are people out there the lakes still 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.150
 worse is again a good conscience 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.720
 the fourth reason why b17 is piling up 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.340
 for us a kind of relaxing phase is 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.209
 or just take a break because especially in the evening 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.519
 simply the gws simply squat from the pc 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.659
 to drink a cappuccino and which one 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.750
 effects 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.180
 So I'm hoping that the risk of ice 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.099
 and somehow something so lonely 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.680
 you do not have to do anything but video 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.129
 despite being inspired yes and it's easy 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.200
 it's better than handicap 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.379
 has something entertaining in me 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.049
 appealing why so the man with the 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.790
 he or she is doing the topic 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.639
 just there should be the German 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.859
 maybe still watch that in the television 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:10.720
 teaching is not that so the experienced 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:12.430
 really earns the internet people on 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:21.370
 youtube that too a thing 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:22.990
 although it is still better the 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.000
 is now called with the video and 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.229
 hopefully you could maybe 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.260
 a little bit with us too 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.289
 identify or maybe you have 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.560
 all for a few customers why youtube so 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:38.320
 like to look or find so great if it is 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.669
 us know and just give them 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.050
 Thanks for watching and yes in the camera 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.050
 how much 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:21.509
 first reason boy out but if you are now 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.509
 Not
