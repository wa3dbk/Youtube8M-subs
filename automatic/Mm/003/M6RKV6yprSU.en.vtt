00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 And that's what it's all about, Daniel. 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.640
 and today I'll be bringing a tutorial 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.660
 for you to leave as you would be playing 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.579
 the way versus left ford two coffee land 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.099
 Xbox 360 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.460
 first you're going to have that one thing 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.180
 which is the requirement in this is a second 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 control you have to have at least two 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.260
 two players to be able to do 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.740
 that there is close start to the second 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.240
 control of black spot on the screen does 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.790
 log in 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:52.290
 of course you will have to have a profile 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:54.540
 leave it but if you 're not 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.750
 connected to the internet goes from there what you 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:03.320
 Give me an ok, go back and ask for it. 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.320
 load the profile of the second player to 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.380
 We have this beauty - I came here to play in 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.659
 off line team mode 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.539
 you can see that the campaign plays it 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.840
 putting me it works more common than 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:22.049
 the people most want is the versus mode 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 so you see here mode versus playing 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.280
 several play with friends select go 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.920
 appear to search for games and will not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.639
 find why you go is offline 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 without being connected to live and pressed x 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:44.700
 which is to create a lobby for this relative 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:49.109
 to school campaign low down here death 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.639
 it does not create lobby here that comes with 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.859
 first control is the second to choose 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:58.409
 Your character here will be the first 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:02:02.249
 I'll choose the unique and the second 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.630
 you choose the infected try one for 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:05.819
 each side 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.439
 can not play two as infected 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.439
 both as survivor 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.470
 soon after but that's where you are 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.959
 seeing that the screen is divided down or 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.940
 up depends on which one you chose 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.080
 will be there infected in case I am 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.890
 thinking I was infecting my eye 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.890
 down here 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.430
 then just follow this common game more 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.489
 remembering it is worth strengthening the idea 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.239
 that they can not do this method 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.250
 without being with the two controls 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:03:00.090
 connected here in the case of the demonstration 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:02.489
 to kill me deputy then the staff 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.220
 This was the tutorial I hope today 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.230
 I helped you guys if you liked it. 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.890
 click below and I liked it because it did not 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.209
 it will cost nothing any cent in just one 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.209
 one click time 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.670
 and taking advantage of the first click of God 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.109
 second in signing up 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.459
 this helps a lot there is also in the number of 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.190
 views 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.989
 I once again liked to reinforce this idea 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.910
 because it helps in spreading and if you 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.400
 I like too much is optional 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.200
 you add favorites and click on 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 sharing this one is already to your liking 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.049
 You're not bound to anything, just ask. 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.579
 your help and your motivation so if I 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.280
 I helped you, my help. 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.019
 so it was worth it and until the next tutorial until 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.500
 the next video until the next game play 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.500
 was
