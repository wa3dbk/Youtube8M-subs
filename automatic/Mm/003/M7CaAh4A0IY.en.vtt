a brand called mainstays I think they

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.440

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that's there in Walmart and it's a two

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.030 
that's there in Walmart and it's a two
tier<00:01:30.020> turntable<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.860> super

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
tier turntable and it was just super

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
tier turntable and it was just super
easy<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> assemble<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:33.840> pretty<00:01:34.350> sure

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
easy to assemble it was I'm pretty sure

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
easy to assemble it was I'm pretty sure
it<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.710> definitely<00:01:35.250> maybe<00:01:35.759> between<00:01:35.939> three

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it was definitely maybe between three

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.109 
it was definitely maybe between three
and<00:01:36.390> five<00:01:36.869> dollars<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.700> cheap

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and five dollars I think really cheap

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
and five dollars I think really cheap
and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.200> instantly<00:01:40.829> saw<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> thought

first<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.329> said<00:02:03.539> it's<00:02:03.719> by<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.380> mainstays

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
first so as I said it's by the mainstays

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.919 
first so as I said it's by the mainstays
brand<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> two-tiered<00:02:06.149> turntable<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
brand it's the two-tiered turntable and

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.109 
brand it's the two-tiered turntable and
when<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.250> all<00:02:08.519> assembled

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
when you get it it's not all assembled

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.300 
when you get it it's not all assembled
like<00:02:09.269> this<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.140> two<00:02:10.530> little<00:02:10.769> like

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
like this you get these two little like

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.180 
like this you get these two little like
discs<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:13.080> three<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.980> these

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
discs and then there are three of these

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.390 
discs and then there are three of these
I<00:02:14.670> guess<00:02:15.150> you'd<00:02:15.300> call<00:02:15.330> them<00:02:15.599> pillars<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:17.280> you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
I guess you'd call them pillars that you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.479 
I guess you'd call them pillars that you
just<00:02:17.580> snap<00:02:18.000> on<00:02:18.560> assembly<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.739> required<00:02:20.190> but

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
just snap on assembly is required but

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.430 
just snap on assembly is required but
very<00:02:20.760> easy<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.269> was<00:02:21.450> able<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.750> do<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:21.989> fine

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
I used and I often switch off on but you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.610 
I used and I often switch off on but you
can<00:03:11.549> see<00:03:11.700> how<00:03:11.850> easily<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.019> thing<00:03:13.380> just

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
can see how easily that this thing just

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.309 
can see how easily that this thing just
rotates<00:03:14.250> around<00:03:14.459> there<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:16.139> get

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
rotates around there and so you can get

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.170 
rotates around there and so you can get
like<00:03:16.590> three<00:03:16.950> hundred<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.370> sixty<00:03:17.730> degrees

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
like three hundred and sixty degrees

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.020 
like three hundred and sixty degrees
worth<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.410> know<00:03:19.530> items<00:03:20.010> on<00:03:20.220> there<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.850> can

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
worth of you know items on there you can

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.069 
worth of you know items on there you can
that<00:03:21.329> doesn't<00:03:21.630> make<00:03:21.720> sense

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
that doesn't make sense

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.020 
that doesn't make sense
if<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.889> can<00:03:22.980> get<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.130> lot<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.310> items<00:03:23.549> on<00:03:23.850> there

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.150 
if you can get a lot of items on there
and<00:03:24.209> access<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.900> all<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.319> way<00:03:25.410> around<00:03:25.560> instead

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.440 
and access it all the way around instead
of<00:03:26.250> having<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.549> reach<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.030> back<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.389> a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
of having to reach to the back of a

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.030 
of having to reach to the back of a
drawer<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.260> know<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.739> matter<00:03:28.769> of

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
drawer you know it's just a matter of

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.979 
drawer you know it's just a matter of
turning<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.549> around<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.150> thought<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.720> is

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
turning it around so I thought that is

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.569 
turning it around so I thought that is
so<00:03:31.019> cool

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
so cool

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.580 
so cool
so<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.880> enjoyed<00:03:33.329> that<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.870> then<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.079> thought<00:03:34.380> for

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
so I enjoyed that and then I thought for

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.309 
so I enjoyed that and then I thought for
the<00:03:34.680> top<00:03:35.239> what<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.269> was<00:03:36.450> planning<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.109> was

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
the top what I was planning to do was

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.539 
the top what I was planning to do was
putting<00:03:37.739> my<00:03:37.950> was<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.760> put<00:03:38.940> my<00:03:39.090> two<00:03:39.870> glass<00:03:40.549> brush

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
putting my was to put my two glass brush

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.699 
putting my was to put my two glass brush
holder<00:03:42.120> things<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.780> filled<00:03:43.170> with<00:03:43.290> like

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
holder things that I filled with like

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.059 
holder things that I filled with like
the<00:03:43.889> Sephora<00:03:44.250> style<00:03:45.090> beads<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.709> I

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
the Sephora style beads and and I

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.589 
the Sephora style beads and and I
thought<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.280> could<00:03:47.489> sit<00:03:47.670> those<00:03:47.819> up<00:03:48.000> top<00:03:48.269> but

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
thought I could sit those up top but

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.500 
thought I could sit those up top but
