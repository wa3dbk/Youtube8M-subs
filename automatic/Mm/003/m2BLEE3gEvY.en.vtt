00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.130 
too difficult to get stacks inside and
only<00:01:43.409> four<00:01:43.590> point<00:01:43.860> five<00:01:44.009> SPR<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.329> I'm<00:01:45.960> not

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
only four point five SPR so I'm not

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
only four point five SPR so I'm not
worried<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.460> love<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.700> fact

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
worried about that and I love the fact

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.609 
worried about that and I love the fact
that<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.570> middle<00:01:48.930> set<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.290> opposed<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that we have middle set as opposed to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.530 
that we have middle set as opposed to
top<00:01:49.890> set<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:50.969> a<00:01:51.000> lot<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
top set because now there are a lot of a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.800

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
sex type hands available so I don't

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
sex type hands available so I don't
really<00:01:55.049> love<00:01:55.290> checking<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.640> understand

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
really love checking and I understand

really love checking and I understand
your<00:01:57.390> point<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.719> far<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:57.960> trying<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> get<00:01:58.409> value

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
your point as far as trying to get value

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
your point as far as trying to get value
from<00:01:58.860> under<00:01:59.159> pairs<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.909> here's<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> truth<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
from under pairs but here's the truth of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.529 
from under pairs but here's the truth of
matter<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.829> texture<00:02:02.159> where<00:02:02.460> maybe<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
matter it's a texture where maybe you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.810 
matter it's a texture where maybe you
make<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.200> bet<00:02:04.500> from<00:02:04.860> an<00:02:05.009> under<00:02:05.219> pair<00:02:05.460> like

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
make one bet from an under pair like

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
make one bet from an under pair like
pocket<00:02:06.210> sixes<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:06.689> something<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.439> that's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
pocket sixes or something but that's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.880 
pocket sixes or something but that's
probably<00:02:08.009> about<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.479> he<00:02:10.080> ever<00:02:10.320> starts

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
probably about it and if he ever starts

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.400 
probably about it and if he ever starts

two-thirds on most turns okay I

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.089 
two-thirds on most turns okay I
definitely<00:03:14.620> agree

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
kind of jack fold so it's just one of

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.610 
kind of jack fold so it's just one of
those<00:03:34.239> were<00:03:34.419> like<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.720> don't<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:35.319> any

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
response to this I don't mind betting

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.179 
response to this I don't mind betting
two-thirds<00:03:37.959> on<00:03:38.139> turns<00:03:38.409> you<00:03:38.709> know<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.859> can<00:03:39.040> bet

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
two-thirds on turns you know you can bet

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.339 
two-thirds on turns you know you can bet
2<00:03:39.430> bucks<00:03:39.459> they're<00:03:39.909> resting<00:03:40.479> on<00:03:40.629> the<00:03:40.720> river<00:03:40.959> and

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
2 bucks they're resting on the river and

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.849 
2 bucks they're resting on the river and
it<00:03:41.889> works<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:43.150> again<00:03:43.629> all<00:03:43.989> this<00:03:44.260> really<00:03:44.470> boils

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
it works but again all this really boils

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.199 
it works but again all this really boils
back<00:03:44.919> to<00:03:45.159> the<00:03:45.250> fact<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.669> wouldn't<00:03:46.090> have

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
back to the fact that I wouldn't have

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.849 
back to the fact that I wouldn't have
checked<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.720> flop<00:03:46.900> in<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.169> first<00:03:47.379> place<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:47.829> I

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
checked the flop in the first place so I

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.860 
checked the flop in the first place so I
never<00:03:47.979> really<00:03:48.250> have<00:03:48.729> to<00:03:48.879> encounter<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.479> that

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
never really have to encounter this that

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.449 
never really have to encounter this that
being<00:03:50.109> said<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:50.530> 51<00:03:50.919> said<00:03:51.129> that<00:03:51.340> is

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
being said the 51 said that is

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.149 
being said the 51 said that is
definitely<00:03:51.909> super<00:03:52.479> atypical<00:03:53.229> but<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:53.799> just

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
definitely super atypical but I just

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.599 
definitely super atypical but I just
really<00:03:54.370> don't<00:03:54.459> find<00:03:54.790> myself<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.359> this<00:03:55.479> spot<00:03:55.720> so

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
say that and I'm not sure why we're

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.199 
say that and I'm not sure why we're
saying<00:04:14.349> that<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.650> mean<00:04:14.979> sure<00:04:15.280> he<00:04:15.669> could<00:04:15.909> bet<00:04:16.090> it

sometimes<00:04:16.659> but<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.799> know<00:04:17.829> if<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.489> look<00:04:18.669> at

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
sometimes but you know if you look at

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.699 
sometimes but you know if you look at
your<00:04:18.940> three<00:04:19.269> bet<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.690> then<00:04:19.840> check<00:04:20.139> Hall<00:04:20.409> on

have like a tremendous amount of sense
that<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.040> could<00:04:28.190> have<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.370> set<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.639> kings<00:04:28.910> but

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
that you could have a set of kings but

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.080 
that you could have a set of kings but
like<00:04:30.200> you're<00:04:30.380> gonna<00:04:30.500> have<00:04:30.800> things<00:04:31.100> like<00:04:31.520> king

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
like you're gonna have things like king

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.360 
like you're gonna have things like king
queen<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:32.450> maybe<00:04:33.169> like<00:04:33.410> East<00:04:33.680> Jack<00:04:34.070> type

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
queen and maybe like East Jack type

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.340 
queen and maybe like East Jack type
hands<00:04:34.700> like<00:04:35.060> you're<00:04:35.419> gonna<00:04:35.690> have<00:04:36.020> stuff

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
hands like you're gonna have stuff

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.530 
hands like you're gonna have stuff
that's<00:04:36.530> on<00:04:36.800> this<00:04:37.010> board<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:38.000> don't<00:04:38.450> really

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
that's on this board so I don't really

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.879 
that's on this board so I don't really
think<00:04:38.810> you're<00:04:38.930> gonna<00:04:38.990> induce<00:04:39.470> too<00:04:39.710> many

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
think you're gonna induce too many

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.560 
think you're gonna induce too many
Bluffs<00:04:40.190> here<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.490> I<00:04:40.520> kind<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:41.030> disagree<00:04:41.540> that

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
Bluffs here so I kind of disagree that

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.420 
Bluffs here so I kind of disagree that
we're<00:04:41.810> gonna<00:04:41.900> get<00:04:42.230> a<00:04:42.410> tremendous<00:04:42.830> amount<00:04:43.220> of

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
we're gonna get a tremendous amount of

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.390 
we're gonna get a tremendous amount of
value<00:04:44.360> from<00:04:45.110> early<00:04:45.440> positioned<00:04:45.919> Betty<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.340> a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
value from early positioned Betty and a

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.040 
value from early positioned Betty and a
super<00:04:46.700> wide<00:04:46.850> range<00:04:47.090> here<00:04:47.300> maybe<00:04:47.600> he<00:04:47.780> does<00:04:48.020> but

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
super wide range here maybe he does but

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.140 
super wide range here maybe he does but
I'm<00:04:48.620> I'm<00:04:49.100> not<00:04:49.160> really<00:04:49.400> confident<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.030> that's

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
I'm I'm not really confident that that's

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.780 
I'm I'm not really confident that that's
gonna<00:04:50.360> be<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.540> case<00:04:51.250> but<00:04:52.250> in<00:04:52.490> this<00:04:52.610> situation

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
gonna be the case but in this situation

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.850 
gonna be the case but in this situation
instead<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.510> facing<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:54.139> normal<00:04:54.470> bet<00:04:54.680> we

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
instead of facing a normal bet we

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.159 
instead of facing a normal bet we
actually<00:04:55.160> end<00:04:55.250> up<00:04:55.310> facing<00:04:55.669> a<00:04:55.790> shove<00:04:56.060> which<00:04:56.930> is

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
actually end up facing a shove which is

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.620 
actually end up facing a shove which is
obviously<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.830> little<00:04:58.040> bit<00:04:58.190> weird<00:04:58.550> now<00:04:58.820> in<00:04:59.510> this

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
obviously a little bit weird now in this

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.960 
obviously a little bit weird now in this
situation<00:05:00.340> Brandon<00:05:01.340> says<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.610> he's<00:05:01.760> never

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
gonna fold he doesn't expect that this

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.409 
gonna fold he doesn't expect that this
person<00:05:04.280> is<00:05:04.340> gonna<00:05:04.430> have<00:05:04.640> like<00:05:04.850> aces<00:05:05.240> or<00:05:05.390> kings

person is gonna have like aces or kings

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.040 
person is gonna have like aces or kings
or<00:05:05.840> Jack<00:05:06.020> tend<00:05:06.320> very<00:05:06.530> often<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:08.360> would

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
or Jack tend very often and I would

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.180 
or Jack tend very often and I would
agree<00:05:09.440> with<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:10.580> mean<00:05:11.000> sure<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.530> really

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
agree with that I mean sure I really

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.070 
agree with that I mean sure I really
heavily<00:05:13.580> discount<00:05:14.060> like<00:05:14.210> aces<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.720> kings<00:05:14.930> I

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
heavily discount like aces and kings I

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.659 
heavily discount like aces and kings I
don't<00:05:15.260> think<00:05:15.470> I'm<00:05:15.590> that's<00:05:15.890> getting<00:05:16.190> flatted

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
don't think I'm that's getting flatted

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.200 
don't think I'm that's getting flatted
prefix<00:05:17.270> out<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.630> time<00:05:17.840> at<00:05:18.020> this<00:05:18.140> limit<00:05:18.380> and

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
prefix out of the time at this limit and

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.640 
prefix out of the time at this limit and
sure<00:05:20.210> there<00:05:20.419> could<00:05:20.570> be<00:05:20.600> some<00:05:20.930> Jack<00:05:21.169> Tam<00:05:21.410> but<00:05:21.590> if

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
sure there could be some Jack Tam but if

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.290 
sure there could be some Jack Tam but if
it's<00:05:21.800> Jack<00:05:22.010> ten<00:05:22.220> it's<00:05:22.370> probably<00:05:22.639> suited<00:05:23.090> which

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
it's Jack ten it's probably suited which

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.000 
it's Jack ten it's probably suited which
puts<00:05:23.600> four<00:05:23.840> combos<00:05:24.350> of<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.680> so<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.830> don't<00:05:24.860> really

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
puts four combos of it so I don't really

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.100 
puts four combos of it so I don't really
care<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.850> he<00:05:26.389> could<00:05:26.660> definitely<00:05:26.870> be

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
care and he could definitely be

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.140 
care and he could definitely be
overvaluing<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:27.950> things<00:05:28.130> like<00:05:28.370> he's<00:05:28.729> king

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
overvaluing and things like he's king

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.980 
overvaluing and things like he's king
king<00:05:29.660> queen

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
king queen

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.500 
king queen
he's<00:05:30.650> queen<00:05:31.220> I<00:05:31.250> think<00:05:31.700> I<00:05:31.729> just<00:05:31.910> said<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.300> but

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
he's queen I think I just said that but

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.930 
he's queen I think I just said that but
those<00:05:33.020> kind<00:05:33.260> of<00:05:33.290> things<00:05:33.530> so<00:05:34.370> this<00:05:34.520> is<00:05:34.580> just<00:05:34.790> one

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
those kind of things so this is just one

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.250 
those kind of things so this is just one
of<00:05:34.970> those<00:05:35.120> where<00:05:35.330> yeah<00:05:35.630> I'm<00:05:35.750> just<00:05:35.900> never<00:05:36.110> gonna

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
of those where yeah I'm just never gonna

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.960 
of those where yeah I'm just never gonna
fold<00:05:36.530> I'm<00:05:36.710> just<00:05:36.860> gonna<00:05:36.979> pick<00:05:37.220> this<00:05:37.370> off<00:05:37.580> and

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
fold I'm just gonna pick this off and

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.150 
fold I'm just gonna pick this off and
rock<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.020> roll<00:05:39.140> and<00:05:39.350> go<00:05:39.440> from<00:05:39.650> there<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:39.860> feel

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
rock and roll and go from there and feel

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.980 
rock and roll and go from there and feel
very<00:05:40.550> comfortable<00:05:40.729> about<00:05:41.180> it<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.750> in<00:05:41.900> this

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
very comfortable about it and in this

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.540 
very comfortable about it and in this
situation<00:05:42.200> he<00:05:42.680> ends<00:05:42.800> up<00:05:42.919> having<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.310> flush<00:05:43.490> draw

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
situation he ends up having a flush draw

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.890 
situation he ends up having a flush draw
that<00:05:43.789> he<00:05:43.880> picked<00:05:44.060> up<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.419> turn<00:05:44.660> and

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
that he picked up on the turn and

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.020 
that he picked up on the turn and
shelled<00:05:45.140> with<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.740> obviously<00:05:46.400> we<00:05:46.550> held<00:05:46.789> which

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
shelled with and obviously we held which

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.140 
shelled with and obviously we held which
is<00:05:47.240> nice<00:05:47.539> to<00:05:47.900> happen<00:05:48.440> every<00:05:48.710> now<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.100> then<00:05:49.190> but

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
is nice to happen every now and then but

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.480 
is nice to happen every now and then but
again<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:51.200> main<00:05:51.410> point<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.830> this<00:05:51.979> hand<00:05:52.250> is

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
again the main point of this hand is

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.940 
again the main point of this hand is
really<00:05:53.000> the<00:05:53.360> results<00:05:53.870> it<00:05:54.080> isn't<00:05:54.440> really<00:05:54.919> even

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
really the results it isn't really even

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.890 
really the results it isn't really even
the<00:05:55.250> turn<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.820> when<00:05:56.240> you're<00:05:56.360> facing<00:05:56.600> the

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
the turn and when you're facing the

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.390 
the turn and when you're facing the
shove<00:05:57.110> it's<00:05:57.380> really<00:05:57.770> more<00:05:57.979> thinking<00:05:58.310> about

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
shove it's really more thinking about

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.040 
shove it's really more thinking about
the<00:05:58.669> flop<00:05:58.910> and<00:05:58.940> do<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.390> want<00:05:59.570> to<00:05:59.660> bet<00:05:59.810> it<00:05:59.930> or

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
the flop and do you want to bet it or

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.719 
the flop and do you want to bet it or
not<00:06:00.289> and<00:06:01.039> here's<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.370> truth<00:06:01.520> no<00:06:01.700> matter

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
not and here's the truth no matter

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.300 
not and here's the truth no matter
you're<00:06:02.240> gonna<00:06:02.360> bet<00:06:02.570> the<00:06:02.600> flop<00:06:02.930> in<00:06:03.320> a<00:06:03.800> decent

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
you're gonna bet the flop in a decent

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.890 
you're gonna bet the flop in a decent
chunk<00:06:04.430> of<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.669> time<00:06:04.850> or<00:06:05.210> at<00:06:05.300> least<00:06:05.419> a<00:06:05.510> very<00:06:05.690> non

but it's not gonna like deter me from
betting<00:06:18.919> it<00:06:19.100> because<00:06:19.760> when<00:06:20.180> he<00:06:20.300> has<00:06:20.539> something

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
betting it because when he has something

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.990 
betting it because when he has something
he's<00:06:21.169> gonna<00:06:21.289> get<00:06:21.500> super<00:06:21.890> sticky<00:06:22.310> when<00:06:22.850> he

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
doesn't he's gonna fold but I probably

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.290 
doesn't he's gonna fold but I probably
gonna<00:06:24.740> make<00:06:24.919> much<00:06:25.190> from<00:06:25.400> that<00:06:25.430> anyway<00:06:25.940> so<00:06:26.000> I'd

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
gonna make much from that anyway so I'd

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.360 
gonna make much from that anyway so I'd
rather<00:06:26.419> force<00:06:26.780> him<00:06:26.990> to<00:06:27.020> make<00:06:27.289> some<00:06:27.560> some<00:06:28.190> big

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
rather force him to make some some big

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.700 
rather force him to make some some big
Coleen<00:06:28.940> mistakes<00:06:29.390> then<00:06:29.810> try<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.110> get<00:06:30.289> like<00:06:30.470> one
