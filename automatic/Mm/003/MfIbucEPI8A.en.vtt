down<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> route<00:01:16.020> why<00:01:16.440> not<00:01:16.649> keep<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.190> how

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
down that route why not keep it up how

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.600 
down that route why not keep it up how
about<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.030> fight<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.660> we<00:01:19.080> life<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.740> even<00:01:20.160> we

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
which they have right this one actually

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.170

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
than Mario Party didn't even think to

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.070 
than Mario Party didn't even think to
have<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.400> is<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.450> generic

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
different than board game Island this

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.900 
different than board game Island this
board<00:04:38.680> game<00:04:38.740> had<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.130> travel<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.520> world<00:04:39.730> to

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
board game had you travel the world to

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.520 
board game had you travel the world to
take<00:04:40.060> photographs<00:04:40.270> at<00:04:40.690> certain<00:04:40.990> locations

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
take photographs at certain locations

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.530 
take photographs at certain locations
and<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.160> one<00:04:42.340> was<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.700> most<00:04:42.910> photographs<00:04:43.390> at

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
and the one was the most photographs at

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.960 
and the one was the most photographs at
the<00:04:43.660> end<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:44.140> all<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.470> turns<00:04:44.740> wins<00:04:45.220> I<00:04:45.640> thought

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
the end of all the turns wins I thought

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120 
the end of all the turns wins I thought
it<00:04:46.090> was<00:04:46.240> cluttered<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:47.020> boring<00:04:47.590> but<00:04:47.890> I<00:04:47.980> could

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
it was cluttered and boring but I could

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.440 
it was cluttered and boring but I could
see<00:04:48.250> someone<00:04:48.460> who<00:04:48.670> wants<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:48.940> more<00:04:49.090> complicated

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.990 
see someone who wants a more complicated
board<00:04:49.930> game<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.290> play<00:04:50.440> liking<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.460> but<00:04:51.700> to<00:04:51.850> me<00:04:51.970> I
