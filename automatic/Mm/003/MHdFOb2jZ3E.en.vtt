and pulling on the tape to activate it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.510 
and pulling on the tape to activate it
it's<00:01:18.990> basically<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> thin<00:01:19.950> piece<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.340> paper

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it's basically a thin piece of paper

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.109 
it's basically a thin piece of paper
with<00:01:20.790> wax<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.610> bit

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
past the end of the rose and that will

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.620 
past the end of the rose and that will
help<00:01:28.950> seal<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.460> any<00:01:29.610> moisture<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> doesn't

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
help seal in any moisture so it doesn't

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.280 
help seal in any moisture so it doesn't
dry<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.900> too<00:01:31.110> quickly<00:01:32.360> next<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.869> going
