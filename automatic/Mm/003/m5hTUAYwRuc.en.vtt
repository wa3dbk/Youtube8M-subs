00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 How to get a new motto view 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.759
 This time not a big murder but out 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:16.560
 certain reasons a normal mode and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:17.910
 this time it's about dynamic light us 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.340
 I just could see again 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.410
 my new intro now if you can 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 video please look right in the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.250
 Comment on how it finds important 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.170
 if you like it gives a thumb 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 if not on top of the video 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.050
 a thumb down on the video 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.579
 I want to know a very simple one 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.950
 info for eight seconds the perplexed 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.590
 not too long for you just be whole 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.640
 just kept a normal intro where 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.989
 a logo is created and you're done 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.070
 do you like it said above if 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.289
 not thumb down 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 this time now in the dynamic light and man 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.200
 I can see all sorts of things here 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 Keep things in hand and then 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.309
 we get light here I have to 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.110
 Of course and things keep the light 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.610
 I am producing with my ex 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.770
 playmate I was with the other day 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.210
 recorded and therefore unfortunately came one 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010
 Error then when recording that does me 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 suffering 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 though I've sometimes quite simple, the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 Small pieces built here should be easy 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.780
 just say here is more to the goal now 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.650
 grown i have the idea of hearing 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.420
 to rebuild 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.530
 I was not that dramatic here 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.330
 I test the best like that best 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.920
 is with the light also times when we 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.960
 Run through the area with light 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.580
 Let's just go for a torch and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.140
 Just do not think about it 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.509
 make the good is behind us too 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 slightly dark there are some 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.350
 Flashlights and they do the whole thing 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.659
 but not here you can do that very cool 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.040
 so that I will never be asked 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.970
 if you want it for example but also here 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.590
 make somebody a fire then they do 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.750
 Of course nothing is worth it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 mind you can already produce 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.200
 also a lot of light just 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.740
 it was not burning at the time 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.020
 so there are burned though but 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.340
 no unproduced example one can 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.140
 also with a loud block through the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.960
 walk around and does not do that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.189
 quite cool so now so said 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.229
 I can do that here as well 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.180
 do not show it here but about that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.120
 network 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.410
 your lighting so blv now here 12 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.340
 of course has a whole holds in hand 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.770
 other lighting 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.690
 if you keep the whole thing in hand then 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.500
 Sport around a rum, of course, no 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 monsters more 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.770
 So that's very handy if you are 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.430
 Now , for example, pine 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.209
 I hope kindles the expert working we 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.030
 go from him who gives course 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.380
 also not the lights and spread 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.790
 apparently also fire and it does so 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.350
 you can do that too, for example 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.750
 or you go for example a cave 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.100
 now but even though I am indeed 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.080
 in which I'm going to really cave 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.700
 explore myself to spoilers is times 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.810
 make more minecraft let's play again 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.459
 if you write the volt that too 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.350
 in the comments and come for example 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.480
 say I want to find but we could 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.890
 the ones with me and no flares nor mine 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 lover once run through the area 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.330
 goes to see my light or just 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.320
 runs with the torch through the area 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.200
 then you do not need so many lamps 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.150
 attach or simply with a red 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.800
 stuff you know so well I gave 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.390
 my redstone lamp with what should I 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.190
 do 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.090
 oh yes he was a column in the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.799
 split I can still remember that 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.269
 like a spider and skeleton and you can 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.920
 just say here for example 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.930
 put the jusos in the redstone lamps the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.549
 Otherwise you do not necessarily use 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.660
 you can just use it around 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.610
 to search a cave 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.200
 what he was the problem then when I was 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.340
 namely in the time table rats and 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
 facts but no normal times 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.120
 Oelerich 10x I see nothing is so 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.620
 dark and now you still have it 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.000
 a small right light radios 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.610
 of course, as blatant as the two 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.299
 here with it according to storm but on each 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.760
 case very big the bob comes to me 51 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.410
 if you like it then do it 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.830
 would not have with the intro rating 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.000
 the video with proven yes and I have 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.230
 I built a dirt hole, I know 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.450
 still like so no zombies here 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.230
 I'll throw in the whole 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.700
 day here 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.049
 I have my stuff a box 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.610
 business is here now before yours 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.190
 watch the game mode so you know 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.070
 I would have not so I'd 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.540
 say it was that of the dynamic light 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.610
 spot you have to go with everything 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.640
 progressed all her forge installation 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.750
