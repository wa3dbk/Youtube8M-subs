this tree but I believe you raised this
from<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.210> seed<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.990> that's<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
from a seed and that's one of the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.620 
from a seed and that's one of the
questions<00:00:11.130> I'm<00:00:11.759> often<00:00:12.110> asked<00:00:13.110> by<00:00:13.320> people<00:00:14.219> from

tree<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.869> pit<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> believe<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.859> have

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
tree from a pit but I believe you have

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:59.029 
tree from a pit but I believe you have
grown<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:23.850> from<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> pit<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:58.039> they

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
grown this one from the pit and they

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.790 
grown this one from the pit and they
last<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.420> hang<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> tree<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.379> about<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
last on the hang on the tree for about a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.570 
last on the hang on the tree for about a
year<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.539> often<00:01:03.750> find<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.589> falling

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
year so you often find that this falling

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
year so you often find that this falling
fruit<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.630> there's<00:01:06.780> blossom<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.290> growing

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
through the next year now what I'm

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.620 
through the next year now what I'm
pleased<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.390> growing

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
pleased about this is it's not growing

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.140 
pleased about this is it's not growing
very<00:01:18.900> vigorously<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> fears

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
very vigorously because one of the fears

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
very vigorously because one of the fears
of<00:01:21.240> doing<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:30.540> seems<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:39.590> seven<00:01:40.590> years<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
of doing it seems to be seven years and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.679 
of doing it seems to be seven years and
you<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.939> took<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:44.090> some<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> powers<00:01:45.479> that

idea what will happen and if you're in
your<00:03:40.980> little<00:03:41.280> space<00:03:41.519> then<00:03:42.090> you're<00:03:42.870> much

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
your little space then you're much

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.240 
your little space then you're much
better<00:03:43.230> off<00:03:43.290> buying<00:03:43.530> industry<00:03:43.889> have<00:03:44.010> known

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
better off buying industry have known

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.039 
better off buying industry have known
the<00:03:44.489> provenance<00:03:45.030> where<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.480> can<00:03:45.660> predict<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
the provenance where you can predict the

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.619 
the provenance where you can predict the
results<00:03:46.699> I've<00:03:47.699> mentioned<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.209> reasons<00:03:48.569> for

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
results I've mentioned the reasons for

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.140 
results I've mentioned the reasons for
this<00:03:48.810> elsewhere<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.769> maybe<00:03:50.609> we<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:50.910> enough

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
this elsewhere but maybe we got enough

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.939 
this elsewhere but maybe we got enough
space<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> really<00:03:52.139> wanted<00:03:52.379> to<00:03:52.530> do<00:03:52.680> this

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
space and you really wanted to do this

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.330 
space and you really wanted to do this
and<00:03:54.079> really<00:03:55.079> never<00:03:55.230> be<00:03:55.410> any<00:03:55.530> result<00:03:55.949> from<00:03:56.160> this

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and really never be any result from this

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:06.020 
and really never be any result from this
will<00:03:56.669> be<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.819> failure<00:03:57.120> will<00:03:57.510> it<00:04:04.669> what<00:04:05.669> I<00:04:05.699> was

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
will be a failure will it what I was

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.869 
will be a failure will it what I was
thinking<00:04:06.739> well<00:04:07.739> no<00:04:07.889> that<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.400> me<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.549> would<00:04:08.760> say

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
thinking well no that to me I would say

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.400 
thinking well no that to me I would say
that<00:04:09.030> they<00:04:09.090> were<00:04:09.180> probably<00:04:09.329> developing<00:04:10.019> first

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
that they were probably developing first

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.869 
that they were probably developing first
because<00:04:10.859> I<00:04:10.919> mean<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.370> new<00:04:11.549> growth

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
because I mean this is the new growth

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.140 
because I mean this is the new growth
from<00:04:12.209> 2013<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.440> May<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.549> it's<00:04:14.669> already<00:04:14.910> made<00:04:15.000> a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
from 2013 of May and it's already made a

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.500 
from 2013 of May and it's already made a
little<00:04:15.329> bit<00:04:15.449> of<00:04:15.569> growth<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:16.139> had<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> top<00:04:16.919> notes

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
little bit of growth I had the top notes

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.089 
little bit of growth I had the top notes
that's<00:04:18.510> pretty<00:04:18.780> good<00:04:19.079> ice<00:04:19.349> Crone

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
that's pretty good ice Crone

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.540 
that's pretty good ice Crone
six<00:04:20.370> inches<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:21.510> new<00:04:21.930> clean<00:04:22.380> growth

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
six inches of new clean growth

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.460 
six inches of new clean growth
yeah<00:04:25.479> cuz<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.750> mean<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:25.930> may<00:04:26.080> be<00:04:26.139> a<00:04:26.259> very

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
yeah cuz I mean this may be a very

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.330 
yeah cuz I mean this may be a very
vigorous<00:04:26.710> fraud<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.400> may<00:04:27.520> be<00:04:27.580> real<00:04:27.819> healthy

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
vigorous fraud it may be real healthy

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:41.550 
vigorous fraud it may be real healthy
something<00:04:30.340> inside<00:04:30.789> there<00:04:38.190> yeah<00:04:40.409> winter<00:04:41.409> moth

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
something inside there yeah winter moth

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.670 
something inside there yeah winter moth
caterpillar<00:04:42.069> so<00:04:42.789> what's<00:04:42.940> one<00:04:43.120> less<00:04:43.470> all<00:04:44.470> right

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
caterpillar so what's one less all right

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.999 
caterpillar so what's one less all right
in

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
in

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.020 
in
