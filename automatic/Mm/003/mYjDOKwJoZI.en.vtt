00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
invisibility potion it makes no

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.750 
invisibility potion it makes no
difference<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.769> so<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.339> sure<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.519> leave<00:00:53.670> a

and there are so many skeletons

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.620 
and there are so many skeletons
attacking<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.909> could<00:01:24.030> probably<00:01:24.119> notice

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
attacking as you could probably notice

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.599 
attacking as you could probably notice
some<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.289> armor<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> some

some of them do have armor on and some

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.580 
some of them do have armor on and some
of<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.820> enchanted<00:01:27.390> bows<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.500> how

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of them enchanted bows that's just how

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.410 
of them enchanted bows that's just how
skeletons<00:01:29.070> spawn<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.149> much<00:01:30.270> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
skeletons spawn and really not much I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.730 
skeletons spawn and really not much I
could<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.929> but<00:01:31.140> honestly<00:01:31.530> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
could do about it but honestly they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.149 
could do about it but honestly they
probably<00:01:31.770> need<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> advantage<00:01:33.299> anyway

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
probably need the advantage anyway

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.919 
probably need the advantage anyway
because<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> Hydra<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.179> powerful

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
because the Hydra is so powerful

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.770 
because the Hydra is so powerful
oh<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.590> head<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.859> down<00:01:38.219> Wow<00:01:38.729> didn't<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.659> that

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
kind of shows how strong skeletons can

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.510 
kind of shows how strong skeletons can
be<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.350> group<00:03:34.380> cuz<00:03:34.740> they<00:03:34.860> really<00:03:35.160> took<00:03:35.370> him

a good view from here look at all those

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.880 
a good view from here look at all those

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
skeletons there are so many can the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.610 
skeletons there are so many can the
Hydra<00:03:50.310> kill<00:03:50.520> every<00:03:51.060> single<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.540> let<00:03:52.350> me<00:03:52.380> try

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
to get a little bit further down

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.330 
to get a little bit further down
oh<00:03:53.820> we<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:54.360> killed<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.660> one<00:03:54.810> with<00:03:54.930> fire

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
oh we just killed that one with fire

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
shoot and fire all over the place but

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.480 
shoot and fire all over the place but
look<00:03:57.840> at<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.020> massive<00:03:58.500> amount<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.980> skeletons

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
look at the massive amount of skeletons

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.760 
look at the massive amount of skeletons
around<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.600> would<00:04:00.660> seize<00:04:00.870> me<00:04:01.050> don't<00:04:01.440> look<00:04:01.650> at

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
around that would seize me don't look at

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.430 
around that would seize me don't look at
me<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.630> good<00:04:03.750> thing<00:04:03.960> is<00:04:04.110> they<00:04:04.290> can

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
me and the good thing is they can

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.720 
me and the good thing is they can
actually<00:04:04.710> like<00:04:04.830> take<00:04:05.070> their<00:04:05.250> heads<00:04:05.430> down

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
actually like take their heads down

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.280 
actually like take their heads down
which<00:04:05.880> is<00:04:06.000> awesome<00:04:06.450> since<00:04:06.630> they're<00:04:06.810> ranged

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
which is awesome since they're ranged

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.860 
which is awesome since they're ranged
and<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:08.610> pretty<00:04:08.820> much<00:04:08.910> means<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.660> um

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
and that pretty much means that um

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.720 
and that pretty much means that um
there's<00:04:10.260> gonna<00:04:10.350> be<00:04:10.560> tons<00:04:10.860> of<00:04:11.130> them<00:04:11.310> attacking

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
there's gonna be tons of them attacking

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.510 
there's gonna be tons of them attacking
again<00:04:12.150> like<00:04:12.330> 6<00:04:12.720> heads<00:04:12.960> on<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.260> Hydra<00:04:13.740> it<00:04:14.310> makes

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
again like 6 heads on the Hydra it makes

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.789 
again like 6 heads on the Hydra it makes
it<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:14.790> much<00:04:14.910> more<00:04:14.970> exciting<00:04:15.380> and<00:04:16.380> one<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.710> them

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
it so much more exciting and one of them

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.830 
it so much more exciting and one of them
is<00:04:16.950> down<00:04:17.190> once<00:04:17.460> again<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:17.940> think<00:04:18.000> -<00:04:18.299> actually

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
is down once again I think - actually

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.390 
is down once again I think - actually
he's<00:04:19.410> got<00:04:19.560> like<00:04:19.680> one<00:04:19.830> head<00:04:20.010> right<00:04:20.160> now<00:04:20.250> he's

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
he's got like one head right now he's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.300 
he's got like one head right now he's
regrowing<00:04:21.140> alright<00:04:22.140> here<00:04:22.290> he<00:04:22.320> goes<00:04:22.560> now<00:04:22.920> the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
regrowing alright here he goes now the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.850 
regrowing alright here he goes now the
Hydra<00:04:23.850> is<00:04:24.000> getting<00:04:24.360> epic<00:04:24.750> once<00:04:24.990> again<00:04:25.350> he's

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
Hydra is getting epic once again he's

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.260 
Hydra is getting epic once again he's
almost<00:04:26.130> half<00:04:26.280> down<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:26.669> helped<00:04:26.910> though<00:04:27.030> I

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
almost half down and helped though I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.249 
think he's got five heads
tons<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.740> skeletons<00:04:30.430> are<00:04:30.580> still<00:04:30.880> here<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.509> mean

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
tons of skeletons are still here I mean

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.219 
tons of skeletons are still here I mean
they're<00:04:32.410> like<00:04:32.530> everywhere<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.930> fire

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
moves are so powerful I mean they die

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.610 
moves are so powerful I mean they die
pretty<00:04:37.449> much<00:04:37.660> instantly<00:04:38.229> when<00:04:38.470> they're

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
pretty much instantly when they're

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.689 
Hydra all right only the ones in the
corner<00:04:55.780> seem<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.139> be<00:04:56.229> left<00:04:56.440> alive<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.520> is

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
corner seem to be left alive and that is

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.670 
corner seem to be left alive and that is
a<00:04:57.729> lot<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.150> fire<00:04:58.600> right<00:04:58.870> there<00:04:59.139> that<00:04:59.530> was<00:04:59.650> a

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
a lot of fire right there that was a

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.350 
a lot of fire right there that was a
tonic<00:05:00.400> Hydra<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.389> below<00:05:01.750> half<00:05:02.050> health<00:05:02.080> now

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
tonic Hydra is below half health now

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.790 
tonic Hydra is below half health now
skeletons<00:05:04.360> still<00:05:04.630> alive<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.199> just<00:05:05.380> saw<00:05:05.440> one<00:05:05.650> go

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
skeletons still alive I just saw one go

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.650 
skeletons still alive I just saw one go
down<00:05:06.009> and<00:05:06.310> one<00:05:06.460> gets<00:05:06.610> smacked<00:05:07.060> by<00:05:07.360> it's<00:05:07.509> like

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
down and one gets smacked by it's like

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.770 
down and one gets smacked by it's like
tail<00:05:08.639> either<00:05:09.639> starting<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.060> die<00:05:10.180> off<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.570> one

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
tail either starting to die off that one

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.560 
tail either starting to die off that one
is<00:05:10.990> getting<00:05:11.770> annihilated<00:05:12.099> another<00:05:13.030> one<00:05:13.300> down

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
is getting annihilated another one down

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.080 
is getting annihilated another one down
not<00:05:14.349> too<00:05:14.500> many<00:05:14.650> left<00:05:14.860> we<00:05:15.639> might<00:05:15.789> have<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:15.970> try

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
not too many left we might have to try

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.390 
not too many left we might have to try
like<00:05:16.300> 75<00:05:17.080> against<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.530> Hydra<00:05:17.889> if<00:05:18.009> he<00:05:18.099> does<00:05:18.280> it

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
like 75 against the Hydra if he does it

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.890 
like 75 against the Hydra if he does it
easily<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.050> only<00:05:20.380> see<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.860> few<00:05:21.220> skeletons

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
easily and I only see a few skeletons

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.060 
easily and I only see a few skeletons
hydras<00:05:22.900> facing<00:05:23.199> towards<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:23.560> one<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.949> is

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
hydras facing towards that one it is

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.850 
hydras facing towards that one it is
dead<00:05:24.340> okay<00:05:25.090> so<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.539> looks<00:05:25.780> like<00:05:26.080> are<00:05:26.680> there<00:05:26.800> any

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
dead okay so it looks like are there any

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.890 
dead okay so it looks like are there any
left<00:05:27.160> alive<00:05:27.460> I<00:05:27.759> think<00:05:28.060> there<00:05:28.389> was<00:05:28.509> one<00:05:28.539> right

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
left alive I think there was one right

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.010 
left alive I think there was one right
there<00:05:29.139> that<00:05:29.349> might<00:05:30.160> be<00:05:30.280> it<00:05:30.400> guys<00:05:30.639> I<00:05:30.970> think<00:05:31.930> the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
there that might be it guys I think the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.770 
there that might be it guys I think the
Hydra<00:05:32.470> may<00:05:32.770> have<00:05:33.130> won<00:05:33.490> this<00:05:33.699> round<00:05:33.760> once<00:05:34.479> again

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
Hydra may have won this round once again

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.830 
Hydra may have won this round once again
let's<00:05:35.229> take<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.380> look<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.300> know<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:37.510> Hydra

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
let's take a look so you know the Hydra

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.100 
let's take a look so you know the Hydra
one<00:05:38.020> looked<00:05:38.199> 49<00:05:38.889> we're<00:05:39.250> gonna<00:05:39.340> try<00:05:39.639> 75<00:05:40.630> in<00:05:40.990> the

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
one looked 49 we're gonna try 75 in the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.050 
one looked 49 we're gonna try 75 in the
last<00:05:41.320> round<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:41.860> see<00:05:42.039> if<00:05:42.099> the<00:05:42.220> Hydra<00:05:42.639> can<00:05:42.849> win

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
last round and see if the Hydra can win

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
last round and see if the Hydra can win
once<00:05:43.360> again<00:05:43.510> this<00:05:44.440> mob<00:05:44.710> is<00:05:44.919> so<00:05:45.130> epic<00:05:45.900> all<00:05:46.900> right

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
once again this mob is so epic all right

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.750 
once again this mob is so epic all right
guys<00:05:47.260> we<00:05:47.409> are<00:05:47.500> on<00:05:47.650> to<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:47.830> final<00:05:48.310> match<00:05:48.520> and

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
guys we are on to the final match and

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.210 
guys we are on to the final match and
it's<00:05:48.909> gonna<00:05:49.060> be<00:05:49.240> 75<00:05:49.840> skeletons<00:05:50.740> against<00:05:51.130> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
it's gonna be 75 skeletons against the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.120 
it's gonna be 75 skeletons against the
Hydra<00:05:51.610> this<00:05:51.849> one<00:05:52.150> is<00:05:52.389> gonna<00:05:52.630> be<00:05:52.780> intense<00:05:53.260> can

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
Hydra this one is gonna be intense can

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.350 
Hydra this one is gonna be intense can
the<00:05:54.220> Hydra<00:05:54.520> really<00:05:54.789> pull<00:05:55.000> out<00:05:55.090> another

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
the Hydra really pull out another

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.930 
the Hydra really pull out another
victory<00:05:55.750> we're<00:05:56.349> about<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.650> see<00:05:56.860> I<00:05:57.130> can't

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
victory we're about to see I can't

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.600 
victory we're about to see I can't
believe<00:05:58.120> he<00:05:58.210> killed<00:05:58.389> 60<00:05:59.020> pretty<00:05:59.860> amazing<00:06:00.400> all

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
believe he killed 60 pretty amazing all

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.529 
believe he killed 60 pretty amazing all
right<00:06:00.759> 75<00:06:01.270> against<00:06:02.229> him<00:06:02.440> and<00:06:03.340> here<00:06:03.820> we<00:06:03.909> go<00:06:04.060> that

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
right 75 against him and here we go that

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.629 
right 75 against him and here we go that
is<00:06:04.570> a<00:06:04.720> ton<00:06:05.259> of<00:06:05.289> skeletons<00:06:06.099> you<00:06:06.250> can<00:06:06.370> see<00:06:06.520> he's

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
is a ton of skeletons you can see he's

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.180 
is a ton of skeletons you can see he's
taking<00:06:06.970> a<00:06:07.060> lot<00:06:07.240> of<00:06:07.270> damage<00:06:07.539> already<00:06:08.110> in<00:06:09.070> a

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
taking a lot of damage already in a

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.560 
taking a lot of damage already in a
bigger<00:06:09.370> take<00:06:09.580> out<00:06:09.729> one<00:06:09.849> of<00:06:09.880> his<00:06:10.030> head's<00:06:10.270> real

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
bigger take out one of his head's real

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.969 
bigger take out one of his head's real
quick<00:06:10.870> it<00:06:11.020> might<00:06:11.169> actually<00:06:11.440> give<00:06:11.860> an

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
quick it might actually give an

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.129 
quick it might actually give an
advantage<00:06:12.310> to<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.759> Hydra<00:06:13.150> like<00:06:13.539> so<00:06:13.930> many

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
advantage to the Hydra like so many

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.080 
advantage to the Hydra like so many
heads<00:06:14.349> attacking<00:06:14.979> might<00:06:15.669> be<00:06:15.789> able<00:06:15.880> to<00:06:15.940> win

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
heads attacking might be able to win

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.180 
heads attacking might be able to win
this<00:06:16.240> and<00:06:16.630> you<00:06:17.020> can<00:06:17.199> see<00:06:17.349> it's<00:06:17.500> really<00:06:17.770> hard<00:06:18.039> to

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
this and you can see it's really hard to

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.800 
this and you can see it's really hard to
get<00:06:18.310> into<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.610> right<00:06:18.729> position<00:06:18.909> like<00:06:19.419> viewing

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
get into the right position like viewing

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.659 
get into the right position like viewing
this<00:06:19.930> battle<00:06:20.409> then<00:06:21.009> they<00:06:21.099> try<00:06:21.280> to<00:06:21.340> be<00:06:21.490> close

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
this battle then they try to be close

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.010 
this battle then they try to be close
enough<00:06:21.849> or<00:06:22.030> you<00:06:22.120> can<00:06:22.240> actually<00:06:22.419> see<00:06:22.750> like<00:06:22.900> the

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
enough or you can actually see like the

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.100 
enough or you can actually see like the
fire<00:06:23.320> attacks<00:06:23.860> and<00:06:24.220> sometimes<00:06:25.210> it's<00:06:25.810> hard<00:06:26.080> to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
fire attacks and sometimes it's hard to

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.620 
fire attacks and sometimes it's hard to
be<00:06:26.259> close<00:06:26.440> enough<00:06:26.849> but<00:06:27.849> look<00:06:28.000> at<00:06:28.090> the<00:06:28.180> massive

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
be close enough but look at the massive

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.480 
be close enough but look at the massive
amount<00:06:28.990> of<00:06:29.110> skeletons<00:06:29.740> it's<00:06:29.919> pretty<00:06:30.159> crazy

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
amount of skeletons it's pretty crazy

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.080 
amount of skeletons it's pretty crazy
and<00:06:31.110> the<00:06:32.110> Hydra<00:06:32.680> is<00:06:32.860> taking<00:06:33.520> some<00:06:33.849> serious

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
and the Hydra is taking some serious

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.330 
and the Hydra is taking some serious
damage<00:06:34.419> trying<00:06:35.080> to<00:06:35.349> kill<00:06:35.560> them<00:06:35.680> off<00:06:35.830> and<00:06:36.310> try

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
damage trying to kill them off and try

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.610 
damage trying to kill them off and try
not<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.360> attack<00:06:37.630> me<00:06:37.810> all<00:06:38.139> right<00:06:38.260> let<00:06:38.349> me<00:06:38.380> switch

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
not to attack me all right let me switch

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.379 
not to attack me all right let me switch
positions<00:06:39.099> here<00:06:39.310> look<00:06:39.700> how<00:06:39.880> many<00:06:40.090> there<00:06:40.180> are

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 
positions here look how many there are

you're gonna survive there's like three

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.469 
you're gonna survive there's like three
heads<00:07:22.949> shooting<00:07:23.370> fire<00:07:23.669> at<00:07:23.909> one<00:07:24.180> they<00:07:24.360> only

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
heads shooting fire at one they only

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.399 
heads shooting fire at one they only
have<00:07:24.659> 20<00:07:24.990> health<00:07:25.169> so<00:07:25.529> they<00:07:26.219> die<00:07:26.430> pretty<00:07:26.669> easily

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:27.409 
have 20 health so they die pretty easily

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:29.929 
have 20 health so they die pretty easily
yeah<00:07:28.409> only<00:07:28.590> a<00:07:28.770> few<00:07:29.009> left<00:07:29.219> I<00:07:29.310> think<00:07:29.370> the<00:07:29.550> hydras

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:29.939 
yeah only a few left I think the hydras

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:31.610 
yeah only a few left I think the hydras
doing<00:07:30.180> even<00:07:30.449> better<00:07:30.659> than<00:07:30.960> last<00:07:31.139> round<00:07:31.469> this

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
doing even better than last round this

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.309 
doing even better than last round this
might<00:07:31.830> be<00:07:31.919> his<00:07:32.009> best<00:07:32.189> round<00:07:32.430> so<00:07:32.669> far<00:07:33.020> so<00:07:34.020> many

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 
might be his best round so far so many

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.990 
might be his best round so far so many
of<00:07:34.500> the<00:07:34.589> skeletons<00:07:35.099> are<00:07:35.189> already<00:07:35.490> dead<00:07:35.729> I

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 
of the skeletons are already dead I

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.999 
of the skeletons are already dead I
could<00:07:36.689> see<00:07:36.930> them<00:07:37.020> like<00:07:37.169> shooting<00:07:37.439> arrows<00:07:37.770> and

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:38.009 
could see them like shooting arrows and

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:40.629 
could see them like shooting arrows and
getting<00:07:38.460> completely<00:07:38.639> owned<00:07:39.449> from<00:07:39.689> the<00:07:39.839> fire

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 
getting completely owned from the fire

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.249 
getting completely owned from the fire
only<00:07:41.639> a<00:07:41.909> few<00:07:42.240> in<00:07:42.360> that<00:07:42.509> corner<00:07:42.930> that's<00:07:43.110> all<00:07:43.229> I

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 
only a few in that corner that's all I

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.519 
only a few in that corner that's all I
see<00:07:43.699> looks<00:07:44.699> like<00:07:44.849> the<00:07:44.969> Hydra<00:07:45.389> is<00:07:45.539> once<00:07:45.930> again

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:46.529

Hydra<00:07:57.000> winning<00:07:57.419> once<00:07:57.719> again<00:07:58.259> there's<00:07:58.500> no<00:07:58.560> way

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 
Hydra winning once again there's no way

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.889 
Hydra winning once again there's no way
they<00:07:58.949> can<00:07:59.009> come<00:07:59.250> back<00:07:59.279> here<00:07:59.759> so<00:08:00.569> it<00:08:00.689> looks<00:08:00.839> like

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:00.899 
they can come back here so it looks like

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:03.619 
they can come back here so it looks like
the<00:08:01.080> Hydra<00:08:01.620> has<00:08:01.830> won<00:08:02.129> once<00:08:02.580> again<00:08:02.969> won<00:08:03.180> every
