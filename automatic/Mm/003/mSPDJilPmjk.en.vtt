00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.069
 This is another tutorial from 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.880
 life and today specifically a tutorial 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.880
 of mechanics 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.289
 today we will see how to fix a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.180
 common problem alienated the speedometer 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.430
 which does not mark 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 most of the time it happens 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.689
 guilty is the speed sensor and it is 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 very similar across the hello line and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.810
 its location does not change much from 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.750
 shown in this climate is this guy there's 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.559
 red circle view ii where is the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.690
 sensor 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.200
 The first thing we will do is 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.200
 there 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.270
 the first thing is to remove the connector 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.270
 given state 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.079
 the removed connector holds firmly in the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.940
 sensor body that sought force 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.190
 do not forget to do this with the engine 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:15.880
 cold because as you see there on the side and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.880
 exhaust from the engine but 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:29.330
 first place the key in the ignition 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.970
 the steering wheel with one hand and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.670
 with the other hand on the key without giving 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.710
 starting in the car keeping the button 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.130
 pressed for five seconds 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.259
 This will start the panel test 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.810
 make sure that the speedometer 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.270
 up and down as in the video your panel 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.789
 is perfect and the problem can be the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.789
 sensor otherwise the problem is the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.070
 panel I will now show how 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.390
 fixes and sense by avoiding spending 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.390
 money with new sensor 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.189
 where each turn that the wheel of the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.920
 he presses a button in there 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:12.680
 this way to continue 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.019
 we need to open the sensor and for that 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.720
 we put a knife in the joint that has 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.010
 at this point and make a force of form 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.019
 distributed 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.019
 so we can get the sensor 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.489
 on this part of the sensor we have three pins 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.409
 a side where the connector connects and 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.510
 another side we have a circuit where there is 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.319
 soldering points that secure these 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.180
 the passing of the heat time is the 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.849
 These release points 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.269
 soldering is broken causing bad contact 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.610
 prevents the speedometer function which 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.340
 we do here is make that left at 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.620
 top of these three pins 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.659
 we do not need to put stranger 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.280
 only to retain what is already there will be 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.269
 sufficient for the resolution of the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.209
 only a problem of retaliation already 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.709
 and wait for it to cool again. 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.209
 taking care that it does not touch 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.489
 the other terminals and 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.160
 Do this with care and without 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.739
 Make sure the tin droplet 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.000
 do not leave her place and touch others 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.609
 parts of the circuit 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.510
 if this happens to 7 the shit before 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.510
 to put in the car 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.010
 are these three points marked in the photo 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.180
 done the solder now we clean the glue 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:56.819
 which was on the edges in both the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.890
 the bottom of the sensor 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.760
 and you're already giving this the joinha in the video 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.950
 emad wheels 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.180
 the two parts together and testing the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.709
 Our order is working. 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.390
 correctly going up and down 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.160
 freely 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.190
 if it is stuck with the motion 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.440
 going up normal but the claw bc do 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.419
 small twists in that little finger until 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.870
 stay in a position where it rises and 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.450
 descend freely to glue the two 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.200
 shares using super bonder other 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.200
 similar tail 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.690
 the purpose of the previous test 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.169
 And now that we are going to return it to the 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.169
 your original location 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:27.820
 this place is circled place and 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:29.950
 See I've put it in now I'm 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.240
 putting connector back check if 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.240
 everything is fine, trapped 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.600
 That's it folks the sprinter is 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.490
 working again 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.539
 if you still do not like it down there 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.120
 enjoy the video 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.370
 I enjoy also subscribing to the channel 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.229
 if the forum is part of the group 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.880
 of mechanics share this video 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.120
 also popular so that we can help 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.650
 other people 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.669
 this was another tutorial of life and even 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.669
 the next staff
