00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
clan members I was actually in this game

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
clan members I was actually in this game
with<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.160> gazelle<00:02:05.520> while<00:02:05.850> he<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.480> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
with a gazelle while he got it and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.800 
with a gazelle while he got it and
actually<00:02:07.590> came<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.330> complete<00:02:09.330> shock<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
actually came to a complete shock I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470 
actually came to a complete shock I
didn't<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.350> anyone<00:02:11.160> had<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.640> Moab<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.180> mean<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
didn't know anyone had the Moab I mean I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240 
didn't know anyone had the Moab I mean I
didn't<00:02:12.690> even<00:02:12.840> pay<00:02:12.990> attention<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.620> seem<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.130> I

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
didn't even pay attention in seem like I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.760 
didn't even pay attention in seem like I
didn't<00:02:14.520> guess<00:02:15.240> look<00:02:15.720> at<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> kill<00:02:16.110> feed<00:02:16.410> and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
didn't guess look at the kill feed and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.740 
didn't guess look at the kill feed and
notice<00:02:17.550> someone's<00:02:17.850> getting<00:02:18.060> massive<00:02:18.450> kills

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
notice someone's getting massive kills

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.470 
notice someone's getting massive kills
or<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.459> anything<00:02:20.850> like<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
or you know anything like that and I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
or you know anything like that and I
think<00:02:21.510> he<00:02:21.750> calls<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.110> around<00:02:22.410> 90<00:02:22.920> points<00:02:23.160> there

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
think he calls it around 90 points there

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.020 
think he calls it around 90 points there
are<00:02:23.850> 90<00:02:24.120> some<00:02:24.300> points<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.780> domination<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> it's

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
are 90 some points on domination so it's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.330 
are 90 some points on domination so it's
fairly<00:02:27.270> quick<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> lot<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:30.920> Moab's<00:02:31.920> on

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.210 
fairly quick I do see a lot of Moab's on
smaller<00:02:32.880> maps<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.560> said<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.830> free

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
little hate because of this part but

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.370 
little hate because of this part but
completely<00:02:55.410> understandable<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.370> he<00:02:56.400> was

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
completely understandable that he was

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.479 
completely understandable that he was
probably<00:02:58.380> getting<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> little<00:02:58.830> nervous<00:02:59.040> and

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
probably getting a little nervous and

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.060 
probably getting a little nervous and
didn't<00:03:00.209> want<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.450> get<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> Moab<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.500> know<00:03:01.620> how

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
I figured he was one or two kills way of

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.539 
I figured he was one or two kills way of
hitting<00:03:03.989> those<00:03:04.410> three<00:03:04.709> kills<00:03:04.950> away<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.430> you
