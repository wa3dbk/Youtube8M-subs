00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
first let's get to the lava so um

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.730 
first let's get to the lava so um
loved-up<00:00:16.260> may<00:00:16.770> spread<00:00:17.130> living<00:00:17.609> slowly<00:00:18.029> so

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
loved-up may spread living slowly so

after this i'll be going towards the
water<00:00:21.779> source<00:00:22.189> because<00:00:23.189> some<00:00:23.490> some<00:00:24.119> water<00:00:24.500> may

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
water source because some some water may

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
water source because some some water may
spray<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.010> bit<00:00:26.220> faster<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.359> let's<00:00:27.660> get

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
test run for fun so let's see we can use

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.750 
test run for fun so let's see we can use
these<00:01:01.920> two<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:03.559> stones<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.250> let's<00:01:05.489> break

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
these two into stones so let's break

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.830

that thing there we go and here goes to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.890 
that thing there we go and here goes to
the<00:01:09.960> water<00:01:10.170> source<00:01:11.119> alright<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.330> spreading

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the water source alright is spreading

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
the water source alright is spreading
this<00:01:13.880> all<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.030> let's<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:16.080> over<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
time with you all right let us spread

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.870 
time with you all right let us spread
huh<00:03:20.490> water<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.420> goes<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> little<00:03:21.810> bit<00:03:21.990> faster<00:03:22.880> so

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
huh water it goes a little bit faster so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.630 
huh water it goes a little bit faster so
let's<00:03:24.360> transfer<00:03:24.930> them<00:03:25.170> into<00:03:25.320> stones<00:03:28.640> all

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
let's transfer them into stones all

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.520 
let's transfer them into stones all
right<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.460> formula<00:03:32.460> into<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.910> wall<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.600> wall

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
right it is a formula into a wall a wall

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.830 
right it is a formula into a wall a wall
of<00:03:34.800> stones<00:03:35.810> except<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.960> not<00:03:37.170> obsidian<00:03:37.620> or

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
of stones except is not obsidian or

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.190 
of stones except is not obsidian or
anything<00:03:39.840> like<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.030> grass<00:03:42.480> has<00:03:42.930> no

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
anything like that now the grass has no

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.440 
anything like that now the grass has no
sunlight<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.460> now<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.270> turns<00:03:45.570> into<00:03:46.010> dirt

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
sunlight with it now it turns into dirt

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:55.010 
sunlight with it now it turns into dirt
so<00:03:48.450> that's<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.530> little<00:03:49.710> bit<00:03:50.330> less<00:03:51.350> disaster<00:03:54.020> all

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
so that's a little bit less disaster all

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.670 
so that's a little bit less disaster all
right<00:03:55.320> here<00:03:55.980> we<00:03:56.010> are<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.730> top<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.450> wall<00:03:57.840> the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
right here we are on top of the wall the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.940 
right here we are on top of the wall the
stone<00:03:58.980> wall<00:03:59.280> that<00:04:00.180> I'm<00:04:00.330> standing<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.800> is

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
stone wall that I'm standing and this is

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.250 
stone wall that I'm standing and this is
on<00:04:02.100> top<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.490> world<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.030> should<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:04.020> I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
on top of the world I should know I

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.890 
on top of the world I should know I
can't<00:04:04.620> get<00:04:04.950> further<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.940> we<00:04:05.970> here<00:04:06.420> at<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.660> love

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
can't get further so we here at the love

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.660 
can't get further so we here at the love
of<00:04:07.050> sea<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:08.280> ocean<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.330> let's<00:04:10.459> see<00:04:11.459> we

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
of sea and the ocean so let's see we

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.870 
of sea and the ocean so let's see we
could<00:04:11.850> go<00:04:11.970> dive<00:04:12.240> down<00:04:12.540> take<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.320> look<00:04:13.500> around

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
could go dive down take a look around

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.860 
could go dive down take a look around
under<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.030> water<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:17.270> think<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.600> leaves

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
under the water so I think the leaves

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.830 
under the water so I think the leaves
are<00:04:19.170> still<00:04:19.560> stable<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:21.090> can<00:04:21.299> see<00:04:21.480> through

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
are still stable and I can see through

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.100 
are still stable and I can see through
their<00:04:22.590> lovers<00:04:23.310> still<00:04:24.210> there

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
their lovers still there

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.330 
their lovers still there
which<00:04:25.740> they<00:04:26.550> cannot<00:04:26.879> be<00:04:27.030> burned<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:31.340> yeah

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
which they cannot be burned so yeah

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.749 
which they cannot be burned so yeah
that's<00:04:32.669> pretty<00:04:33.150> much<00:04:33.810> about<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.639> so<00:04:36.050> now<00:04:37.759> this

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
that's pretty much about it so now this

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.610 
that's pretty much about it so now this
is<00:04:38.819> what<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:40.680> stone<00:04:41.009> wall<00:04:41.310> looks<00:04:41.639> like

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
is what the the stone wall looks like

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.709 
is what the the stone wall looks like
actually<00:04:43.620> no<00:04:43.650> it's<00:04:44.219> a<00:04:45.530> quite<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> bit<00:04:46.949> form<00:04:47.719> but

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
actually no it's a quite a bit form but

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.140 
actually no it's a quite a bit form but
not<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.139> much<00:04:49.349> form<00:04:49.740> I<00:04:50.069> thought<00:04:50.610> there<00:04:51.030> would

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
not that much form I thought there would

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.529 
not that much form I thought there would
be<00:04:51.180> like<00:04:51.509> couple<00:04:52.080> stones<00:04:52.319> or<00:04:52.710> any<00:04:53.069> like<00:04:53.539> most

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
be like couple stones or any like most

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.709 
be like couple stones or any like most
of<00:04:54.689> the<00:04:54.780> sybian<00:04:55.409> walls<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.460> would<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.759> like

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
of the sybian walls that would be like

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:02.260 
of the sybian walls that would be like
that<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.620> let's<00:04:58.830> just<00:04:59.009> get<00:04:59.189> out<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.879> so
