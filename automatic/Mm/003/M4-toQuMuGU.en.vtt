00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.359
 Today in this video I am going to teach you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.000
 throw our hair 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.920
 I have washed my head and I have dried 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 well just as with drying in a little 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.619
 ok and then let it air dry 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.200
 Well, as you can see, I have super hair 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 crisp comfortable volume without form nor 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.130
 nothing I have very dry hair is worth and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.149
 very thick and curly as it is very 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.029
 difficult to style 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.160
 Well, I'm going to teach my tricks to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.230
 that you see how to iron our 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.470
 hair it'll teach you what 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.590
 we will need mainly 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.380
 would be a hair iron this is a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.930
 ghd is one of the best investments 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.090
 that I have made is ceramic and the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.100
 true that for my hair is the only thing that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 I found that it really got me ready 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.300
 and it lasts a lot also we are going to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.450
 need a brush or comb to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.540
 untangle our hair worth a comb 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.800
 more barbed peppers so be more 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 together you see to later help smooth it 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.270
 we will also need tweezers to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.170
 help pick our hair can 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 be these more finite or these 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.400
 others the one that best serves you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 OK 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.869
 then also very important I always 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.820
 use before ironing the hair a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.710
 protector for the heat because what 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 It protects a lot and I've noticed that 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 really if you notice the effects are worth 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.710
 because it takes care of the heat of the hair 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.080
 Well, to begin with we are going to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.380
 untangle our hair from the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.659
 points up is worth once what 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.460
 let's have good whole disinherited 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.299
 let's apply the heat protector 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.400
 so we use all the hair a 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 little bit especially with the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.530
 tips that is what the most damaged 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.979
 usually always and what most 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.080
 it causes damage to the good heat for now 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.090
 so we extend the heat protector 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.759
 for all the hair and we hope some 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.060
 little minutes to dry wait and go 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.060
 OK 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.240
 well then when we have already the hair 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.390
 dry let's go back to unravel another 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.510
 Once you want, we comb it a little and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.100
 Now let's separate with the tweezers 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.610
 partitions I hope you see it well 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.720
 let's separate a partition from below 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.600
 from the ears 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.510
 from here more or less to the other 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.390
 Separate with your fingers or with a comb 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.960
 well down and the whole part is of 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.480
 up we will pick it up with a clamp 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.340
 If you do not have one, you can split this 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.340
 up here in two and hold with two 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.170
 tweezers as best we can come good 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.530
 well, the partition that we have made here 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.600
 down we make some stripes in the middle and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.060
 we pulled our hair forward now 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.820
 we will take with the east comb of thorns 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.860
 that I have told you and we will return to 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.780
 combing well so that it is very well 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.630
 combing and ironing what's left 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.360
 totally smooth 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.210
 we plug our hair iron and 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.270
 let's go pulling up here from 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.400
 the root we hook and tighten well and 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.800
 we are combing down at the same time 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.410
 we are doing our iron 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.990
 I go a little bit slowly because 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.610
 I have very difficult hair but good 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.040
 I advise that in the tips not and if 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.140
 you are too much because in the end you 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.870
 punishes a lot 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.880
 we do like this and we must continue doing what 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.100
 same with the other party will continue to do 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.860
 partitions and keep casting towards 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.840
 go ahead and ironing equally I continue 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.840
 ironing my hair and alauÃ­ is not worth 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.380
 very well, as you can see, I've been ironed 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.380
 all hair equals worth following 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.750
 millionth of a finger two of fat and 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.120
 sliding the iron down all 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.600
 like the only thing that the part of here 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.760
 up well with bangs I always have 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.860
 to do for one side I do it for 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.170
 forward prisoner for bust if you want the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.320
 line to the side you will make them to one side 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.280
 and towards another one, I do like this and I usually 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.690
 throw back combing my life 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.160
 open the wheel alone 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.930
 Well, as you can also check 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.870
 is going to be a few two little cousins 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.020
 I lifted well as to that what 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.300
 use is a little bit of zero well because 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.810
 I have very dry hair too if you have 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.480
 the oily hair because you can use serum 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.760
 but the tips are worth because if not 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.500
 right away it would get dirty around here 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.510
 done a little bit above very little 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.720
 I can afford it because I tell you that 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.670
 I have very dry hair you see good 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.860
 I think you notice the difference with the 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.930
 hair fully ironed and ready 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.870
 Well I hope you try it because it's very 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.870
 easy I hope you liked goodbye
