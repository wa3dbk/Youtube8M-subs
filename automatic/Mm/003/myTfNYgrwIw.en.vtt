00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.100 

until<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.190> see<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.520> break

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.320 

I<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.830> better<00:03:14.040> herself

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.210 

if<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.900> control<00:03:20.290> which<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.770> have<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:20.950> good

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
if you control which and have a good

if you control which and have a good
steady<00:03:21.610> hand<00:03:22.920> you'll<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:24.070> alright

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.920 

all<00:03:40.340> right<00:03:40.490> let's<00:03:40.730> see<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.970> art<00:03:41.150> there<00:03:41.330> I'll

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930

all right let's see the art there I'll
have<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.170> little<00:03:43.630> hint<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.870> black<00:03:45.200> steel<00:03:45.620> around

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.600 
it
so<00:03:47.150> after<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:47.600> dries<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:48.910> little<00:03:49.910> bit<00:03:51.610> done

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
so after this dries a little bit done

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.370 
so after this dries a little bit done
art<00:03:52.940> turned<00:03:53.150> out<00:03:53.300> perfect<00:03:53.750> better<00:03:53.960> than<00:03:54.200> this
