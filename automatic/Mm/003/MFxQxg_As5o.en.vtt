likely<00:03:41.659> Wiggles<00:03:41.989> was<00:03:42.170> born<00:03:42.439> with<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.680> genetic

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
likely Wiggles was born with a genetic

likely Wiggles was born with a genetic
defect<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.760> affects<00:03:44.209> his<00:03:44.599> neurological

so<00:03:48.769> Mike<00:03:48.980> gives<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.400> go-ahead<00:03:49.579> for<00:03:50.000> adoption

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
so Mike gives the go-ahead for adoption

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.440 
so Mike gives the go-ahead for adoption
I<00:03:50.769> think<00:03:51.769> what<00:03:51.980> he<00:03:52.069> has<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.879> gonna<00:03:53.269> be<00:03:53.390> a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
I think what he has is gonna be a

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.250 
I think what he has is gonna be a
permanent<00:03:54.049> issue<00:03:54.590> with<00:03:54.920> him<00:03:55.159> but<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:57.049> goal

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
permanent issue with him but the goal

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.619 
permanent issue with him but the goal
will<00:03:57.409> be<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.680> he<00:03:57.769> can<00:03:57.920> learn<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.579> cope<00:03:59.060> with

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
will be that he can learn to cope with

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.520 
will be that he can learn to cope with
what<00:03:59.840> he<00:03:59.930> has<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.560> adjust<00:04:01.189> accordingly

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
what he has and adjust accordingly
