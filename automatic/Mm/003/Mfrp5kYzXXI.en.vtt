skyline<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:26.130> this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
skyline like this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.480 
skyline like this
see<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.160> looks<00:02:29.370> pretty<00:02:29.460> good<00:02:29.910> at<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.420> oh<00:02:31.490> so

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
see it looks pretty good at that oh so

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.000 
see it looks pretty good at that oh so
yeah<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.110> not<00:02:34.290> really<00:02:34.530> impact

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
yeah it will not really impact

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.370 
yeah it will not really impact
performance<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.850> much<00:02:37.610> because<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
performance that much because when you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500 
performance that much because when you
open<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.470> tap<00:02:40.770> open<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> window<00:02:41.550> for<00:02:41.790> example<00:02:42.300> and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
open a tap open a window for example and

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.830 
open a tap open a window for example and
you<00:02:42.630> go<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:43.080> back<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.820> actually<00:02:45.030> pauses

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
you go like back here it actually pauses

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.650 
you go like back here it actually pauses
the<00:02:46.170> video<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.370> won't<00:02:47.910> take<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> lot<00:02:48.390> of
