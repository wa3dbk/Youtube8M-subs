00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:17.630
 songs from a cd and save a mp3 format 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.630
 our computer 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.520
 I'm going to insert a music cd in my 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.520
 computer 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:41.360

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:48.379

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:52.299

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.030
 posteriorly 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.080
 So how will we transform these 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.450
 songs in mp3 files that will be 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.940
 available on your computer and 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:20.439
 later you can switch to the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.439
 33 or recorded on a cd in mp3 format 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.210
 For this we need a program and 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:39.770
 now we will do the research of the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:44.240
 program is called if and search for 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:53.150

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:57.230

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:42.640
 this milk program to install there is 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.050
 very easy is not accurate 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.239
 some details not to install in 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.930
 unnecessary things for example 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.930
 those bars 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.700
 these two options 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.480
 We do not want this beach bar. 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.480
 another option 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.920
 let's wait 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:20.489
 I will leave this option as soon as the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.489
 program 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:35.260
 you can close this open window and it 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:39.129
 found my audio CD that I 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:46.860
 I put it in the ac / dc driver for improvement 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:46.860
 window that is a cd 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.980
 I'm going to take a test now unmarked. 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:04:05.440
 all tracks here leave only 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:09.609
 a marked track and now we will 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.549
 convert this song with just one 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:16.209
 selected music to perform the test 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:21.389
 you're going to stay right and choose and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.389
 for selected tracks for mp3 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.760
 wait until the end of the process 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:48.600
 As soon as the process is finished, open the 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:54.720
 bare window in the place where the music was 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:05:00.390
 Only he plays on the desktop. 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:05.780
 so I 'll select the file from 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.780
 audio that is in mp3 format 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.560

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.020
