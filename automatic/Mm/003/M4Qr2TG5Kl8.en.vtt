00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.140
 good only here the battery of the fusca 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.420
 from my little fuck 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.310
 here my situation is down from my bank 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.129
 obama wanted to stay 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.240
 the year 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.380
 the voltage regulator all 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.380
 this way not much 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.900
 - I had talked to victims of what I said 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.239
 when he gets here 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.779
 he arrives in cac 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.060
 He wants to get here. He's still undefeated. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.159
 a part goes pro 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.579
 a part goes to the rear of the car when you have a device passed 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.800
 the rear lights 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 a piece of him that's actually coming 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.500
 of the dynamo but is passing here inside to come pro 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.430
 regulator 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.160
 I hear there, I show it here. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 explains that the provider of the adept down here 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.780
 and the rest to the post of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.180
 is the battery gun cable 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.340
 queta that this crisis much thicker clicked promoter of events 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.980
 Ok I've been in the very interesting process here. 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.370
 I've been here that is a bit more difficult. 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.539
 it's on at the same point here 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.890
 where does that red cross car come from? 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.140
 who comes here 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 and go there pro 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 into the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 So 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.380
 Any nice text for you to do if you want to stay 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.680
 leaves the medical part of the beetle ladybug 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.240
 a chain scale I already told you about it 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.550
 helton has assumed that you already know how to use a common team because I have videos 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.150
 about it - will make you lose the key of the institution's safe 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.140
 will the ignition key 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 will shut off another three years in fall 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.200
 in an investigation we can not take advantage of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 nobody 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 will leave the delivery of the presents in the plenary 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.950
 Mario Dagogo 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.270
 then the consumption due to tel 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.920
 It has to be practically zero 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.360
 because they ate at 0 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 the probable case of al-ain 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.820
 it is possible to consult 0 points and russia 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.210
 o with 200 mi the client can not be charged 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.869
 from north on natal this gives a mood with anac to 0 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.830
 So how are you going to find out my helmet came from? 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.199
 but imagine that you are downloading the battery 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.240
 this is the first test you will do with the car 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.710
 with all this legacy 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.340
 has 0 01 drop and 0 is here giving a little bit 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.040
 The problem is that just as kinect works 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.019
 because even on the scale of 2012 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.019
 He keeps on giving a change. 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.519
 so I will keep 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.280
 he scale of 20 kg is dealing with a current relative to pec 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.849
 The most you cqc 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.559
 pay attention to what I'm going to say and try to play 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.559
 you notice that you have high consumption of comment here 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:56.239
 for example 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.999
 like this 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.619
 What I did, I called again, Veronica. 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:01.869
 the malapata 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.519
 from inside the car 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.919
 dropped pum 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.769
 the sentinel perez or 0 photo 80 meliantes 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.239
 or 0 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.569
 another item that does not 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.699
 with PÃ©rez 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.419
 then this consumption or consumption of that mine 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.639
 will it be that consumption per captures and records 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.519
 low voltage 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.160
 It's okay then if you put everything off 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.069
 battery runs out quickly 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.589
 what do you need to do 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.959
 You need to get laughter out of here and see if you do not have one. 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.589
 lamp on has nothing 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.219
 What's the first thing I'm going to tell you to do? 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.849
 the first thing 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.170
 We removed fuses from the fuse box 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.089
 You can have them all. 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.829
 understand and take one at a time 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.680
 starts with a carriel dropped consumption due to not shooting second fall 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.489
 I do not want to weave 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.199
 and so on 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.439
 never going to remove any of the fuses, the problem is that before 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.619
 fuse box 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.039
 which would be part of stakes and rifles 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.449
 there were in the lights the order suddenly the ignition key 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.329
 Suddenly some problem that I'm going to love too 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.070
 There you go, hanging up. 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.639
 but you go through the possible the easiest thing 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.779
 then just to illustrate if you took a fuse for example from the headlight 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.129
 I'll call you flashlights. 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.229
 poster 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.229
 only to laterna the latino consumption said 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:20.829
 two aspects 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.219
 why did the negative sign appear here? 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.409
 being that 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.240
 being that should eat step is similar 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.280
 I want to say here 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.340
 pointed out the team defeated calling her out of the authorized standard 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.470
 and you fancy 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.229
 to the consumer as a result of 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.349
 soup 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.550
 for convenience that put it opposite if the interface 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.740
 this is the candidate to show that we are training 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.559
 other 20 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.559
 but no goal 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.069
 it's already the consumption of honey 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.050
 from my company person 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.050
 now the consumption of honey 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.419
 to the bar 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.720
 along with the flashlight 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.800
 of the consumer 11 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.539
 of the consumer the burden o pt claims the paulinho in the car 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.889
 Nothing has changed 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.259
 the course 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.259
 lost almost everything right he just wanted 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.099
 It's good, the ideal is to consume little 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.389
 in the document 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.389
 now it consumes little 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.249
 now I'm going to throw the ignition key 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.860
 lajir ex-cleaning machine key of the ignition 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.990
 This leaves the beginning. 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.990
 Our country is the leader. 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.229
 just turn the key in the ignition 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.629
 increases to 17 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.699
 we never went very well 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.699
 already in the trophy to say this subject of abuse in nothing 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.719
 so it's easy there 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.949
 if you identify where the current is to escape before turning to the 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.889
 movie theater 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.699
 It's easy for you to identify 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.849
 where the color is running 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:15.139
 me and 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.939
 Tart with strong chain 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:18.610
 starts there taking away the 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.719
 the fossils 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.629
 This is true for any car, it's not worth deep. 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.860
 this ps and psd the current form 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.430
 or with a more complex electrical part that overshadowed the fact that the 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.119
 but those who have can give you a little work 

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.839
 I do not play the very simple play with today's standards a pack of 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.069
 job 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.009
 and it's a modern all-electronic car there 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:40.949
 If you have an electrical problem, you can 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:42.990
 with the modern one and that is the flagship 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.539
 death occurred 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.680
 because it is very complicated in the sense of campinas 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.610
 will stay every time he passes the principle he 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.430
 and how are you? 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.729
 to detect a current leakage 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.729
 but the electrical part in day 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.029
 the last athlete to retire 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.029
 if you have any 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.300
 from that game 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.229
 from that fuse on 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.259
 from phones onwards what you can do 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.279
 you can follow let's assume it's the cable 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.309
 low beam headlamp 

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:26.719
 you look like the cable to see where you are going 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:29.990
 m this is very common a passing car and workshops 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.839
 and the weight of the workshop 

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:33.479
 it was not he was a painter 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.309
 they do not like to touch the side and make a 

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:40.149
 Sometimes it's a butcher 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:42.979
 we disagree and 4th place to ride 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.589
 at the close of the armed conflict 

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:47.550
 fisichella 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.780
 understood then depends on the service you will see poorly done there fox is a 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.340
 aggravating
