00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.200
 this is where his note richard have made a 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.090
 single posture for the summer to make yourself 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.470
 you'll see it's very very strong then 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.349
 I start by cutting by year I 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.970
 cut in half I remove the membranes to 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.280
 inside the questions you want it 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.770
 comment on a small cube stopped 1 cm 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.750
 on 20 cm it's really we are really 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.029
 on a salad we have all the products of 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.350
 summer is super simple to live in 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.859
 they are ripe they are clean 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.929
 the pretty kubina any mix here 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.579
 tamas and that's what it's like a story like 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.710
 you did once we attacked the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.569
 cucumber then understand it we're going to 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.249
 cut in half you keep 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:42.620
 the skin is full of vitamins and 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.389
 fact that is little digestible on the big 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.190
 it's mostly the glitches then the 

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:48.319
 glitches us when the shots are going to go 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.539
 remove if the knife cuts it is done 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.069
 all alone is enough to eat you it's 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.690
 mark the link via lines 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:58.850
 as coloring we follow the quiet 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.959
 during the summer and at the commune the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.549
 cucumber is pretty big we are going to 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:05.260
 cut in half will not kill near the same 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.010
 size that's it ok so after 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.040
 the idea is to really have the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.330
 freshness of the legos I can start the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820
 tomatoes two breakouts 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.580
 so I got scared of beef we take off 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.970
 a little bit the peduncle is exactly 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.590
 the same 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.770
 beef hearts and are not very 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.890
 rich in beta so we're lucky in 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.720
 cut it in big slice our tomatoes 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.360
 without cutting we add in a 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.770
 bowl 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:38.570
 this is my client wants everything is 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.970
 simple that would be nice but not 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.159
 this scene is important because the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.240
 daniel cubes worth a small centimeter 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.950
 that if his cutting edge with 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.510
 the seasoning they crave spit out 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.680
 water and will soften the dcri will require 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.180
 really from the massonne flush the side 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.070
 freshness to talk again all the hurry 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.850
 christophe a little oil vinaigrette 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.550
 olive cider vinegar with vinegar 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.740
 wine okay you're going to prepare there this 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.230
 once I'm going to cut black olive all 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.509
 simple 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:10.250
 and we will cut them while we enjoyed good 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.260
 on the turn it will bring color 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.520
 know how to bring sometimes and especially 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.590
 not in the middle because communion with the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.990
 fairy table so the feta we take care of it 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.070
 find a small piece and we see the 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.180
 grated so we said that these salads 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.920
 summer but their business winter we're going 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.730
 to make the snow party goers who brought 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.770
 the hand group on it 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.110
 gold with already a little bit of flat parsley 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.920
 which will progress quickly 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.020
 then we are a dash of olive oil 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.209
 to finish the salad is beautiful 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.430
 christophe that's all brings us in 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.700
 holiday a work of art no but it's 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.140
 true here is finished parsley to apple 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.400
 people cut off a minute a little 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.190
 vinaigrette or ludo lille can be 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.410
 put some vinaigrette and 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.620
 table it's over you have this 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.390
 recipe it's fresh it's simple then 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.280
 the horror is the very very greedy 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.489
 it's summer enjoy it to you 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.489
