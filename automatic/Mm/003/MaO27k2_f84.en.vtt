berry bushes and perennial vegetables so

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.090 
berry bushes and perennial vegetables so
and<00:00:18.300> then<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.660> mushroom<00:00:19.350> patches<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and then we use mushroom patches to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.090 
and then we use mushroom patches to
increase<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.760> fertility<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.900> soil<00:00:22.100> so

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
increase the fertility in the soil so

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:38.720 
increase the fertility in the soil so
the<00:00:23.310> plants<00:00:23.670> grow<00:00:23.820> better

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.310 
older woodchips up two feet by 10 feet
and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.470> we<00:02:43.470> covered<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.010> with<00:02:45.320> spawn

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
and then we covered it with spawn

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.730 
and then we covered it with spawn
mushroom<00:02:46.890> spawn<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:48.170> then<00:02:49.170> covered<00:02:49.590> that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
mushroom spawn and then covered that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.800 
mushroom spawn and then covered that
with<00:02:50.010> alder<00:02:50.880> wood<00:02:51.060> chips<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:54.390> happens

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
with alder wood chips and this happens

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.420 
with alder wood chips and this happens

to be nameko mushroom that often we

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.880 
to be nameko mushroom that often we
usually<00:02:59.760> use<00:02:59.940> el<00:03:00.239> moister<00:03:00.720> or

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
a pearl oyster and this is what happened

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.730 
a pearl oyster and this is what happened
this<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:07.400> early<00:03:08.400> November<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:12.740> mushroom

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
this is early November and the mushroom

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.480 
this is early November and the mushroom
patch<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.250> just<00:03:14.459> spilling<00:03:14.880> out<00:03:15.240> mushrooms<00:03:16.490> so

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
patch is just spilling out mushrooms so

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.090 
patch is just spilling out mushrooms so
what<00:03:17.640> it's<00:03:17.790> done<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.270> it's<00:03:18.750> creating<00:03:19.110> mycelial

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
what it's done is it's creating mycelial

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.850 
what it's done is it's creating mycelial
Network<00:03:20.490> underneath<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:22.410> made<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
soils healthy enough to make all these

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.550 
soils healthy enough to make all these
