this is what the back looks like this is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.870 
this is what the back looks like this is
the<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.990> Samsung<00:01:13.500> Galaxy<00:01:14.010> Note<00:01:14.040> 10.1

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the back of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.480 
the back of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
2014<00:01:15.360> edition<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> really<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.369> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
2014 edition and all you really need to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.530 
2014 edition and all you really need to
do<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.560> take<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.100> reconnect<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.909> LCD

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
do is take out and reconnect the LCD

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.100 
do is take out and reconnect the LCD
connector<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> LCD<00:01:22.920> connector<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:24.110> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
connector so the LCD connector is the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.109 
connector so the LCD connector is the
one<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.070> battery<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
one with the battery the one with the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.410 
one with the battery the one with the
battery<00:01:27.420> side<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:28.740> says<00:01:29.040> LCD<00:01:29.970> cable

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
battery side and actually says LCD cable

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
battery side and actually says LCD cable
right<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.740> should<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
right over here so that should make it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
right over here so that should make it
way<00:01:32.310> easier<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.390> see<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
way easier for you to see if I the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780 
way easier for you to see if I the
camera<00:01:34.680> angle<00:01:34.950> screw<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> one

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
camera angle screw it up so it's the one

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.670 
camera angle screw it up so it's the one
with<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> battery<00:01:36.329> that's<00:01:36.420> how<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> LCD<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
with the battery that's how the LCD it's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
with the battery that's how the LCD it's
just<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.159> black<00:01:38.640> strip<00:01:39.390> over<00:01:39.630> here
