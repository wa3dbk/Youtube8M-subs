this fresh scratch it can be quite
tricky<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.459> put<00:02:15.000> out<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:16.909> it's<00:02:17.909> it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
tricky to put out because it's it's it's

it's<00:02:19.079> not<00:02:19.349> it's<00:02:20.189> really<00:02:20.459> gooey<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.079> and

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
it's not it's really gooey and and

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.890 
it's not it's really gooey and and
therefore<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.769> you<00:02:23.069> want<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.549> some<00:02:23.900> some

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
therefore you you want to do some some

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.470 
therefore you you want to do some some
tests<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.379> on<00:02:25.650> how<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.030> best

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.780 
I'm just using some tissue just to put
down<00:03:28.660> some<00:03:28.959> yuzu<00:03:29.440> blood<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.980> then<00:03:30.130> wash<00:03:30.760> it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
down some yuzu blood and then wash it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.559 
down some yuzu blood and then wash it
off<00:03:31.150> again<00:03:31.599> just<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:34.120> make<00:03:34.299> it<00:03:34.420> look<00:03:34.510> like

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
off again just to to make it look like

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.069 
off again just to to make it look like
it's<00:03:35.019> it's<00:03:35.440> been<00:03:35.799> messy<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:36.549> I've<00:03:36.700> been<00:03:37.079> been

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
it's it's been messy but I've been been

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.780 
it's it's been messy but I've been been
tearing<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.620> up<00:03:38.739> just<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.459> bit<00:03:39.640> because

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
tearing it up just just a bit because

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.910 
tearing it up just just a bit because
that's<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.660> guess<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.260> what<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.590> would<00:03:41.709> do

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
that's I guess that what you would do

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.580 
that's I guess that what you would do
when<00:03:42.269> when<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.389> would<00:03:43.569> would<00:03:43.959> cut<00:03:44.170> yourself

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
when when you would would cut yourself

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.039 
when when you would would cut yourself
you<00:03:44.799> would<00:03:44.980> try<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:46.269> remove<00:03:46.569> some<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:46.840> the

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
you would try to to remove some of the

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.910 
you would try to to remove some of the
blood<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.859> that's<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.870> just<00:03:49.959> like<00:03:50.470> just

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
blood so that's just it's just like just

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.220 
blood so that's just it's just like just
play<00:03:51.220> with<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.489> just<00:03:51.819> put<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.389> put<00:03:52.690> us<00:03:52.870> put

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
play with it just put on put us put

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.129 
play with it just put on put us put
something<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:54.299> take<00:03:55.299> something<00:03:55.510> off<00:03:55.780> and

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
something on take something off and

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.289 
something on take something off and
that's<00:03:56.889> just<00:03:57.040> how<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.280> will<00:03:57.579> figure<00:03:57.910> out<00:03:58.060> how

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
that's just how you will figure out how

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:10.240 
that's just how you will figure out how
your<00:03:58.510> look<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.870> going<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.260> be

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.730 

basically<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.790> more<00:04:11.970> layers<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.570> can<00:04:12.750> do<00:04:13.170> the

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
basically the more layers you can do the

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.940 
basically the more layers you can do the
blood<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.430> better<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:15.000> will<00:04:15.180> get<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:16.500> so

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
blood in the better it will get so so

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.370 
blood in the better it will get so so
don't<00:04:17.130> rush<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.180> add<00:04:18.810> blood<00:04:19.230> all

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
don't rush in and just add blood all

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.790 
don't rush in and just add blood all
over<00:04:20.090> work<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.239> up<00:04:21.360> slowly<00:04:21.720> work<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.620> room

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800
