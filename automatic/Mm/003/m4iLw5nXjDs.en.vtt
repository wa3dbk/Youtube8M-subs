 You saw well that if you saw well it is 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.280
 the x if you saw according to where you are going to 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.199
 leave and the climate that is for example the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.030
 from the cold I'm seeing that just 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.940
 the cold starts and a lot of people already 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.709
 he looks with his friends long boots and not 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.449
 the days that really see how much pri goes 

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:07.270
 to be for receipt you put on a sweater 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.830
 cited not all the jeans and moss theaters and 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.150
 so it gets colder 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 bundled up on some talking boats 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.000
 it's a little darker 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.180
 the black shoe up shooters blue king 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.610
 green and if it's already hot with terror 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.340
 more short or without other ovens cuts a 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.980
 little bit longer the huaraches t-shirts 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.380
 with prince colorful so much some 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.060
 hat and also girl a lot where 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.520
 you're going to go because for example if it's a 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.590
 wedding if you can see very well very many 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.660
 style and everything but then you do not formalize 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.760
 and from that moment until you no longer see 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.890
 alright then if you go to a wedding for 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.080
 example is a tuxedo that never loses 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.960
 dark colors you can put more 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.000
 color on the shirt in the bow if you want 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.830
 have more proposals are more tight and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.630
 already if it's going to be a more casual place like 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.940
 to the cinema below a meeting put because 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.550
 from elegantly with a shirt the 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.990
 you can fold you can put this same 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.729
 also booties with a pair of trousers 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.729
 Denim or denim 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.810
 as it is said in our country here in 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.480
 mexico usually the boys we 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.450
 we say very basic very basic that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.300
 denim tennis work striped with print or 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.500
 some shirt but I really do not know if 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.150
 there are many but it is because they 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.130
 we say no, well, that's only enough and that's 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.530
 but if you look good there are new 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.270
 new designers proposed through 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.950
 more you have to always get a 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.140
 little beyond the same as always 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.670
 we see and I promise you that if you try 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.070
 new things that socks from 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.290
 colors and good some hat 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.090
 colors of colors other color in the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.130
 canons pants that whites something 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.130
 well but like some blue I do not know what 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.130
 try 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.980
 our basic purpose is whether it is a pair of trousers 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.260
 with some boots a cake and changes 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.599
 over and if you can many others 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.689
 super neutral solar formal media 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.689
 and usually so white or black 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.470
 is what we would do with the clothes of the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.120
 I'm really struck by menchaca who already 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.100
 They had scheduled more feminine clothes 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.020
 of man when you are very parents the 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.930
 true how some saved you have to 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.060
 cloud mainz making hat things yes 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.280
 that is they are very parents projected 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.410
 too much for the feminine and you already lose 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.730
 essence of masculinity that is what 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.350
 more we like menswear the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.240
 true but also to that it hits us 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.070
 vischi much more market with women 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.410
 much more proposal but it is obviously 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.360
 because the masters bring us to use it and therefore 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.910
 It does not sell and I think it starts 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.280
 use it dare more to use more 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.330
 proposals and see if the difference I 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.190
 I think it is expanding a bit of what 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.190
 which is the man's clothing market 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.530
 already to finish we want to invite you and 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.630
 encourage them to use new proposals 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.820
 always they dressed with style and 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.290
 that always gives them security not the 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.760
 we give twitpic here we are going to leave 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.590
