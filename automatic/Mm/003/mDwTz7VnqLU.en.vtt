first thing how these work this is the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.630 
first thing how these work this is the
one<00:00:34.320> inch<00:00:34.469> size<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> appropriate<00:00:35.610> for

I was using them for steelhead but large
stone<00:00:44.250> nests<00:00:44.460> were<00:00:44.579> trying<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.969> good<00:00:45.120> so

flat but it does have threads that comes
off<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.260> factory<00:00:56.100> instructions<00:00:56.809> would

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809

loosen this up a little bit and then I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.690 
loosen this up a little bit and then I
can<00:01:33.450> slide

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
can slide

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
of a cool trick that one of my friends

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.300 
of a cool trick that one of my friends
showed<00:01:53.250> me<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.290> other<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.009> way<00:01:56.159> our

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
showed me so the other way the way our

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
showed me so the other way the way our
guide<00:01:56.520> staff<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:57.000> been<00:01:57.030> rigging<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.719> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
guide staff has been rigging it up is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.109 
guide staff has been rigging it up is
pretty<00:01:58.850> ingenious

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
pretty ingenious

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.780 
pretty ingenious
one<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.899> our<00:02:00.990> friends<00:02:01.229> showed<00:02:01.619> us<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
one of our friends showed us this and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.359 
one of our friends showed us this and
it's<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> help<00:02:03.360> make<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> 90-degree<00:02:04.469> turn

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it's going to help make a 90-degree turn

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.359 
it's going to help make a 90-degree turn
at<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.899> indicator<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.560> what<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> would<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
at the indicator so what I would do is I

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.339 
at the indicator so what I would do is I
would<00:02:08.459> take<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:08.940> whatever<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.899> my<00:02:10.050> fly<00:02:10.319> is

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
would take my whatever and my fly is

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.360 
would take my whatever and my fly is
going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:12.599> would<00:02:12.780> go

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
going to go to and I would go

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.259 
going to go to and I would go
down<00:02:13.549> through<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.860> washer<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:16.640> this<00:02:16.940> and

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
down through the washer like this and

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.610 
down through the washer like this and
actually<00:02:17.390> go<00:02:17.690> through<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.989> middle<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.440> that

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
actually go through the middle of that

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.149 
actually go through the middle of that
so<00:02:19.549> I've<00:02:19.640> threaded<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.390> now<00:02:21.010> now<00:02:22.010> I'm

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
so I've threaded that on now now I'm

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.059 
so I've threaded that on now now I'm
going<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.370> take<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.110> put<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:25.010> like

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
going to take and put this on here like

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.289 
going to take and put this on here like
so<00:02:26.110> still<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> go<00:02:27.379> through<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.739> in

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
so still going to go through that in

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.309 
so still going to go through that in
fact<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.390> don't<00:02:29.450> even<00:02:29.569> really<00:02:29.810> need<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.230> you

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
fact you don't even really need to you

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.619 
fact you don't even really need to you
just<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.709> feel<00:02:30.890> your<00:02:31.040> way<00:02:31.190> through<00:02:31.220> this

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
just kind of feel your way through this

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.460 
just kind of feel your way through this
I'm<00:02:32.629> going<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.930> thread<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.440> back<00:02:33.739> on<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:36.170> so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
I'm going to thread this back on like so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.089 
I'm going to thread this back on like so
and<00:02:37.659> so<00:02:38.659> I've<00:02:38.750> got<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.170> going<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.860> I'm

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
and so I've got that going in I'm

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.059 
and so I've got that going in I'm
threading<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.840> then<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:41.870> ran<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.530> line

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
threading it on then I ran the line

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.199 
threading it on then I ran the line
through<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.700> washer<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.360> what<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.290> does

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
through the washer and what this does

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.849 
through the washer and what this does
creates<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.299> 90-degree<00:02:47.989> turn<00:02:48.019> at<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
creates a 90-degree turn at the

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.670 
creates a 90-degree turn at the
indicator<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:50.090> let's<00:02:50.269> just<00:02:50.480> pretend<00:02:50.680> this

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
indicator so let's just pretend this

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.369 
indicator so let's just pretend this
line<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:52.430> my<00:02:52.579> right<00:02:52.819> hand<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.480> going<00:02:54.109> back

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
line here in my right hand is going back

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.000 
line here in my right hand is going back
towards<00:02:54.799> my<00:02:54.950> fly<00:02:55.220> rod<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:57.769> line

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
towards my fly rod like so this line

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.569 
towards my fly rod like so this line
here<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.519> going<00:02:58.700> down<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.329> my<00:02:59.480> flies<00:02:59.840> like<00:03:00.200> that

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
here is going down to my flies like that

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.979 
here is going down to my flies like that
now<00:03:01.579> this<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.849> going<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.209> actually<00:03:02.629> help<00:03:02.780> my

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
now this is going to actually help my

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.449 
now this is going to actually help my
fly<00:03:03.230> sit<00:03:03.590> directly<00:03:03.890> underneath<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
fly sit directly underneath the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.520 
fly sit directly underneath the
indicator<00:03:05.000> it's<00:03:05.690> going<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.930> help<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.260> sink

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
indicator it's going to help it sink

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.190 
indicator it's going to help it sink
fast<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.159> it<00:03:07.700> makes<00:03:07.909> a<00:03:08.000> 90-degree<00:03:08.569> turn<00:03:08.599> you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
fast and it makes a 90-degree turn you

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.170 
fast and it makes a 90-degree turn you
can<00:03:09.379> do<00:03:09.560> more<00:03:09.769> research<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.310> 90<00:03:10.670> degree<00:03:10.940> nymph

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
can do more research on 90 degree nymph

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.599 
can do more research on 90 degree nymph
setups<00:03:11.599> if<00:03:11.810> you'd<00:03:11.989> like<00:03:12.190> but<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.310> helps<00:03:13.519> to

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
setups if you'd like but it helps to

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.849 
setups if you'd like but it helps to
make<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> 90-degree<00:03:14.180> turn<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.959> gets<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> flies

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
make a 90-degree turn and gets the flies

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.409 
make a 90-degree turn and gets the flies
directly<00:03:16.129> underneath<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.000> indicator

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
directly underneath the indicator

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.770 
directly underneath the indicator
quickly<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.470> since<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:18.950> like<00:03:19.160> that

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
quickly and since it's like that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.300 
quickly and since it's like that
adjusting<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.900> becomes<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.470> same<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:22.040> does

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
adjusting it becomes the same it does

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.099 
adjusting it becomes the same it does
make<00:03:22.519> your<00:03:22.669> leader<00:03:22.880> kink<00:03:23.269> just<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.630> little<00:03:23.900> bit

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
make your leader kink just a little bit

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.460 
make your leader kink just a little bit
that<00:03:24.859> I<00:03:24.950> can<00:03:25.359> loosen<00:03:26.359> it<00:03:26.599> up<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.109> can<00:03:27.290> move

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
that I can loosen it up and I can move

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.640 
that I can loosen it up and I can move
it<00:03:27.620> up<00:03:27.769> my<00:03:27.919> line<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:29.900> tighten<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.500> back

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
it up my line and I just tighten it back

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.379 
it up my line and I just tighten it back
down<00:03:30.709> again<00:03:31.340> like<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.819> I've<00:03:34.970> got<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.239> set

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
down again like so and I've got to set

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.670 
down again like so and I've got to set
up<00:03:35.480> at<00:03:35.599> 90<00:03:35.840> degrees<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:36.349> there's<00:03:36.530> two

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
up at 90 degrees so there's two

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.930 
up at 90 degrees so there's two
different<00:03:36.709> ways<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.099> set<00:03:37.459> up<00:03:37.549> airlock

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
different ways to set up airlock

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.869 
different ways to set up airlock
indicator<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:39.139> I<00:03:39.290> really<00:03:40.250> like<00:03:40.459> them<00:03:40.700> they're

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
indicator and I really like them they're

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.869 
indicator and I really like them they're
the<00:03:41.030> only<00:03:41.419> downside<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:41.989> these<00:03:42.379> is<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:43.250> think

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
the only downside to these is I think

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.610 
the only downside to these is I think
because<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.269> this<00:03:44.510> kind<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:44.930> big<00:03:45.139> knob<00:03:45.379> on

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
probably not going to notice it but I
