true crypt window as much as possible

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.780 
true crypt window as much as possible
this<00:01:43.930> will<00:01:44.110> generate<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.440> random<00:01:44.680> pool<00:01:45.130> which

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
this will generate a random pool which

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.940 
this will generate a random pool which
will<00:01:45.940> make<00:01:46.060> your<00:01:46.180> encryption<00:01:46.540> better<00:01:46.900> just<00:01:47.830> go

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
will make your encryption better just go

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.640 
will make your encryption better just go
ahead<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.190> push<00:01:48.370> format<00:01:49.260> once<00:01:50.260> it's<00:01:50.440> finished

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
ahead and push format once it's finished

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.020

it'll<00:01:50.980> tell<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.550> TrueCrypt<00:01:51.940> volume

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
it'll tell you that the TrueCrypt volume

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.960 
it'll tell you that the TrueCrypt volume
has<00:01:52.450> been<00:01:52.480> successfully<00:01:53.260> created<00:01:53.440> so<00:01:54.340> push<00:01:54.550> ok

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
has been successfully created so push ok

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.860 
has been successfully created so push ok
then<00:01:55.390> push<00:01:55.630> exit<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.260> exit<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:58.420> you're<00:01:58.659> going

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
then push exit and exit now you're going

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.820 
then push exit and exit now you're going
to<00:01:58.960> want<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.110> come<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.500> back<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.680> your

folder<00:02:03.010> and<00:02:03.220> your<00:02:03.730> secret<00:02:04.210> file<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.100> want

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
folder and your secret file now you want

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.080 
folder and your secret file now you want
to<00:02:06.430> open<00:02:06.520> command<00:02:07.030> prompt

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
to open command prompt

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.979 
to open command prompt
and<00:02:10.709> then<00:02:11.709> type<00:02:12.670> your<00:02:12.700> drive<00:02:13.060> letter<00:02:13.389> so<00:02:13.810> this

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
and then type your drive letter so this

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.349 
and then type your drive letter so this
flash<00:02:14.260> drive<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.920> G<00:02:15.129> Drive<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:16.239> we're

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
flash drive is the G Drive so we're

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.569 
flash drive is the G Drive so we're
going<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.599> want<00:02:16.689> to<00:02:16.780> type<00:02:16.959> G<00:02:17.950> :

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
going to want to type G :

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.910 
going to want to type G :
and<00:02:18.760> then<00:02:18.909> enter<00:02:19.299> now<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.930> see<00:02:20.139> we<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.709> G

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
and then enter now you see we have the G

in it so if we plug in the flash drive

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.509 
in it so if we plug in the flash drive
like<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.829> you'll<00:02:56.949> see<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:57.219> looks<00:02:57.400> like

flash drive you love this when you open

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.940 
flash drive you love this when you open

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
if you push one it will mount your

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.590 
if you push one it will mount your
TrueCrypt<00:03:46.800> volume<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.300> it'll<00:03:48.390> ask<00:03:48.480> you

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
TrueCrypt volume and so it'll ask you

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.460 
TrueCrypt volume and so it'll ask you
for<00:03:48.780> your<00:03:48.810> password<00:03:48.990> first<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:51.170> now<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.230> see

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
for your password first and now you see

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.560 
for your password first and now you see
it<00:03:52.560> mounts<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.459> as<00:03:53.670> an<00:03:53.820> entirely<00:03:54.150> separate

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
it mounts it as an entirely separate

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.560 
it mounts it as an entirely separate
hard<00:03:54.780> drive<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.970> looks<00:03:57.120> like<00:03:57.180> an<00:03:57.300> entirely

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
hard drive so it looks like an entirely

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.540 
hard drive so it looks like an entirely
different<00:03:57.690> flash<00:03:58.110> drive<00:03:58.380> here<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:59.130> if<00:03:59.190> we<00:03:59.280> open

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
different flash drive here so if we open

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.949 
different flash drive here so if we open
that<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.790> see<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.030> have<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.150> five<00:04:00.360> megabyte

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
that you see we have a five megabyte

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.280 
that you see we have a five megabyte
thing<00:04:01.260> here<00:04:01.530> now<00:04:01.970> we're<00:04:02.970> going<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.240> do<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.840> put

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
thing here now we're going to do is put

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:12.240 
thing here now we're going to do is put
a<00:04:04.530> secret<00:04:05.400> file<00:04:05.670> in<00:04:05.910> there

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.130 

it's<00:04:13.000> something<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.390> don't<00:04:13.540> want<00:04:13.660> anybody<00:04:13.990> to

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
it's something I don't want anybody to

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.229 
it's something I don't want anybody to
see<00:04:15.000> I'm<00:04:16.000> going<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.239> close<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.480> and<00:04:16.959> then

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
see I'm going to close that and then

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.569 
see I'm going to close that and then
push<00:04:19.239> three<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.320> dismount<00:04:20.859> all<00:04:21.070> TrueCrypt

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
push three to dismount all TrueCrypt

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.180 
push three to dismount all TrueCrypt
volumes<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.380> it'll<00:04:23.380> say<00:04:23.470> operation<00:04:24.070> complete

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
volumes and it'll say operation complete

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.410 
volumes and it'll say operation complete
now<00:04:27.190> if<00:04:27.340> we<00:04:27.430> come<00:04:27.580> back<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.760> computer<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.210> see

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
now if we come back to computer you see

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.610 
now if we come back to computer you see
it<00:04:28.510> looks<00:04:28.660> like<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.900> flash<00:04:29.110> drive<00:04:29.140> spent

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
it looks like that flash drive spent

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.830 
it looks like that flash drive spent
basically<00:04:29.770> removed<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:31.360> now<00:04:31.480> we'll<00:04:31.630> try<00:04:31.750> this

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
basically removed so now we'll try this

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.830 
basically removed so now we'll try this
again<00:04:32.230> just<00:04:35.970> open<00:04:36.970> this<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.390> can<00:04:37.570> see<00:04:37.750> it

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
again just open this you can see it

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.650 
again just open this you can see it
better<00:04:40.320> we'll<00:04:41.320> open<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:42.040> file<00:04:42.370> here<00:04:42.730> type
