review of the OPI original nail and they

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.000 
review of the OPI original nail and they
as<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.510> see<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:10.170> almost<00:00:10.530> finished

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010

as you can see I have almost finished
the<00:00:11.370> bottle<00:00:11.670> I've<00:00:12.179> been<00:00:12.420> using<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.960> note

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
the bottle I've been using this note

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.109 
the bottle I've been using this note
since<00:00:13.940> last<00:00:15.440> November<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.520> haven't<00:00:17.970> been

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
since last November and I haven't been

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.640 
since last November and I haven't been
wearing<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.539> recently<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.949> because<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
wearing it recently just because I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.170 
wearing it recently just because I
haven't<00:00:22.650> actually<00:00:22.890> needed<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.670> nails<00:00:23.880> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
haven't actually needed it on my nails I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.950 
haven't actually needed it on my nails I
think<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:26.430> has<00:00:26.640> improved<00:00:27.150> them<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:27.660> so

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
think that it has improved them a lot so

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.540 
think that it has improved them a lot so
much<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.619> don't<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> wear

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
much so that I don't really have to wear

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
much so that I don't really have to wear
any<00:00:29.820> more<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.390> I've<00:00:30.570> got<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> problem<00:00:31.470> now

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.459 
any more if I've got like a problem now
I<00:00:31.710> keep<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> them<00:00:32.880> split<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.230> put

on a coat and then other than that I
don't<00:00:36.809> really<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.320> need<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:38.340> the

own

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.420 
own
I<00:01:02.670> think<00:01:03.149> retails<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.930> around<00:01:04.199> about<00:01:04.710> 15

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
I think retails for around about 15

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.300 
I think retails for around about 15
pounds<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.960> go<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:08.570> QVC<00:01:09.570> UK<00:01:10.049> comm<00:01:10.530> base

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
pounds but if you go on QVC UK comm base

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270 
pounds but if you go on QVC UK comm base
always<00:01:11.760> had<00:01:12.119> deals<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:13.049> OPI<00:01:13.619> where<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.010> can

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
always had deals with OPI where you can

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
always had deals with OPI where you can
probably<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.090> 450<00:01:15.630> pounds<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:16.080> something

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
probably get to 450 pounds or something

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.990 
probably get to 450 pounds or something
like<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:18.229> now<00:01:19.229> 15<00:01:19.740> pounds<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> lot<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
like that now 15 pounds is a lot of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
like that now 15 pounds is a lot of
money<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.479> pay<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.290> strength<00:01:22.619> for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
money to pay for an out strength for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.469 
money to pay for an out strength for
that<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.250> also<00:01:23.430> sell<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.090> Boots<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that they also sell this in Boots and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
that they also sell this in Boots and
it's<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:25.110> 15<00:01:25.439> pounds<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.799> there<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.159> he

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it's around 15 pounds in there so if he

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.890 
it's around 15 pounds in there so if he
was<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.840> get<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:29.509> think<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.750> it's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
was going to get it I think that it's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
was going to get it I think that it's
worth<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.320> money<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.820> my

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
worth the money and that's just my

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.149 
worth the money and that's just my
opinion<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.630> oh<00:01:34.079> you've<00:01:34.560> never<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:35.070> had

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
opinion and oh you've never really had

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.569 
opinion and oh you've never really had
like<00:01:35.460> bad<00:01:35.759> problem<00:01:36.360> nails<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
like bad problem nails but there was a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.510 
like bad problem nails but there was a
point<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.799> last<00:01:40.799> year<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> year<00:01:41.369> before

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
point like last year and the year before

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
point like last year and the year before
I<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:42.150> paint<00:01:42.540> my<00:01:42.720> nails<00:01:42.750> every<00:01:43.680> single<00:01:44.040> day

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
I would paint my nails every single day

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.319 
I would paint my nails every single day
and<00:01:45.350> like<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> different<00:01:46.829> color<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.670> take<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and like a different color and I take it

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.730 
and like a different color and I take it
off<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.570> acetone<00:01:49.049> remover<00:01:49.439> which<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
off with acetone remover which is

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.969 
off with acetone remover which is
obviously<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.280> good<00:01:50.430> P<00:01:50.610> nails<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.500> they

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
obviously not good P nails but so they

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.810 
obviously not good P nails but so they
got<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:53.850> dry<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.299> flaky<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.820> but

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
got really really dry and flaky and but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
got really really dry and flaky and but
even<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.990> let<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> week<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
even then if I let them for a week that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.300 
even then if I let them for a week that
go<00:01:59.040> back<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.490> normal<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.979> I've<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.159> always

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
go back to normal and I've just always

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.480 
go back to normal and I've just always
had<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:03.000> good<00:02:03.119> nails<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.590> did<00:02:05.219> start

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
had really good nails but I did start

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.550 
had really good nails but I did start
using<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.329> because<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.869> couple<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.439> my

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
using this just because a couple of my

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.010 
using this just because a couple of my
nails<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:08.129> beyond<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.330> know<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.720> could

expensive and I didn't know what to
expect<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.870> wanted<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.230> try<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.470> nail

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
thinking into the Nile which I

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.150 
thinking into the Nile which I
understand<00:06:34.200> because<00:06:34.380> it<00:06:34.650> is<00:06:34.800> a<00:06:34.830> nail

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
understand because it is a nail

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.110 
understand because it is a nail
treatment<00:06:35.820> but<00:06:36.540> I<00:06:36.840> just<00:06:37.590> don't<00:06:37.830> get<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.190> court

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
treatment but I just don't get the court

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.360 
treatment but I just don't get the court
the<00:06:39.210> treatments<00:06:39.720> don't<00:06:39.750> mix<00:06:40.080> together<00:06:40.370> so

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
the treatments don't mix together so

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.040 
the treatments don't mix together so
yeah<00:06:41.520> I<00:06:41.699> would<00:06:41.760> fully<00:06:42.150> recommend<00:06:42.330> this<00:06:42.810> one

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
yeah I would fully recommend this one

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.390 
yeah I would fully recommend this one
they<00:06:43.199> also<00:06:43.320> do<00:06:43.560> a<00:06:43.590> matte<00:06:43.889> version<00:06:44.220> No<00:06:44.790> and

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
they also do a matte version No and

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.010 
they also do a matte version No and
whenever<00:06:47.400> I've<00:06:47.790> watched<00:06:48.090> someone<00:06:48.540> talking

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
whenever I've watched someone talking

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.040 
whenever I've watched someone talking
about<00:06:49.199> OPI<00:06:49.560> them<00:06:49.860> it's<00:06:50.669> recommended<00:06:51.540> really

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
about OPI them it's recommended really

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.260 
about OPI them it's recommended really
but<00:06:52.560> you<00:06:52.680> use<00:06:52.889> the<00:06:53.040> matte<00:06:53.280> as<00:06:53.550> a<00:06:53.610> base<00:06:53.910> coat

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
but you use the matte as a base coat

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.800 
but you use the matte as a base coat
then<00:06:55.020> you<00:06:55.229> nail<00:06:55.800> lacquer<00:06:56.250> then<00:06:56.850> the<00:06:57.300> clear<00:06:57.540> as

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
then you nail lacquer then the clear as

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.270 
then you nail lacquer then the clear as
a<00:06:57.840> top<00:06:58.050> coat<00:06:58.260> because<00:06:58.710> the<00:06:59.160> matte<00:06:59.370> has<00:06:59.910> them

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
a top coat because the matte has them

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.030 
a top coat because the matte has them
