00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
that other people can play instruments

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.170 
that other people can play instruments
and<00:05:43.050> they<00:05:43.289> can<00:05:43.470> play<00:05:43.680> multiple<00:05:44.220> instruments

this happens to be part of our culture

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.589 
this happens to be part of our culture
but<00:06:29.830> that<00:06:30.009> doesn't<00:06:30.580> mean<00:06:30.729> that<00:06:30.789> you<00:06:31.360> have<00:06:31.389> to

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
but that doesn't mean that you have to

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.719 
but that doesn't mean that you have to
be<00:06:31.930> asked<00:06:32.259> in<00:06:32.379> an<00:06:32.530> evening<00:06:32.710> to<00:06:33.159> come<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:33.610> enjoy

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
the music and to dance and so I think it

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.290 
the music and to dance and so I think it
enriches<00:06:40.629> our<00:06:41.289> country<00:06:41.889> to<00:06:42.370> have<00:06:42.580> festivals
