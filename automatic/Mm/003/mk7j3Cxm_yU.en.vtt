00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:08.410
 A child who was born to play 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.150
 Something those careful Toka that you are careful Takao-chan I Na there is a duality 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.049
 Nde I thought completely say 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.949
 That's why it's something of a great chara everyday 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.090
 Later in the game, I'm also talking about Mercer verification 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.980
 Because Kuroko's basketball is only Kuroko's 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:30.439
 It's like I 'm in a rival position, I just say so 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.760
 Will be the one also it Metchakucha consciousness a certain point I only rival because it is so 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.820
 Because I think 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.079
 It is not that monkey on the way, but it is such a declaration because it implies that declaration 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.940
 Things to come I softening So was incense N 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:50.699
 Something because really I think me of whether I probably rivals are wondering was Whoa 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:54.960
 Hirohon original and Now unlike in and Is in the animation of the person I Now match the eyes that talk is because I really have 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:58.329
 Because also that Kaha' of others Thats have Toka or diverted do you need dealt name 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.370
 As you face me at the time of the original so I say out loud out 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:07.310
 I 'm saying straight to that black computer, but when it's an anime , I'm saying that while she's 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:13.130
 It feels like I'm declaring something better when I'm out . 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:17.030
 It's really time to say that people are so amazing straight to see the other's men or it 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.659
 I think it's somewhat embarrassing because I'm never looking at that one 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:27.330
 What if the Which also is towards the animation with that original 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:32.340
 Because doing both things or tee Well e distress 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.530
 When I saw it with a god there, I got a flower against a basketball that was really serious 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.340
 So why express it in voice 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.159
 The difference between the time of the game and as much as possible 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:59.320
 The other is his time, which is kept from Shin-chan of Naa strong month 8 days woman 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:02:03.670
 Lucien carbon ar rear car scene scene nudity in the boo customers 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.740
 I thought that it was great and I was stupid, but I was particular about the important products of the game scene 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.690
 The Kedomo you can see the Tteyuu Rekusho down Te 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.480
 And Gujeri also notes Asia cut losses to each that person that put out when you pull the Carts 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.920
 Likely out but d cat to have been made as 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.500
 There because of I was really face it there be'm amazing Nema has become an easy-to-understand very well 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:37.970
 Is very 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:38.490
 Look said I did I was that it was well Tteyuu Patty Icarus cormorant Duro Concern 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.000
 Not 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:51.120
 It So is why noticed Kurokko first appearance Noah have to care what I think I do not have any I 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.650
 Well, when I sell it along with the shore of the lake, I'm standing here and there. 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.909
 can do 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:01.879
 It 's a bad body that makes someone rhythm 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.879
 It's so funny I'm going to face a face rhythm in Orleans 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:13.290
 Early three uniform scent ink and Mr. 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:17.850
 anon You seem to be active as an artist who is also a voice actor 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.320
 But after all these two were my brothers, but Japan was originally white or I wanted to do it originally 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:26.970
 Even though it seems to be a pulse , various children said various things in the beginning 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.760
 As a performer , I was thinking first of all as a star, and on that I would do it 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.870
 That 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:36.010
 Do what Tteyuu this oldcodex than the atmospheric Well words I artist 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.610
 What is visible by something or what is it that I 'm going to the face of me 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:44.769
 Oh Wu it so is that from publication 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.780
 Mine Tteyuu thing was I, for example, a Jejettoshi'm went up in a synergistic effect 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:52.459
 Hahn Toka or each other to believe this person is also representation 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.380
 By the way, it's very easy to say 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.030
 Sometimes it helps 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.270
 such by receiving the stimulus or with or looked like a lot of people in oldcodex 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.330
 There is an expression, too There is such a world There is a world I 'm thinking about already 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.770
 What's more, the world was so extravagant 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.250
 The world where you see the world 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.819
 In and we were or know strongly What Do Toka So I think Serve this kind of a it 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.620
 The sound of fighting 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.690
 Then it is a very interesting thing 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.519
 Everything is all 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.000
 Somehow What if after all I was a very necessary factor not I I where Rex to me 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.660
 Follow 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.100
 Well I think 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:32.780
 It seems that the synergetic effect appears in an easy to understand ending out this time 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:37.250
 Oh yeah Lagon say went to eat ending song unattended while also lie as a role after 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:41.360
 And all of what because it is so I'm so Huh it because I make also intense version are creating songs 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.950
 Kind of when to do oldcodex first for the first time what serves as the best or together 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.980
 If you talk to network I wish I can 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.980
 U 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:56.530
 I didn't know much about kr , but I'm glad I did that this time 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.530
 One is not a compilation but it is 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.350
 Well circle Innovation that sort of softening of Tteyuu is Do was one in their own manner is to some what 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.100
 Or 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:12.740
 That's right that kind of place 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.640
 Softening softening ambition like a Nde which I had wanted to do in their own manner I think also to me personally 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.040
 It was 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:23.460
 It is tie-up of the animation and it is also the song of their band 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.030
 I can't catch any of those anisons 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.100
 It lies Which even the songs I like not a Which song 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.180
 Though it is very contradictory, I see the ending of Kuroko's basketball in a woman passing through a straight line properly 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.390
 Say 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.030
 Because the picture of Kuroko's basketball ending is attached 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:43.870
 It will be the music of that Kuroko's basketball but it 's our music video 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.160
 Thats become its job in there where I when you're listening at Once was at Toka Toka a live cd 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.940
 Not always interesting 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.960
 Both faces are ending properly at the time of aluminum and ending 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:06:00.020
 Real is studded how much or whether not connected all gone in 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:05.900
 In the unseen pretend have also adapted those the piece like a have Both are up to 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.490
 To say whether a hate leakage of Tteyuu Son grinded it this way or what not big child I rate in the anime 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.300
 I hate more 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.470
 If it's two, it's okay to take a picture 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.010
 Double means 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.870
 So the double people the 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.100
 Pin device's Dagger 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:27.430
 A'to be made accustomed to say 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:30.940
 Oh oh that 's that double meaning, so the song 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.970
 May I introduce that 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.970
 Oh
