00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.099
 It is today Mikhail Ashotovich Bagdasarov 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.619
 announces the exit to the arena deserved 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.210
 artists of Russia and sometime for the first time on 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.539
 in the eyes of the public in a cage with tigers 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.150
 it was just his children Karinaâ€™s daughter 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.129
 became the youngest tamer 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.530
 her first performance in this capacity 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.080
 took place when Karina was 18 years old 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.879
 by the way the number of tigers in the attraction then 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.760
 also equaled 18 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.219
 arthur debuted 15 since it was 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.760
 many views of city viewers and 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.800
 countries 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.440
 but Kazakhstan tour has become special 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.149
 viewers first saw their Bagdasar 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.460
 leading the idea came to the corner literally 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.890
 recently in the second second city we carry 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.369
 we started the program in Karaganda just 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.369
 why because we still have here 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.610
 sticking out of the beginning is not sticking 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.550
 we are here at the very beginning and don't care 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.220
 we stand either in the aisle and we still look 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.049
 the program here just thought like it 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.350
 just stand were but better to hold 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.650
 program program which brother sister 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.869
 they were in the Almaty circus on November 23 almost 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.060
 did not differ from the usual scenario for 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.159
 a small exception for sweetheart 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.409
 Arthur came to visit him from 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.409
 Moscow performance began unexpectedly 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.580
 I 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.560
 shifter 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 but 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.920
 Well, it turned out really that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.780
 I came to the girls from Moscow here I 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.640
 That's just a long thought how is it better 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 to make 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.540
 for some reason I decided so I could not 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.310
 hold back i'm west because all that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.849
 connected with a loved one is 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.950
 so close it is so much mine 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.470
 it is necessary to notice not only both tears 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.540
 Karina is now called Arthur's Bride 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.790
 as well as his sister pnu and half 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.069
 auditorium including journalists 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.860
 era of gloss so we did not hear 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.840
 what was the answer yes how arthur is the most 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.849

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.420
 what did the ring answer me 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.190
 play his personal experiences not 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.410
 the only memories that 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.250
 connect artists from Kazakhstan 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:01.760
 Well, in the first place, we have 4 of you at all 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.890

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.870
 will consider it to climb or to compliment 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.209
 they are the most talented we have the most tigers 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.359
 worker who are yours to render 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.910
 roughly or strict Minsk west tigers 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:17.120
 brought up by Bagdasar they are recognized 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.280
 them artists mad they roar rush 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.380
 arguing with the tamer me in this and there 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.810
 animal attraction feature 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.030
 show in your character however not 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.510
 modest and trainers themselves 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.709
 sometimes 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.709
 roar on their charges 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.750
 but how else can we talk to them 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.700
 you teach it for a long time you are not right sweet yes 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.519
 but how daring you are and did not seem to be Karina 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.159
 Bagdasarova in work and manage to save 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.110
 amazing femininity and beauty by 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.269
 recognition of the artist when creating 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.409
 self image she was equal to 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.409
 Margarita Nazarov 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.180
 I can say only one 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:06.930
 animal trainer who works as a predator 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:09.390
 dresses and does not look like a peasant even 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.980
 on a rendezvous with a tiger Karina is in 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.390
 dress and heels 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.370
 really such clothes should 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.410
 meet a number of requirements 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.840
 it should be tight but 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.000
 supple so as not to hold down 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.980
 shoes sewn to order in dance 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.020

 Here she came up with these images as 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.570

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.680
 due am didn't received received in life 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.470
 trainers prefer comfort 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.330
 so wear jeans and sneakers 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.669

 I forgot the panic started wanted 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.880
 change the idea then realized that 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.820
 we can not give in to build ourselves 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.770
 create yourself some things that then 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.800

 which us guard the studio around 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.620
 Bagdasar and feels quite 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.199
 confidently under the protection of their saints on 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.479
 the question of what are they afraid of artur modestly 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.759
 replied that he did not like Okarina spiders 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.780

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.599
 strangers 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.090
 but seriously you know worse with 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.880
 people seem to me because they are the most 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.250
 unpredictable animals is a man 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.280
 loses you think this grid is blocking 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.280
 viewers from tigers or anything like that 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.280
