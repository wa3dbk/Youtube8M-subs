00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
this is a lab breakdown and I came up

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.700 
this is a lab breakdown and I came up
with<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.630> idea<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.990> couple<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.289> days<00:00:19.439> ago<00:00:19.500> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
with this idea a couple of days ago and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
with this idea a couple of days ago and
I<00:00:19.949> thought<00:00:20.130> well<00:00:20.340> let's<00:00:20.400> give<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.029> try<00:00:21.210> so
