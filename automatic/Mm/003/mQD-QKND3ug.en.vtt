a<00:01:02.280> edge<00:01:02.910> lit<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> motion<00:01:05.220> flow

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
a edge lit and we have the motion flow

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.149 
a edge lit and we have the motion flow
technology<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.119> goes<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> XR<00:01:06.780> 9<00:01:06.960> 6pm<00:01:07.409> nice

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
technology that goes up to XR 9 6pm nice

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.590
