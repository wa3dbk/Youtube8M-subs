00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.609
 very good people here we are in stand of 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.710
 hard for teams in the new mode already 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.230
 you know the way you get 50 more points 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.510
 for each low and good because nothing I put 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.460
 the mp7 a little bit I say come with 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.800
 this very loose you know the blue tiger 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 that is called the camouflage this that the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.820
 truth that I like is cool the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.390
 truth that is different gives you a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.369
 so I touch the somewhat cool weapon 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.409
 besides, I'm always tired of the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.659
 medium that is camouflaged new gene if 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.439
 the whole story is a roll I like 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.719
 plus 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.519
 because I wanted old hikes you know 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.320
 and well, nothing 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.379
 for people who do not know I'm here in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.600
 tito frank's house and vale I wanted to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.370
 give him a surprise and well I think what 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.079
 got left with his mouth open 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.550
 I also did not call the portal 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.129
 I directly knocked on the door of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.739
 house was thought to his brother and of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.030
 suddenly it opens the round x it is not that it was 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.670
 to record it in the truth that I did not have 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.519
 to have recorded because he put a face 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.519
 of surprised of the performance before 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.830
 but what are you doing someone please also 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.290
 and I said I had to Curran and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.490
 He swallowed it like a fool 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 poor thing and I said no no is that I can not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.500
 that is that I do not know what you can 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 record we had to record games were going 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.510
 to the typical ones you already know a little 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.180
 trailers and trial or as it is said or 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.550
 leave me that is not very deep and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.080
 so then I told him it's not that I have 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.640
 to go to the gym that I have to work 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.070
 what is so good that I do not know what not 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 I know when and then why in which 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.860
 It will be good for college directly 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 nothing I'm here at home in your house and such 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.690
 I have already brought this game 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.540
 here on a hard drive to comment on them 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.450
 here directly and good as nothing the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.580
 true that very well pleased thus a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.100
 I'm a little bit distracted that always 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.289
 you know the typical thing that in veranito also 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.649
 tell you a little bit to give you a spin 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.450
 and well, the truth is that it is 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.970
 well it's fun and good 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.210
 turning the game a little 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.450
 the streak of more than I like 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.300
 kiss the drone to escort and at the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.370
 be you already know that is a shit cha 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.220
 preferred but I also pass as a 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.960
 dwarf and well then nothing the truth that I 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.720
 I liked this game I know from 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.120
 that you are taken from you connect to the console 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.130
 and the first one that comes out and I had it 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.960
 like a dwarf the truth and well then 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.810
 nothing 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.480
 honestly I do not know if we will take 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.910
 streaming some day or something like that 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.180
 I thought about doing it because Carlos 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.420
 brought by the console the typical thing to be 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 geek 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.620
 the style but the truth that heat me 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.900
 I have to bring the console in case I have 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.300
 to play a game and things like that 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.030
 no and well then also the truth in what 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.060
 what I have thought is to do as a small 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.920
 setup there is no how I have it mounted 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.770
 so then good if you want that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.600
 make a video showing how I have my 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.330
 play area in case of tito frank and 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.730
 put it in the comments is worth that 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.280
 maybe some video as well as if 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.430
 It was a mushroom but in someone else's house 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.650
 hahaha there is a little bit there like 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.650
 moment of history because I believe that the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.290
 boarding that is very funny I'm not 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.330
 for nothing but I am a little meticulous 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.840
 with those things not and also brought me to 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.580
 team the ps3 the catcher I do not know who 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.130
 it is as soon as then I think that 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.260
 It would be very funny to do a setup to 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.900
 see if you feel like it and well then what's said 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.300
 If you want to see it, then less 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.630
 get in the comments and in a 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.610
 moment I take it recorded it and and apart we 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.830
 we see a dish that what fun 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.260
 and no good for nothing and has ended 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.240
 30 and do not know how many 30 and 23 better 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.100
 with the sun and sometimes you will not see it 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.140
 you see well the people who comment videos in 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.080
 those notebooks I imagine he knows 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.400
 everything knows from own experience and good 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.530
 nothing said what I hope that I have 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.070
 liked the game a greeting and until 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.070
 morning
