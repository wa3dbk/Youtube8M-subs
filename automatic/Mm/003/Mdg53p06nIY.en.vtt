older<00:00:16.770> sets<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.160> pipes<00:00:17.369> if<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> set<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
older sets of pipes if you have a set of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.650 
older sets of pipes if you have a set of
pipes<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.260> has<00:00:19.470> silver<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.189> them<00:00:20.510> you<00:00:21.510> can

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
pipes that has silver on them you can

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
pipes that has silver on them you can
often<00:00:21.960> date<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> silver<00:00:22.800> by<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.070> hallmarks

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
often date the silver by the hallmarks

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.050 
often date the silver by the hallmarks
but<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:25.400> no<00:00:26.400> silver

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
but this is no silver

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.179 
but this is no silver
it's<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> beautiful<00:00:27.869> set<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> tell

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it's a beautiful set and you can tell

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.030 
it's a beautiful set and you can tell
from<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.609> dark<00:00:30.119> dark<00:00:30.510> black<00:00:30.900> color<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
from the dark dark black color it's a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430 
from the dark dark black color it's a
little<00:00:32.279> bit<00:00:32.369> darker<00:00:32.850> than<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.870> wood<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
little bit darker than the wood that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.990 
little bit darker than the wood that
you'll<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.920> most<00:00:35.130> sets<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.579> pipes<00:00:35.820> which

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you'll see on most sets of pipes which

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.690 
you'll see on most sets of pipes which
are<00:00:36.120> african<00:00:36.600> blackwood<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.550> how<00:00:38.640> we

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
are african blackwood so that's how we

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.590 
are african blackwood so that's how we
think<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> set<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.660> ebony

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.110 

evany<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:46.070> highly<00:00:47.070> prized<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.970> its

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
evany is highly prized because of its

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.570 
evany is highly prized because of its
dark<00:00:48.329> color<00:00:48.630> and<00:00:48.840> also<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.470> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
dark color and also because of the the

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.670 
dark color and also because of the the
rareness<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.420> many<00:00:51.600> sets

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.840 

now<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.450> ivory<00:00:58.160> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.220> actually<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
now this is not ivory this is actually a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.730 
now this is not ivory this is actually a
really<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.360> old<00:01:02.420> imitation<00:01:03.420> ivory<00:01:03.810> and<00:01:04.620> if

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
really really old imitation ivory and if

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.460 
really really old imitation ivory and if
you<00:01:04.860> look<00:01:05.010> closely<00:01:05.690> if<00:01:06.690> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> tell<00:01:07.200> here

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you look closely if you can tell here

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.600 
you look closely if you can tell here
but<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:10.050> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> lines<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
but you can see some of the lines the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.860 
but you can see some of the lines the
lines<00:01:11.640> run<00:01:12.180> parallel<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.060> tell<00:01:15.300> when

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
lines run parallel and you can tell when

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.460 
lines run parallel and you can tell when
the<00:01:15.990> lines<00:01:16.200> were<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.470> parallel<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.310> it's

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
the lines were in parallel that it's

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.690 
the lines were in parallel that it's
celluloid<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.160> they're<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.550> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
celluloid you know they're one of the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.920 
celluloid you know they're one of the
early<00:01:21.150> early<00:01:21.330> imitation<00:01:22.140> ivories<00:01:23.540> if<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
early early imitation ivories if you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.280 
early early imitation ivories if you
look<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.310> piece<00:01:27.120> of<00:01:27.300> real<00:01:27.540> ivory<00:01:27.780> you'll<00:01:28.140> see

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
look at a piece of real ivory you'll see

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
look at a piece of real ivory you'll see
the<00:01:28.440> Schrager<00:01:28.770> lines<00:01:29.100> which<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> sort<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the Schrager lines which are the sort of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
the Schrager lines which are the sort of
the<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.390> crisscross<00:01:31.080> pattern<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:33.710> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the the crisscross pattern from the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.719 
the the crisscross pattern from the
ivory<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:37.160> lines<00:01:38.160> in<00:01:38.580> celluloid<00:01:39.390> are

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
ivory the lines in celluloid are

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
ivory the lines in celluloid are
parallel<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.140> look<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.440> some<00:01:43.590> pictures

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
parallel you can look up some pictures

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.350 
parallel you can look up some pictures
of<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.070> online<00:01:45.140> really<00:01:46.140> beautiful<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.830> mean

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
of that online really beautiful I mean

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.570 
of that online really beautiful I mean
it's<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.600> nice<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.229> any<00:01:49.470> imitation<00:01:50.160> ivory<00:01:50.550> that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
it's as nice as any imitation ivory that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.000 
it's as nice as any imitation ivory that
you'll<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.720> stopped<00:01:51.990> using<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.560> because

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
you'll see they stopped using it because

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.130 
you'll see they stopped using it because
from<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.550> I've<00:01:53.670> read<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.690> had<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.900> tendency<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
from what I've read it had a tendency to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.720 
from what I've read it had a tendency to
catch<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.320> fire<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.100> were<00:01:59.160> machining

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
catch on fire when they were machining

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.630 
catch on fire when they were machining
it<00:01:59.880> when<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> got<00:02:00.330> up<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:01.100> higher<00:02:02.100> temperatures

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
it when it got up to higher temperatures

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.310 
it when it got up to higher temperatures
from<00:02:02.940> spinning<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.780> lathe<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:07.200> could

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
from spinning on the lathe you could

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
from spinning on the lathe you could
catch<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.710> fire<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.730> pipes<00:02:08.940> made

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
catch on fire so we don't see pipes made

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.229 
catch on fire so we don't see pipes made
I've<00:02:09.239> celluloid<00:02:09.750> anymore<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:13.910> nice<00:02:14.910> looking

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I've celluloid anymore so nice looking

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:24.820 
I've celluloid anymore so nice looking
pipes

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.500 

nice<00:02:25.830> dark<00:02:26.490> color<00:02:29.360> now<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:31.230> blowpipe<00:02:32.510> take

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
nice dark color now the blowpipe take

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.610 
nice dark color now the blowpipe take
that<00:02:33.660> apart<00:02:33.960> here<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.960> blowpipe<00:02:40.350> mount

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
that apart here the blowpipe mount

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.930 
that apart here the blowpipe mount
actually<00:02:41.160> looks<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:43.010> might<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.340> real

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
actually looks like it might be real

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.240 
actually looks like it might be real
ivory<00:02:45.300> now<00:02:45.900> I'm<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.590> going<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.770> say<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.130> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
ivory now I'm not going to say that it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:58.920 
ivory now I'm not going to say that it
is<00:02:50.300> but<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.540> could<00:02:51.810> be

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.559 

now<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.530> might<00:02:59.680> see<00:02:59.890> there<00:03:00.099> looks<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.360> there

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
now you might see there looks like there

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.110 
now you might see there looks like there
might<00:03:01.720> be<00:03:02.040> some<00:03:03.040> little<00:03:03.220> cracks<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
might be some little cracks in the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.399 
might be some little cracks in the
blowpipe<00:03:04.540> stock<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:07.750> looks<00:03:07.989> like<00:03:08.140> there's<00:03:08.349> one

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
blowpipe stock it looks like there's one

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.500 
blowpipe stock it looks like there's one
a<00:03:08.830> little<00:03:08.980> one<00:03:09.190> here<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:12.099> chanter<00:03:12.549> stock<00:03:12.790> but

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
a little one here the chanter stock but

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.990 
a little one here the chanter stock but
as<00:03:13.629> far<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.140> drones<00:03:14.440> themselves

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
as far as the drones themselves

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.610 
as far as the drones themselves
absolutely<00:03:16.000> no<00:03:16.629> cracks<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.170> drones<00:03:17.409> are<00:03:17.530> in

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
absolutely no cracks the drones are in

absolutely no cracks the drones are in
perfect<00:03:17.829> condition<00:03:20.459> no<00:03:21.459> crack<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:21.970> if<00:03:22.180> you

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
perfect condition no crack so if you

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.509 
perfect condition no crack so if you
wanted<00:03:23.409> to<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.620> these<00:03:23.709> pipes<00:03:24.010> up<00:03:24.159> to<00:03:24.280> playing

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
wanted to get these pipes up to playing

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.750

because it's been rubbing on the
shoulder<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.269> players<00:04:01.569> do<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.200> see

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
somewhere in the lower sections four

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.650 
somewhere in the lower sections four
sections<00:04:06.250> tenors<00:04:06.730> look<00:04:06.880> really<00:04:07.180> nice<00:04:08.609> this

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
sections tenors look really nice this

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.809 
sections tenors look really nice this
middle<00:04:10.660> section<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.319> base<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:12.459> not

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
middle section of the base is not

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.809 
middle section of the base is not
original<00:04:13.510> from<00:04:13.840> as<00:04:13.930> best<00:04:14.200> as<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.530> can<00:04:14.590> tell<00:04:15.010> the

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
original from as best as I can tell the

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.330 
original from as best as I can tell the
combing<00:04:16.180> looks<00:04:16.359> slightly<00:04:16.660> different<00:04:19.229> this

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
combing looks slightly different this

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.529 
combing looks slightly different this
little<00:04:21.340> line<00:04:21.549> here<00:04:21.579> which<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.180> giveaway

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
little line here which is a giveaway

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.260 
little line here which is a giveaway
also<00:04:23.349> I<00:04:23.380> think<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.830> piece<00:04:24.190> might<00:04:24.639> be<00:04:24.789> african

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
also I think this piece might be african

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.940 
also I think this piece might be african
blackwood<00:04:25.539> because<00:04:26.139> it<00:04:26.289> looks<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.590> little<00:04:26.740> bit

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
blackwood because it looks a little bit

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.240 
blackwood because it looks a little bit
lighter<00:04:27.370> than<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.760> rest<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:28.090> them<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:30.070> that's

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
lighter than the rest of them so that's

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.830 
lighter than the rest of them so that's
the<00:04:30.340> one<00:04:30.490> thing<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:30.910> should<00:04:31.150> know<00:04:31.330> but

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
the one thing that you should know but

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.159 
the one thing that you should know but
other<00:04:32.020> than<00:04:32.260> that<00:04:32.320> everything<00:04:33.099> looks<00:04:34.169> 100%

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
other than that everything looks 100%

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.600 
other than that everything looks 100%
original<00:04:36.479> and<00:04:37.979> in<00:04:38.979> really<00:04:39.190> nice<00:04:39.400> condition

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
original and in really nice condition

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:49.500 
original and in really nice condition
you<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.389> see<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.699> do<00:04:48.820> get<00:04:48.970> some<00:04:49.030> wear

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
you can see and you do get some wear

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.200 
you can see and you do get some wear
which<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:49.900> would<00:04:50.050> expect<00:04:50.289> so<00:04:50.919> you<00:04:50.949> have<00:04:51.310> here

which you would expect so you have here
on<00:04:52.389> this<00:04:52.510> is<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.960> chanter<00:04:53.919> stock<00:04:54.190> then<00:04:55.120> gouged

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
on this is the chanter stock then gouged

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.180 
on this is the chanter stock then gouged
out<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.720> wonder<00:04:56.080> if<00:04:56.169> that<00:04:56.199> was<00:04:56.410> done<00:04:56.680> just<00:04:56.710> to

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
out I wonder if that was done just to

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.370 
out I wonder if that was done just to
help<00:04:57.910> with<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.240> tie<00:04:58.479> in<00:04:58.539> perhaps<00:04:59.260> a<00:05:00.270> little

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
help with the tie in perhaps a little

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.050 
help with the tie in perhaps a little
bit<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.440> character<00:05:02.830> there<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.639> it's<00:05:03.820> hard<00:05:03.970> to

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
bit of character there and it's hard to

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.899 
bit of character there and it's hard to
know<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.240> story<00:05:04.660> on<00:05:04.810> these<00:05:04.930> pipes<00:05:05.199> I<00:05:05.979> know

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
know the story on these pipes I know

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.450 
know the story on these pipes I know
very<00:05:07.240> little<00:05:07.390> about<00:05:07.659> them<00:05:08.020> except<00:05:08.380> for<00:05:08.460> what

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
very little about them except for what
