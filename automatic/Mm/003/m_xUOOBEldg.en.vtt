where<00:03:01.340> we<00:03:01.520> were<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.030> they<00:03:02.300> would<00:03:02.450> get<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.600> map

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
where we were and they would get a map

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.300 
where we were and they would get a map
and<00:03:03.080> then<00:03:03.170> they<00:03:03.260> would<00:03:03.410> send<00:03:03.860> us<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.070> message
