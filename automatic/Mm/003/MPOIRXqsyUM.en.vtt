at<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.460> much<00:01:16.729> much<00:01:16.970> slower<00:01:17.299> rate<00:01:17.390> than<00:01:17.869> having

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
at a much much slower rate than having

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.440 
at a much much slower rate than having

is true really of any style of music but
classical<00:01:23.570> music<00:01:23.840> because<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.290> written<00:01:24.500> and

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
classical music because it's written and

there's a precision to the to the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.530 
there's a precision to the to the
notation<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:28.369> really<00:01:28.760> tough<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.060> approach

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
notation it's really tough to approach

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.600 
notation it's really tough to approach
that<00:01:29.750> without<00:01:29.990> any<00:01:30.170> teacher<00:01:30.409> as<00:01:30.890> for<00:01:31.400> other

training<00:01:35.000> can<00:01:35.150> be<00:01:35.299> very<00:01:35.630> valuable<00:01:36.049> for

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
training can be very valuable for

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.920 
training can be very valuable for
