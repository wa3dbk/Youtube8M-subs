00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Well, welcome back to my channel 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.420
 we're still here with another part of 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.719
 basic tutorial about 4 people a video 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.790
 previous we are already clear that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 we have two engines that are looking at 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.500
 the sense that wrong so in this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 video what we are going to do is invest 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 the wires show them how to invest 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.320
 the direction of rotation of these engines is 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.000
 very easy and we will proceed to ensure 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.250
 these controllers that will meters 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.579
 we have with tape as you can see what 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.160
 we do with common tape we're going to 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.640
 to do, it's been nice to make sure they 're going well 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.829
 to reverse the edge of the two we believe 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.510
 invest and basically there will end 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 this video that is very short very simple 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.469
 and in the next one we're going to start 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.110
 mount the controller that is the most 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.780
 important of the quad copper then 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.780
 doing to remove these tapes 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:03.070
 remember we have here these 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.510
 these thermal tapes without catching yet 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.050
 so we can simply select 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.920
 two of these cables we work here the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.530
 tape as much as we can because if it is 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.350
 very close to the place where we are going to apply 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 heat can you catch us so this 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 another also the bottom what more can 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.750
 and I'm just going to desolder these 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.460
 two cables and invert them and with that I 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.460
 I assure change the engine turn 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.930
 here I will jump other cables that 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.780
 I'm going to invest after they're 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.030
 between soldiers I will not let them go 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.160
 still since if I loose them 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.250
 immediately I can confuse them with the 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.000
 other than welding here then what I'm going 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.520
 to do is before counting these two will 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.370
 to grab the one that should and there in that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.680
 position which is that is loose this and 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.870
 this one is going to stay here like this 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.870
 because that here the cables a little bit 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.579
 with this and so he avoided suddenly confusing 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.579
 which is which 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.790
 marin clear this here a little bit 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.900
 yes 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.820
 and well here and imbert and the cables 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.370
 and make sure that the welding is 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.010
 firm 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.989
 then we passed the suit again 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.269
 uncountable we have to cool down a 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.269
 little bit will not happen 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.940
 we look half 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.540
 now that we know that the turn is 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.660
 right and everyone passed on to catch these 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.280
 thermosensitive we make with a lighter 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.129
 not to apply much heat as 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.590
 if we can not finish burning the cable 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.360
 in the same way we are going to invest the 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.000
 I turn another to this other engine that is 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.340
 here and the other engines that have the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.540
 correct turn 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.470
 we just need to shrink the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.470
 Thermos is possible 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.730
 and it's done and it's ready and this 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.900
 procedure is done to this other engine 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.990
 that we already know that a 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.160
 right that was all for study and more 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:22.030
 later I will return to you I will apply the 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.130
 catch us engines that are missing in 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.050
 you catch yourselves incredibly invest 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.540
 this engine and I will do another test so that 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.800
 you see that the turn was already in 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.069
 the four engines correctly 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.830
 well I invested two cables of this 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.530
 engine or the cables of this engine have already 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.879
 run the carmen I took bless and I already 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.510
 accuse each leg or part of these 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:50.390
 four parts 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.510
 as you can see moorings having the 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.030
 controllers 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.130
 so that we will not move or fall if 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.410
 I'm going to connect the battery so that 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.750
 you see that the engines turn on the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.310
 meaning that it should as shown in 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.160
 the graph that is going to see 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.850
 then we arrived then connected 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.850
 Battery 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.180
 right now I'm going to use the tester 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.950
 pigs we start by the first for this 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.050
 engine that is here that we know that 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.180
 I was bad 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.860
 very important was not to connect this to 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.539
 reverse 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.539
 we throw ourselves in the engine 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:34.429
 remember that this motor must turn on 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.669
 this sense counterclockwise we are going to 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:36.669
 look 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.590
 and he was effectively turning on the 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.259
 meaning that we are going to try this engine 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.699
 from here that must turn clockwise 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.699
 that is to say in this sense 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.200
 is effectively turning in the direction 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.420
 that is let's review this engine should 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.260
 be filling in this sense is to say 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.260
 Clockwise 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.870
 is correct let's review the last 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.260
 point that they rotate in this sense direction 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.260
 counter-clockwise 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.660
 indeed the four are correct 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.810
 engines are turning in the direction 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.330
 correct and especially for this video already 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.760
 in the next video I'll finish 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:56.940
 screw the base that goes down here 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.940
 under it to remove the bottle 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:04.000
 here is the cava is going to end 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:08.440
 holding up well because it's 4 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.860
 in arms inside I'm going to do that part 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.230
 you then we will dominate not 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.380
 it is simply to screw 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:20.170
 basically it's going to be treated more than anything 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.510
 to organize and look good 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.700
 located the flight controller after 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.260
 that we have it well located that does not 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.050
 I'm going to make this contact with the party 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:33.610
 from below we can start to connect 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:36.430
 what is the radio control receiver 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:40.440
 and continue with the armed and with this 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.440
 tutorial 4 thanks
