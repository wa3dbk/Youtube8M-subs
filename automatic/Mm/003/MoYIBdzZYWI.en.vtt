00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.139 

so<00:00:00.240> we<00:00:00.420> have<00:00:00.690> here's<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.530> hemp<00:00:01.979> ship<00:00:02.399> or<00:00:02.730> also

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
so we have here's a hemp ship or also

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.150 
so we have here's a hemp ship or also
called<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.600> herd<00:00:03.840> which<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.740> internal

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
called the herd which is the internal

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.480 
called the herd which is the internal
part<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.879> stem<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> plant<00:00:07.490> that's

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
part of the stem of the plant that's

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.390 
part of the stem of the plant that's
mixed<00:00:08.940> with<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.120> line-based<00:00:09.690> binder<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:11.250> with

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
mixed with a line-based binder so with

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.339 
mixed with a line-based binder so with
that<00:00:11.519> line-based<00:00:12.059> binder<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> half

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
that line-based binder and the half

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.510 
that line-based binder and the half
we've<00:00:14.009> got<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> negative<00:00:14.820> carbon<00:00:15.089> footprint

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
we've got a negative carbon footprint

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.220 
we've got a negative carbon footprint
now<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.580> difference<00:00:18.180> between<00:00:18.240> lime<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
now the difference between lime and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
now the difference between lime and
concrete<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.490> wine<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
concrete is that wine you don't have to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.019 
concrete is that wine you don't have to
heat<00:00:21.869> up<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.350> much<00:00:22.680> concrete<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.850> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
heat up as much concrete you have to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
heat up as much concrete you have to
heat<00:00:24.210> up<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> through<00:00:24.630> almost<00:00:24.779> 3,000<00:00:25.769> degrees

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
heat up the through almost 3,000 degrees

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
heat up the through almost 3,000 degrees
which<00:00:26.369> takes<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> energy<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.900> has<00:00:28.140> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
sequester spark let me tell you how it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.630 
sequester spark let me tell you how it
does<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
does that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060 
does that
first<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.750> any<00:00:37.079> cellulose<00:00:37.620> material

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
first of all any cellulose material

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
first of all any cellulose material
would<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.670> example<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.180> hemp<00:00:39.420> takes<00:00:40.350> carbon

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
would for example or hemp takes carbon

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.170 
would for example or hemp takes carbon
in<00:00:40.860> during<00:00:41.070> its<00:00:41.190> life<00:00:41.370> cycle<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.879> usually

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in during its life cycle and usually

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
in during its life cycle and usually
when<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.570> decays<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.200> lets<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.620> into<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
when it decays it lets it back into the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
when it decays it lets it back into the
atmosphere<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> take<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.360> plant<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
atmosphere if you take that plant and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
atmosphere if you take that plant and
then<00:00:45.930> put<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.500> wall<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.309> example<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
then put it into a wall for example in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
then put it into a wall for example in
heme<00:00:47.879> Creek<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.780> carbon<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.289> now

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
heme Creek then that carbon is now

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
heme Creek then that carbon is now
sequestered<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> wall<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:50.789> becoming

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
sequestered in the wall and not becoming

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.130 
sequestered in the wall and not becoming
part<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> climate<00:00:51.629> change

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
part of climate change

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.830 
part of climate change
so<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> hempcrete<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.239> building<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> one

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so the hempcrete in this building is one

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
so the hempcrete in this building is one
building<00:00:55.110> alone<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:55.620> sequester<00:00:56.160> 20,000

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
building alone will sequester 20,000

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540 
building alone will sequester 20,000
pounds<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.539> carbon<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.250> pretty<00:00:59.399> big

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
pounds of carbon that's a pretty big

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
pounds of carbon that's a pretty big
accomplishment<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> best

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
accomplishment I think this is the best

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
accomplishment I think this is the best
wall<00:01:01.469> system<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> world<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.609> I'm<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.270> I'm

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
wall system in the world so I'm all I'm

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
wall system in the world so I'm all I'm
all<00:01:03.840> about<00:01:04.049> him<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.739> an<00:01:04.890> important

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
all about him I think it's an important

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.600 
all about him I think it's an important
thing<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:06.810> push<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> food

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
thing to to push as a because it's food

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
thing to to push as a because it's food
fiber<00:01:08.939> building<00:01:09.840> material<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.920> I'm

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
fiber building material but really I'm

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.320 
fiber building material but really I'm
choosing<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.430> material<00:01:11.850> because<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
choosing this material because it's the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.910 
choosing this material because it's the
best<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.810> terms<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.110> building<00:01:13.409> science<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
best in terms of building science and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.690 
best in terms of building science and
why<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.159> true

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
why is that true

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
why is that true
first<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> what's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
first of all because this is a what's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.740 
first of all because this is a what's
often<00:01:17.430> called<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> breathable<00:01:18.090> wall<00:01:18.330> system

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
often called a breathable wall system

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.030 
often called a breathable wall system
and<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.990> mean<00:01:19.170> breathable<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.590> air<00:01:19.770> we're

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and I mean breathable for air we're

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980 
and I mean breathable for air we're
actually<00:01:20.220> building<00:01:20.460> an<00:01:20.640> airtight<00:01:21.000> wall<00:01:21.270> but

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually building an airtight wall but

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
actually building an airtight wall but
it's<00:01:22.259> breathable<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.770> water<00:01:23.009> why<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.700> an

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's breathable for water why is that an

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 
it's breathable for water why is that an
advantage<00:01:24.000> well<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> typical<00:01:25.170> wall<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
advantage well in a typical wall you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.010 
advantage well in a typical wall you
have<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> cavity<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.150> seal<00:01:27.450> tightly<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
have a cavity that you seal tightly and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
have a cavity that you seal tightly and
then<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> fill<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.530> insulation<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.790> water

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
then you fill with insulation well water

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.850 
then you fill with insulation well water
will<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.900> inside<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.380> cavity<00:01:31.619> because

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
will get inside that cavity because

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.039 
will get inside that cavity because
water<00:01:32.189> does<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.270> its<00:01:33.450> job<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> world

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
water does that's its job in the world

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
water does that's its job in the world
my<00:01:34.229> body<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> 70%<00:01:34.740> water<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> dissolve<00:01:36.240> any

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
my body is 70% water it can dissolve any

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
my body is 70% water it can dissolve any
material<00:01:36.930> any<00:01:37.110> way<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.700> want<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.030> do

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
material any way so what we want to do

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
material any way so what we want to do
in<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> building<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.079> create<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> wall<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
in a building is create a wall that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490 
in a building is create a wall that
welcomes<00:01:41.880> water<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.479> doesn't<00:01:42.780> rot<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
welcomes water but doesn't rot when it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.660 
welcomes water but doesn't rot when it
lets<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> water<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.430> exactly

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
lets the water in and that's exactly

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.170 
lets the water in and that's exactly
what<00:01:44.909> henfrey<00:01:45.060> does<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:46.790> when<00:01:47.790> humidity

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
what henfrey does it when humidity

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.389 
what henfrey does it when humidity
changes<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> air<00:01:48.810> outside<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.950> wall<00:01:50.159> can

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
changes in the air outside the wall can

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.210 
changes in the air outside the wall can
take<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.390> extra<00:01:51.659> humidity<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> hold<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
take on that extra humidity and hold it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340 
take on that extra humidity and hold it
until<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.000> humidity<00:01:54.360> drops<00:01:54.659> outside<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
until the humidity drops outside and it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.480 
until the humidity drops outside and it
will<00:01:55.439> let<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.619> back<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> meantime

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
will let it back out in the meantime

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.700 
will let it back out in the meantime
because<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.600> line<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.110> wrapped<00:01:58.259> around<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
because the line is wrapped around the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.160 
because the line is wrapped around the
cellulose<00:01:59.130> the<00:02:00.030> cellulose<00:02:00.360> won't<00:02:00.600> rot<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
cellulose the cellulose won't rot the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
cellulose the cellulose won't rot the
lime<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.649> trying<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> go<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.369> being<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
lime is trying to go back to being a

lime is trying to go back to being a
rock

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
rock

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.810 
rock
that<00:02:03.650> means<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.130> role<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.730> get

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
that means this role is going to get

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.690 
that means this role is going to get
harder<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.510> harder<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.350> harder<00:02:06.830> over<00:02:07.280> time

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
harder and harder and harder over time

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.330 
harder and harder and harder over time
it's<00:02:07.970> going<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.149> petrify<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.070> is<00:02:10.160> these

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
it's going to petrify so this is these

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.610 
it's going to petrify so this is these
walls<00:02:10.580> will<00:02:10.789> last<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.210> thousands<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.960> years

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
walls will last for thousands of years

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.470 
walls will last for thousands of years
not<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.130> forty<00:02:13.730> years<00:02:13.940> like<00:02:14.150> what<00:02:14.300> we're<00:02:14.450> used

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
not a forty years like what we're used

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.870 
not a forty years like what we're used
