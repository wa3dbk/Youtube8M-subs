00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
this in trouble and I mean I think the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.160 
this in trouble and I mean I think the
coaches<00:02:11.490> did<00:02:12.000> realize<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.870> know<00:02:12.960> that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.050

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
off their talent in and that's why the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
off their talent in and that's why the
games<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:17.970> at<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.330> pace<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:19.020> and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
games going at the pace it's going and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.980 
games going at the pace it's going and
you<00:02:19.830> know<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.160> much<00:02:20.570> product<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.690> really

another guy in the bag I played with we

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.690 
another guy in the bag I played with we
sort<00:05:07.810> of<00:05:07.900> controlled<00:05:08.200> we<00:05:08.350> gave<00:05:08.530> up<00:05:08.560> one<00:05:09.490> goal

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
sort of controlled we gave up one goal

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.670 
sort of controlled we gave up one goal
maybe<00:05:09.960> when<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:11.050> were<00:05:11.140> playing<00:05:11.350> together<00:05:11.470> in

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
maybe when we were playing together in

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.680 
maybe when we were playing together in
the<00:05:11.740> middle<00:05:12.010> so<00:05:12.670> I<00:05:12.700> thought<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.030> did<00:05:13.390> well<00:05:13.510> in

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
the middle so I thought I did well in

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.480 
the middle so I thought I did well in
this<00:05:13.780> sense<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.110> my<00:05:14.680> stock<00:05:15.010> was<00:05:15.130> going<00:05:15.160> up

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
this sense that my stock was going up

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.580 
this sense that my stock was going up
inside<00:05:16.000> out<00:05:16.240> on<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.540> outside<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:16.960> was<00:05:17.200> kind<00:05:17.560> of

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
inside out on the outside I was kind of

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.810 
inside out on the outside I was kind of
questioning<00:05:17.920> myself<00:05:18.040> I<00:05:18.430> played<00:05:18.670> in<00:05:18.760> the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
questioning myself I played in the

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.280 
questioning myself I played in the
middle<00:05:18.970> throughout<00:05:19.960> my<00:05:20.080> whole<00:05:20.230> life

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
middle throughout my whole life

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.760 
middle throughout my whole life
basically<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.280> playing<00:05:22.030> out<00:05:22.150> why<00:05:22.300> right<00:05:22.770> it's

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
basically and playing out why right it's

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.500 
basically and playing out why right it's
kind<00:05:23.980> of<00:05:24.040> thinking<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.400> myself<00:05:24.430> is<00:05:24.850> this<00:05:25.360> gonna

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
kind of thinking to myself is this gonna

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.530 
kind of thinking to myself is this gonna
hurt<00:05:25.750> me<00:05:25.930> or<00:05:26.170> what<00:05:26.500> can<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.740> do<00:05:26.920> to<00:05:27.040> me<00:05:27.540> like

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
hurt me or what can this do to me like

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.020 
hurt me or what can this do to me like
stock<00:05:28.870> wise<00:05:29.080> I<00:05:29.380> kind<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.890> didn't<00:05:30.430> talk<00:05:30.700> as<00:05:30.850> much

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
stock wise I kind of didn't talk as much

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.670 
stock wise I kind of didn't talk as much
on<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.270> outside<00:05:31.600> don't<00:05:31.870> kind<00:05:32.170> of<00:05:32.260> see<00:05:32.440> things

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
on the outside don't kind of see things

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.480 
on the outside don't kind of see things
like<00:05:33.250> you<00:05:33.520> do<00:05:33.640> in<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:33.820> middle<00:05:34.090> so<00:05:34.300> my<00:05:35.110> my<00:05:35.500> vocal

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
like you do in the middle so my my vocal

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.190 
like you do in the middle so my my vocal
leadership<00:05:36.850> kind<00:05:37.060> of<00:05:37.150> fell<00:05:37.450> down<00:05:37.630> there<00:05:37.870> after

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
leadership kind of fell down there after

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.560 
leadership kind of fell down there after
a<00:05:38.590> sloppy<00:05:38.950> day<00:05:39.250> one<00:05:39.520> players<00:05:40.210> seemed<00:05:40.480> to

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
a sloppy day one players seemed to

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.850 
a sloppy day one players seemed to
settle<00:05:40.840> in<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.230> the<00:05:41.320> level<00:05:41.590> of<00:05:41.650> play

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
settle in and the level of play

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.220 
settle in and the level of play
increased<00:05:42.310> it<00:05:43.060> was<00:05:43.210> a<00:05:43.240> bit<00:05:43.750> of<00:05:43.840> rough<00:05:44.020> going

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
increased it was a bit of rough going

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.370 
increased it was a bit of rough going
through<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.220> first<00:05:45.460> day<00:05:45.640> but<00:05:45.940> by<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:46.990> second

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
through the first day but by the second

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.350 
through the first day but by the second
and<00:05:47.440> third<00:05:47.590> day<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:47.830> think<00:05:47.980> coaches<00:05:48.460> saw<00:05:48.640> what

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
and third day I think coaches saw what

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.760 
and third day I think coaches saw what
they<00:05:49.600> thought<00:05:49.630> they<00:05:49.960> would<00:05:50.110> see<00:05:50.320> coming<00:05:50.680> in

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
they thought they would see coming in

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.500 
they thought they would see coming in
this<00:05:50.890> year<00:05:50.950> which<00:05:51.280> is<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.490> deep<00:05:51.790> group<00:05:52.090> that<00:05:52.420> was

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
this year which is a deep group that was

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.490 
this year which is a deep group that was
better<00:05:52.690> than<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:52.990> year<00:05:53.020> before

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
better than the year before

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.190 
better than the year before
yeah<00:05:53.770> I<00:05:53.800> mean<00:05:53.950> there's<00:05:54.280> obviously<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.640> lot<00:05:54.700> more

very<00:06:31.460> important<00:06:31.969> for<00:06:32.059> me<00:06:32.149> to<00:06:32.180> go<00:06:32.360> in<00:06:32.479> there

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:32.629 
very important for me to go in there

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.719 
very important for me to go in there
because<00:06:32.779> you<00:06:33.620> know<00:06:33.740> a<00:06:33.770> lot<00:06:34.039> of<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:34.249> generation

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
because you know a lot of the generation

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.760 
because you know a lot of the generation
adidas<00:06:34.939> kids<00:06:35.330> it's<00:06:35.960> tempting<00:06:36.259> to<00:06:36.409> take<00:06:36.620> them

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
adidas kids it's tempting to take them

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.139 
adidas kids it's tempting to take them
earlier<00:06:37.069> because<00:06:37.430> they<00:06:37.580> don't<00:06:37.729> go<00:06:37.939> against

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:38.149 
earlier because they don't go against

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.600 
earlier because they don't go against
salary<00:06:38.569> cap<00:06:38.870> you<00:06:39.139> know<00:06:39.259> they<00:06:40.069> don't<00:06:40.219> go

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
salary cap you know they don't go

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.360

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
against roster spots and whatnot so I

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.920 
against roster spots and whatnot so I
knew<00:06:43.669> it<00:06:43.729> was<00:06:43.909> very<00:06:44.089> important<00:06:44.569> for<00:06:44.659> me<00:06:44.719> to<00:06:44.779> go

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930
