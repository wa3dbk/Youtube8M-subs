00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello to all guys so spartan 117 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 welcome to this new guide to 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.940
 weapons of battlefield 4 today we will go 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.040
 to see the former 23 weapon for the assault kit 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 doctor that you want and credible through 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.099
 an assignment that you will see on screen in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.230
 This time we start with a bit of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.310
 history on this weapon lace 23 is part 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.260
 from the category of assault rifles 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.720
 Welsh developed by the Israelis o 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.279
 more precisely from the uk israeli paul 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.109
 industry passing instead to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.939
 technical characteristics of the weapon 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.500
 denials I will have a maximum damage of 25 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.130
 damage through fault that will begin to fall 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.660
 at 8 meters up to 55 where they will reach 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.550
 minimum of 18 damage per hit 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.219
 however it remains very good this implies 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.920
 that a normal life to kill us 146 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 shots from 4 September 6 while mode 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.730
 veteran three or four shots 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 in addition to this your smith 3 will own a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 rate of fire and 770 strokes per minute 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.210
 with a magazine of 31 shots 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 the time to recharge the weapon instead 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.530
 varies from 2.1 to 3.1 seconds 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.629
 always according to the charger is full 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 empty now passing to the treasure in the ass 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.039
 you will immediately notice two features 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.290
 important of the quits 3 the first is that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.630
 the very strong vertical recoil but 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.270
 the horizontal recall aiming is almost 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 non-existent both automatic fire on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.030
 single shot you will notice that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.770
 mainly sure it will be all 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 vertical then with accessories 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 just reducing this too 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 the second one will be very precise 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.850
 tip that the fire did not give me ago 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.259
 really sucks because in both cases 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.720
 both with automatic fire that has 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.430
 single bullet will really be too much 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.320
 wide range in which dragons projectiles 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.909
 run of the accessories instead advice 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 as if you frankly think of me as an optic because 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.049
 for me it is almost a fetishism I always have 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.270
 said and I repeat this is the perspective 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.189
 precise because not from zoom but to 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.810
 same time remains very precise as 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.090
 I always say don't put anything in between 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.979
 torch viewfinder thief both because 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 honestly I consider them enough 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.399
 useless for minor aser anyway 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.869
 I mean the laser pointer what goes 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.820
 below the house what makes the dot 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.710
 red we say because I think they serve 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.869
 let me sgam slightly 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 fire not targeted but honestly not 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.110
 found life's key is the assault in 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.149
 whose advantage is precisely the targeted fire 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.560
 under the board I recommend the squat handle 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.420
 because it will diminish the recoil 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.040
 vertical and has a real touch a real 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.110
 Good for this weapon as we have 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.640
 already seen while on the council card or 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.610
 the silencer for the always the usual 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.230
 history of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.390
 if you know if you are in enemy territory 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.010
 at least you don't do sgam or a 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.410
 compensator which also increases 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.030
 the targeted focus then the vertical one 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.920
 then make the rome more precise 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.510
 when it will be said to admire then it seems to me 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.730
 needless to say that this Arab also with the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.340
 automatic fire you will not have to press the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.780
 trigger without apple tree until it has 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.000
 killed the opponent very probable thing 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.230
 until you have killed yourself, but rather 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.580
 you will have to continue to area shoots to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.220
 burst and this applies to practically 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.440
 all weapons because they rarely hold the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.060
 trigger finger will be useful because 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.890
 even if the weapon does not have the mode 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.980
 of fire rafica you will have to go to 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.170
 always shoot bursts by ordering shot 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.540
 I always shoot and make gusts of 34 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.070
 strokes that are because anyway 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.680
 will allow in particular with this weapon 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.480
 to have truly lethal precision 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.930
 that's why the video is coming to 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.430
 term 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.260
 I said everything I had to tell you about 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.700
 but this weapon in a few words I do 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.140
 a question to all those who tell me 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.390
 as long as I speak very quickly 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.870
 what do you think while I'm talking video? 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.270
 tried I really strove it is 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.250
 it really is really an effort for me to 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.830
 speak more or less slowly about the tone 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.060
 calm calm without overlapping words 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.980
 similar things 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.110
 but as you can see I get a tone 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.180
 too much at most I fall asleep talking 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.280
 so I must be honest because I was told between 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.140
 we now you politics like you me 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.209
 I don't know if I give the idea 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.920
 I really tormented him because 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.230
 I do not spontaneously speak like this 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.900
 slowly however I wanted to show 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.910
 as for me rightly a goria 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.470
 said that the video is coming to an end 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.910
 I invite you to let me like a comment 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.769
 sign up if you haven't done it yet 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.840
 the usual things you have by now understood 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.400
 when I have another I will not tell you either 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.320
 but let's discard it I'll tell you the same 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.000
 but I invite you to see the others 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.190
 guides on this channel always between maps 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.989
 weapons equipment what you want o 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.130

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.130
 and we feel the next
