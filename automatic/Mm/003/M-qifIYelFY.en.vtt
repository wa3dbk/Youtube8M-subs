00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.919
 because of thieves we keep talking about 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.629
 house thieves who also show 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.669
 your interest in mobile homes about 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.650
 robberies that are becoming more common 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.299
 Yesterday that state in Biscay was 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.099
 stopped a man after being surprised 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.349
 by the ertzaintza at the moment when 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.950
 he tried to enter inside 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.950
 a motorhome 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.190
 It was one o'clock yesterday afternoon when 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.050
 a patrol of the ertzaintza saw 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.910
 move some legs through the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.950
 window of a motorhome in this 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.200
 parking of that state next to the street 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.910
 AndrÃ© de Jaureguibeitia when 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.370
 They approached the alarm of the motorhome 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 it started to sound and that made the young 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.540
 that was inside of 19 years 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.730
 had to come out with several cuts in 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.980
 the hands had blood also the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.989
 they found in the window and that is 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.940
 it has been usual for robberies to 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.879
 occur in this type of vehicles 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.790
 You see here what little sign they have 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.440
 left empty please do not break anything 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.660
 to enter every time more are produced 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.570
 robberies in motor homes antonio you are 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.850
 a specialist in this sector and I do not know 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.100
 if many customers come to you with breakdowns 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.089
 enough is very common stealing the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.610
 motorhomes 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.619
 break to find someone inside 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.149
 it seems that it can be something more sweet than 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.770
 there are possibilities to find something else 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.380
 than in a simple car and they think that 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.050
 so you can find some cameras 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.119
 portable mobile video putting when 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.710
 some small security system 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.520
 we can have more security 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.710
 inside of her 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.740
 for example what would be the measures of 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.899
 most common agreement would be these closures 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.240
 the so-called doer that what we do 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.549
 is to block like that even if we have opened 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.590
 at the door we could not open the door 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.899
 and very difficult to break because it is a 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.119
 metallic system the windows given that 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.069
 are easy to break we can put some 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.619
 Motion sensors like bilbija 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.600
 of them quickly make a small 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.030
 effort can be placed one in each 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.679
 window and even in the cabin with a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.200
 remote control that can warn us 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.060
 even to the mobile phone in case 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.920
 skip the alarm plus systems for 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.720
 protect these caravans our 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.280
 motorhomes also look every day 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.450
 more in this society that we go with 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.090
 all in tow with the house in tow 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.909
 what this would be would be a system of 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.590
 gas detection the typical gases 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.390
 narcotics that they want to throw so that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.069
 we are formed inside and we can not do 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.019
 nothing that would jump an alarm that we 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.670
 I would expect we have a security lock 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.160
 like the one we've seen at the door of 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.680
 the caravan for the cabin area 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.420
 more or less total cost to ensure this 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.519
 motorhome about sixty euros from the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.170
 entrance door about sixty euros of 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.780
 the cabin doors and about 100 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.640
 the gas alarm and an alarm and I say 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.860
 we have from small sensors that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 let's put the 15 euros unit or one 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.310
 alarm already with four sensors and that we 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.709
 call home around 700 euros 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.990
 for 300 euros more or less rounding 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.720
 we go back to making a 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.110
 something basic and for a thousand euros something already 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.610
 more positions to pay yes more or less 50 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.980
 thousand euros can come to cost a car 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540
 it is little amount for what we spend 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.960
 within one they touch towards the best is 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.090
 always leave open and that the caco that 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.270
 may want to enter that you see that there is no 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.210
 nothing if not the thief many cabals 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.830
 they imagine many treasures and it enters that 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.450
 imagine that there may be something when in 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.190
 actually when we have nothing then what 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.890
 It is better to leave always open because more 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.330
 It is then necessary to prevent regret and 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.800
 They are exhausted and almost alarm 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.390
 everyone is today the first thing that puts 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.660
 so then we are waiting for 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.660
 to receive
