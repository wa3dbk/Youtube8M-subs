00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:08.950
Jesus said that man will not live from bread
alone but from every Word that proceeds from

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.460
the Mouth of God.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:20.410
The Words that Jesus Christ spoke are the
Words of eternal life and those Words were

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.460
recorded in the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.639
Those are the Words of eternal life FOR THOSE
WHO OBEY THEM.

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:44.710
Those Words are true Bread and those who obey
them will LIVE by those Words, but people

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.699
don't want to obey the Words of Jesus and
therefore they listen to people.

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:01.069
They go and listen to PEOPLE at churches,
which are franchises, they eat junk food.

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:09.189
They listen to people9preachers) who entertain
them with their own thoughts, theories and

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:17.570
theologies, but they will not accept the Words
of Jesus Christ and that is why they will

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.140
perish.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:30.970
They go to these franchises, CHURCHES ARE
FRANCHISES, there are Methodists, Apostolic,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:41.829
Calvinist, Baptist, all kinds of franchises
that belong to the Kingdom of Church and all

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.049
of these franchises dish up their own junk
food.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.969
The Words of Jesus are true Bread, that is
the Bread of Life.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.380
If you want eternal life?

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.740
Go and read the Words of Jesus as recorded
in the Gospels and the Holy Spirit will confirm

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.110
those Words to you, will write them on your
heart and will remind you of the Words of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.500
Life, the Words of Jesus Christ, the WORDS
THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE MOUTH OF GOD.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.590
Jesus said: "My sheep listen to My voice and
they follow Me."

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.200
Who are you listening to?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.720
Do you listen to the Words of Jesus and receive
the Words that proceed from the Mouth of God?

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.220
Or are you eating junk food, listening to
the junk that comes of the pulpits of the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.500
franchises, the churches of this world?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:01.060
If you want eternal life, LISTEN TO THE WORDS
OF JESUS CHRIST and OBEY them, don't listen

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.630
to the fast food franchises.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.880
May Jesus bless you.
