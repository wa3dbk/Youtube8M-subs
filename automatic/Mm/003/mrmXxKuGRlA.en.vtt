00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.250
 hello guys are here for another biology class 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.620
 and today we will talk about the circulatory system the circulation of 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.960
 animals 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.619
 and I would like you to preserve yes yes the following question 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.979
 what is the importance of the circulatory system for the life of beings 

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.399
 alive 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.419
 then we have the image of the heart of mammals our heart 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.480
 The heart is a very important album because through 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.670
 blood pumped to all tissues to all cells 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.180
 through its contraction 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.739
 movement known as if they are there 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 paulo relaxation also known as pedia a story 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.390
 personal blood is very important is a liquid that circulates in the body of 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.500
 animals and that we carry breathing gas 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.860
 the nutrients 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.130
 excretes the hormones 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.140
 but who killed 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500
 A trick that you can not forget 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.619
 we are not sure the blood known as in a beautiful farc 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.729
 he did not transport breathing gas 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
 and it's about that image that we're going to talk about now 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.500
 Are you seeing there? 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 then we have a cne motion in the insects 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.050
 the insect its blood circulating within each life says is a system 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.090
 Open 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.890
 Insects blood system is a system where everything is new one leading 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.729
 through this liquid 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.900
 the nutrients people blind 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.430
 we receive excreta 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.030
 but as the weaving and messi 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.509
 in this animal it is carried by the trachea 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.749
 directly from the environment the cell 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.759
 then this blood system 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.990
 your next move 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.990
 we do not transport respiratory gases 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.790
 is different 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.350
 of other animals as we will observe 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.619
 there are animals that the system reopens as in the case of insects. 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.500
 blood circulates in the rainbow 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.440
 in spaces in the animal's body 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.750
 just as there are closed systems where blood circulates inside 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.249
 I am not a server used will be then 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.249
 some examples of the movement of animals 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.049
 then protected 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.589
 Protozoan refers to the feiteira responsible for living water 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.589
 until now 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.749
 we have there the solitary 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.850
 I think it's time not to fight. 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.299
 it is not that on the berm that is the laughter of the sea 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.069
 all these animals we have the absence of the circulatory system 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.709
 true 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.580
 while we here from above say 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.929
 so the crustacean insects is that nobody says 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.459
 the mollusk 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.010
 we have the mussels there in the protocols of my son in prison 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.849
 the system is there to conar 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.919
 Open 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:10.949
 in the fish the amphibians that the reptiles warn of the mysterious and in addition to bring the 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.710
 my local what this one said he 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.210
 my work has a closed circulatory system 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.050
 then the circulatory system of animals 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.200
 depending on its size 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.740
 it is of greater importance than for other animals 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.999
 or badly how it will act for example has to have a very 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:30.940
 efficient 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.069
 to transport your nutrients 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.099
 to the cells of your brain for example 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.359
 and now we'll know a bit more about circulation for example 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.359
 two as good musicians in this billions 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.339
 so we have there 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.790
 the spaces that I will find in the body of the animal 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.790
 are the gaps in the body tissues of the victim 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:00.700
 sandy when it comes out of these tissues but being carried to the great floods 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.879
 where will occur 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.329
 then the hematologist changes 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.049
 the couple to feel bad 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.639
 later this blood will be taken to the heart of the 'animal' 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.950
 which has two cavities in the meadow and the atrium and yesterday the tricolou 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.209
 from the heart we're going to have blood transportation 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.210
 for breading gaps 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.250
 in the body of that animal to the tissues of that animal 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.099
 then in this case the animal has a slower circulation so it is 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.999
 an open circulation 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:37.319
 now let's see how the circulation of an animal I present 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:37.889
 the system 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.249
 closed 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.249
 we have there the circulation of the line the mouth 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.990
 You all know the gas exchange 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.280
 the rapporteur said that it is possible to receive oxygen 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.290
 eliminate carbon dioxide 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.279
 is made through the skin and mucosa 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:00.180
 we then have there the entry of the simple act my output of carbon dioxide 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.720
 we have a closed circulatory system nor did you know 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.780
 several hearts occupying the region 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.469
 enter the animal 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:15.419
 we have a blood vessel pain are something we have a blood vessel 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:16.599
 among the 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.300
 these blood vessels and which are important to 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.550
 nutrients leading to serginho 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.580
 and also received the scribes and also receives the day when proceeding 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.650
 carbon 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.880
 and now we are going to talk a little bit about the circulation of 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.420
 vertebrates must also break those we have amphibian fish and reptiles 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.379
 birds and mammals 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.809
 then we'll start with the circulation of the fish hamas 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.169
 but then we have the circulation beginning with sandy coming from the body of the 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.629
 animals 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.810
 he is being cut all scenes of this animal 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.499
 he has the rich blood of al aqsa of carbon 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:58.210
 so it is called a happy sendim 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.939
 reaches the heart 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.270
 'goldfish' is indicated 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.689
 we have now 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.330
 the bag pulls out said the owner of this animal's heart 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.419
 we got there and I criticized him in the 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.650
 so let's not forget Serranista passing through the heart of the fish is the 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.869
 You did not dare next. 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:23.529
 scn now goes to the gills where hematology occurs gas exchange 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.410
 the entry into the hut serginho 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.010
 and the output of carbon deficits is the santista output brands hatch 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.099
 is the blood terry hall area 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.409
 notice that we have there the heart's not sandy exit has the arteries 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.110
 and until the entrance of the blood by cbv and in its heart 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.699
 then the emptiness that reaches the heart of Mary 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.150
 It's a case that leaves the heart. 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.069
 it's a card 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:54.340
 and now that blood the area would have occurred in a geni pose will be taken 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:55.949
 for all losses 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.419
 of this animal's body
