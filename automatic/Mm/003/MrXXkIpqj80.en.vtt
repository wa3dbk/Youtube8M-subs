to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.479> released<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> very<00:01:28.470> beginning<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to be released at the very beginning of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
to be released at the very beginning of
August<00:01:29.369> because<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.090> soon<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.780> we

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
August because that's very soon but we

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
August because that's very soon but we
actually<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.380> no<00:01:31.590> idea<00:01:31.619> when<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> next-gen

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
actually have no idea when the next-gen

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.550 
actually have no idea when the next-gen
versions<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> Minecraft<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.470> be

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
versions of Minecraft are going to be
released<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.790> it'll<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.119> somewhere

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
released but I think it'll be somewhere

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.120 
released but I think it'll be somewhere
in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> middle<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> month<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> therefore

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
in the middle of the month and therefore

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
in the middle of the month and therefore
I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.909> type<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.119> update<00:01:39.329> 17<00:01:39.960> will<00:01:40.200> be

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
I think that type of update 17 will be

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
I think that type of update 17 will be
released<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.890> couple<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.340> days<00:01:41.549> after<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.509> maybe

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
released a couple of days after or maybe

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.109 
released a couple of days after or maybe
even<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> same<00:01:43.500> day<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.159> therefore<00:01:44.670> my

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
even on the same day so therefore my

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.719 
even on the same day so therefore my
speculation<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> title<00:01:46.649> update<00:01:46.890> 17<00:01:47.490> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
speculation is that title update 17 is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.249 
speculation is that title update 17 is
going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.180> released<00:01:48.479> somewhere<00:01:48.990> between

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
going to be released somewhere between

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.550 
going to be released somewhere between
August<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> 15th<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.939> August<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.049> 25th

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
August the 15th and August the 25th

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.069 
August the 15th and August the 25th
within<00:01:53.189> those<00:01:53.369> 10<00:01:53.729> days<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.360> last<00:01:54.570> thing<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
within those 10 days one last thing to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
within those 10 days one last thing to
mention<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> might<00:01:56.219> actually<00:01:56.250> come

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
mention is that it might actually come

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.740 
mention is that it might actually come
out<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.240> ps3<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.930> ps4<00:01:58.439> before<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.880> reaches<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
out on ps3 and ps4 before it reaches the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
out on ps3 and ps4 before it reaches the
Xbox<00:02:01.259> consoles<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> reason<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.820> is

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
Xbox consoles now the reason for that is

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.999 
Xbox consoles now the reason for that is
because<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.509> has<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:03.930> through<00:02:04.140> Microsoft

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
because it has to go through Microsoft

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.249 
because it has to go through Microsoft
certification<00:02:06.000> testing<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.960> takes

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
certification testing and that takes

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.930 
certification testing and that takes
longer<00:02:07.590> than<00:02:07.920> these<00:02:08.369> Sony's<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
longer than these Sony's the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.380 
longer than these Sony's the
certification<00:02:09.660> testing<00:02:10.050> as

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
certification testing as

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.020 
certification testing as
seen<00:02:10.630> on<00:02:10.750> previous<00:02:10.960> updates<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.190> PlayStation

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
seen on previous updates so PlayStation

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.600 
seen on previous updates so PlayStation
users<00:02:13.210> you<00:02:13.600> may<00:02:13.810> get<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.200> maybe<00:02:14.440> two<00:02:14.950> or<00:02:15.280> three

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
users you may get it maybe two or three

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.790 
users you may get it maybe two or three
days<00:02:15.819> before<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.480> Xbox<00:02:16.840> players<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.500> we<00:02:17.530> will

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
days before the Xbox players but we will

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.380 
days before the Xbox players but we will
be<00:02:17.920> getting<00:02:17.950> there<00:02:18.280> sometime<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.819> August<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
be getting there sometime in August and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.150 
be getting there sometime in August and
I'm<00:02:19.480> saying<00:02:19.840> there<00:02:20.260> will<00:02:20.350> be<00:02:20.380> somewhere<00:02:20.709> near

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
I'm saying there will be somewhere near

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160 
I'm saying there will be somewhere near
August<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.150> twentieth<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
August to the twentieth now I think the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.990 
August to the twentieth now I think the
reasoning<00:02:23.560> behind<00:02:23.680> my<00:02:23.980> guess<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.430> pretty<00:02:24.730> good

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
reasoning behind my guess is pretty good

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.850 
reasoning behind my guess is pretty good
and<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> very<00:02:26.080> good<00:02:26.319> educated

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and I think it's a very good educated

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.500 
and I think it's a very good educated
guess<00:02:27.160> but<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.730> everyone's<00:02:28.209> going<00:02:28.450> to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
guess but you know everyone's going to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.360 
guess but you know everyone's going to
think<00:02:28.750> different<00:02:29.110> things<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:30.100> let<00:02:30.250> me

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
think different things so just let me

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.830 
think different things so just let me
know<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.670> comment<00:02:31.030> section<00:02:31.330> down<00:02:31.360> below
