00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.450
 experiment 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.700

 Well that day to try sometime in the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.299
 When swimming you have a number of plates 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.280
 sensors in which you must be very hard 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.290
 tap the stop your time because if 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.460
 a wave of water remains 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.649
 ticking the time 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.600
 What do we swimmers from tapping 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.729
 but with this part of our hand job 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.170
 as very hard against that place and in the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.270
 split second or the supreme 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 concentration the so-called flow I knew 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.619

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.289
 these fingers with stretched fingers 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.179
 to tap 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.140
 boom I live at six hundredths of one 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.159
 second but we broke finger in sport 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.929
 monologues 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.280
 the former top athletes are renewed 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.110
 in the full spotlight of the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.289
 attention and they go again 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.840
 confrontation with their audience but now 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.360
 lower and show the coverage 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.159
 themselves in all their vulnerability in 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.460
 a split second it seemed very long 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.920
 I thought okay if I did this for half a minute 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.310

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.340

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.359
 profiles here and that came here 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.069
 almost out 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.530
 glory and sorrow stand by for a moment 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.810
 each other and that we leon those sentences 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.299

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.500
 impressive the person behind the person 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.909
 and the unexpected could actually 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.920
 darts silk flower what you actually 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.049

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.430
 arena say it is without that 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.040

 This is because you must see you on a 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.859
 very small theater 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.319
