00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.180
 anna sui 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.680
 and buy a couple of shades of varnish from anna sui 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.800
 I got interested 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.690
 colors they are unusual they have some 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.849
 interesting such glide and they are good 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.160
 lie down I realized that they have an order for 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.660
 quality I really want to try and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.189
 I'll show you the booth because he 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.070
 stands out among the rest 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.510
 and always there are a lot of people hope 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.269
 that I will be able to remove 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 so that everything can be seen on my lips 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 lip maximizer 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.600
 collagen active the most ordinary hello yet 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.719
 just look outfit on me like that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:50.489
 top it is asymmetrical here here as well 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:54.390
 from here he looks like that to me very much 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:00.870
 like and print that here 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.930
 present and we are not shorts in their saw 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.470
 I showed in one of the vlogs 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.510
 I'll often wear here such here my 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.510
 here is the feed 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 stay 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.620
 Here is the stand of an-nasai 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.780
 hard not to notice 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.900
 many believe that this cosmetics 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.030
 Japanese basically this is true because 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.040
 It is produced in Japan with 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.480
 Albion company is a fashion designer herself 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.280
 born in america although parents and and 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.710
 originally from China 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.400
 rouge I jumped them a lot 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.400
 shimmer 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.159
 in general, I don't know about rouge, I'm here 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.159
 I look more and varnishes for them it occurred 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.400
 Looks like it was close to and also 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.670
 2 watched the shadows 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.930
 they are shimmer but they have a different shimmer 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:13.100
 small and large look like this lipstick 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:17.330
 and varnishes 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.080
 Now I will look at the large varnish 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.620
 there is a choice 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.640
 with a glossy finish glitter with some 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.160
 interspersed with sequins with me 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.180
 the threads you liked the most 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.180
 just unusual 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.810
 But pay attention to the girls on their 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.810
 manicure they also have such interesting varnishes 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.950
 I think that she is also lucky for her son 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:01.050
 consultant exactly look like this 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:03.150
 swatches of shadows and this powder with such 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.630
 lid me certainly not a fan of such 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:12.170
 but I think someone like that will be in 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:16.340
 delighted here are plastic packaging 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.340
 purple puff 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.040
 I do not know how to design cosmetics but design 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.210
 vials for lifting she forces 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.090
 develops herself 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.070
 as they say about this parfum release 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.070
 together with the German company wella 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.209
 you 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.870
 except shadows and varnishes, I did not look 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.159
 lipstick didn't sound so can't 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.159
 say how they don't 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.260
 I wandered around the store clothes 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.490
 I saw here such a brand as matryoshka 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.930
 I decided to show you but such a dress 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:09.210
 so I'm at home and here is such a bag 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:14.770
 I bought two shades of lacquer and shade 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:18.580
 Now I'll show you what you think 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.880
 lacquer packaging and bag fit today to 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.470
 my style some 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.760
 It looks like a husky 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.760
 anna sui about packaging 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.639
 I bought two shades they are not fashionable 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.169
 one glider other with threads 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.180
 it looks interesting i want 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.919
 try rather on nails and at the end 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.290
 video I'll show you how it is 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.610
 looks on the nails I will erase my varnish 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.669
 me now on the nails 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.330
 I will cry Chanel I have already shown 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.330
 its in purchase 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:11.690
 so many interesting shades 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.960
 such decisions were so difficult 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.450
 I choose while I decided to take two 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.370
 different though I liked with the strings 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.520
 More color, I decided to try 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.560
 first one and then if I already 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.900
 I'll like it and buy a second shade with 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.550
 playing black lacquer 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.360
 silver or gold on me after all 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.330
 like 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:39.560
 powerful clitoris so golden and bob 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:43.510
 golden I put it in such an envelope 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.510
 I will show you a cent closer to him 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.820
 I was given in samples of baby cream spf50 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.620
 only their two shades are presented them 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.620
 can be mixed together to 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.050
 get the right shade it is very liquid 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.440
 as water but after application quickly 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.950
 dries leaves the skin semi-matte and 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.669
 as they say replaces the liquid base and 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.250
 powder at the same time and also masks 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.430
 enlarged pores moisturizes well and 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.690
 Lychee extract composition and 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.690
 ideal for oily skin 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.930
 eyeshadow 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.840
 very small here one gram + they 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.680
 cream i think they are so fast 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:37.890
 end I didn't take the cases you saw on 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.510
 video as they look not so style and 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:44.120
 grace I liked the quality itself 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.120
 shadows to this I did not take the case 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.370
 these shadows fit well and hold and 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.510
 no base but they are not heavily pigmented 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.240
 it seemed to me 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.780
 they give a light glow and some kind of glare 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.780
 for centuries 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.660
 these are better not to use shadows without 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.710
 bases because they are instant 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:12.040
 roll down but they look beautiful 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.080
 evening afternoon too large shimmer a 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.620
 in the evening it's just awesome 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.620
 looks like 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:23.400
 In principle, it seems that they are similar but 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:27.150
 I have a different glow, I just could not 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:30.330
 choose one of the two decided to buy two 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.300
 the more here is a small amount I think 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:37.139
 that they end quickly but they me 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.550
 really liked these were mine 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:42.240
 I hope you were interested in shopping 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:45.229
 such a video of a good day beautiful 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.229
 mood bye bye
