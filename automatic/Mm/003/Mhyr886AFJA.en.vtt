show you creeper now this one's the best
I<00:03:59.819> think<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.449> because<00:04:00.599> it's<00:04:01.199> like<00:04:01.530> yeah<00:04:02.310> i'm

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
I think just because it's like yeah i'm

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.159 
I think just because it's like yeah i'm
a<00:04:02.639> creeper<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.030> current<00:04:03.389> that<00:04:03.690> can't<00:04:03.930> hurt

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
a creeper the current that can't hurt

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.110 
a creeper the current that can't hurt
you<00:04:04.379> at<00:04:04.620> all<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.190> right<00:04:05.579> next<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.909> you

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
and I think people besides myself can

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.259 
and I think people besides myself can
find<00:04:10.109> this<00:04:10.229> really<00:04:10.530> useful<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.459> different

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
find this really useful in different

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.939 
find this really useful in different
types<00:04:12.419> of<00:04:12.599> like<00:04:12.750> adventure<00:04:13.260> mass<00:04:13.440> stuff<00:04:13.799> like

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
types of like adventure mass stuff like
