00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.900
 so decided to 50 volts I had 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.510
 I believe he had that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.530
 ran smoothly 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:11.440
 a little too much on the kotti 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:11.440
 played around and very warm 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.250
 schwenker has looked quite as if 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.140
 well and good possibility around 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.020
 to get out again then actually 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.690
 is wrapped when it is here in the small 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.860
 that's how beautiful it works 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.200
 the transistors it has me 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:43.130
 probably a transistor so all 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:44.600
 three by celebrated that looked good 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.369
 wandering apart 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:54.159
 not much to be so small 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:54.159
 is the controller for turnips 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.670
 the riddle is unfortunately different than 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 what am I doing with my stepper motor off 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 That's why it will not work 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.500
 So the winding is still ok 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.180
 because I just tested 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.030
 the habs but not performed 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.620
 then transistors to stop again a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.910
 certain speed got out 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.230
 you can do that through high tension 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.780
 but a little better and bigger 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.580
 I wrapped the sample around 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.150
 that was an old buddy 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.860
 been 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.510
 normal for 220 volt every school with 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.030
 two can occur in parallel therefore we can 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.470
 quite a lot here this is the result 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 So I do not have to go together yet 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.590
 Divorce as we come to the actual 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:51.500
 problem and sword I have everything where 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.830
 machine winding machine computer blabla 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.760
 entrÃ©e machine is still missing me 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.430
 Maybe it's not that bad 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.019
 because if I had everything here 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.320
 Of course I make him videos and there 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:10.050
 ask who this does not bother much 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:12.450
 would become a wave with anchor 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.380
 so choose from stainless steel 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.630
 wenz opponent 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.630
 the exact dimensions are now here 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.170
 and the rotor should if possible 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.150
 aluminum 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.209
 i believe aluminum we go too 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.060
 of course, something nice would be something nice 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.640
 completely a metallic somehow 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.200
 plastic pvc or what do I know what receives 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.390
 then everything has such a nice tilt where you can 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.930
 can make of it so then I want 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.569
 Just a rotor for that 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.700
 surname as well as this stepper motor 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:03.349
 built with her many little ones 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.349
 magnets are recessed here 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:21.959
 I put it to good use once 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:24.510
 right now I hope that 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.050
 Great then it works like that too 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.430
 small and the problem in the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.820
 Control that if we too 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.820
 somehow solve
