00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello guys and welcome one more day to 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.820
 channel today what we are going to do is one day 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.500
 just as a god is a thing that 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.719
 I think he's losing more and more 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.610
 and it's the photographs and it's that we're 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.710
 a bit in the digital age and with the 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.690
 excuse that with the mobile because it is already worth 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.550
 that we get all digital we have it in 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.349
 computer and with excuse that always what 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.029
 we have here we can see it again what 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.400
 we can hang on instagram on facebook 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.779
 let's say we can share it because 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.609
 does not create so much interest the fact 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.320
 reveal it and I think a photograph is 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.329
 a nice memory to have it in a format 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.070
 paper is much better and I do not know 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.289
 much prettier so what I'm going to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.510
 are two ways to put 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.460
 our photos without it in a way 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.109
 very conventional and taking advantage that I'm going 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.120
 to live outside with my boyfriend and not yet 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.010
 We had no type of photo and given that 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.570
 last trip so pretty special 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.309
 for us because some of these 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.930
 photographs that help with the trip and with 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.489
 the mobile has led to printing and 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.469
 let's put the house with a little bit of 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.920
 memories already so I hope you like it 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.600
 and we start with the video 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.579
 and these are some of the photos that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.559
 chose from the trip I love that you have 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.850
 a large blank frame because in 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.530
 reality because very much love the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.090
 Photography 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.180
 we're going to need a framework 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.640
 photographs a ball of yarn pincers 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.880
 wood and something for the subject either 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.680
 zeal to a tape or glue just me 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.930
 interest the frame itself so I'm going to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.850
 take out all the rest I take away the part 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.430
 from behind the glass and the folio that it carries 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.840
 inside I only stay with the outside the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 first frame what I have done is catch 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 the photographs that represent something that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.690
 we do not necessarily have to leave the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.700
 two simply because it's a moment a 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.790
 object that represent a story in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.380
 I'll cut the trip a little bit 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.300
 so that it is a little more framed 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.330
 and they fit more but I want to continue leaving 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.940
 a white margin 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.800
 now we take the ball and tie it in 2 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.780
 filler as here if you want you can use 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 glue or some kind of nail but 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.290
 I did not see it too sure either, so 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.600
 decided to make it a little simpler than 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.610
 just make a knot and made two 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.680
 rows and in each row put three 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.240
 Photographs 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.860
 first I wanted to do it with the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.020
 wooden clamps but I've seen that two 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.179
 rows with wooden clothespins will stay 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.640
 too small everything will be very 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.530
 plumb but it would be perfect is what 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.960
 that makes a row of three you can also 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.960
 use clips smaller clips or zeal 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.790
 and the result with the tweezers I love 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.100
 but I tell you only if it was with a 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.500
 purpose of three photographs being of 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.390
 six I think it was too small like that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.300
 that at the end of opted to put it with 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.640
 a tape once done you have many 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.530
 possibilities to decorate it I have tried 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.480
 to cover everything with the ball and that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.850
 I made it beautiful I loved it but the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.470
 truth is that I was left without ball and already 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.180
 I could not go out and buy more so 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.920
 I chose to remove it but one day 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.920
 I will surely finish it 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.970
 and the next one is even simpler let's go 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.450
 to need a branch a stick like 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.060
 ye call skein pictures 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.500
 and the adhesive tape first we go to 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.330
 do the same as in the previous one we're going 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.370
 to cut out the photos a little bit for 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.050
 frame them I will be tying pieces of 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.060
 balls of different sizes for 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.100
 place the photographs you can put 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.200
 both one and two in the same piece 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.990
 ball is very nice and you can do 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.760
 many rows and opted to do it from 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.470
 different size and interspersed there 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.680
 also putting in some two 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.230
 Photographs 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.060
 to hang it what I have done is to pass 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.939
 the ball by place to make a knot 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.750
 just pass it and tie the end with 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.750
 a sliding knot 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.090
 it looks very nice it 's very economical and it's 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.950
 different from a simple frame and now only 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.950
 I have to think about where I am going to place it 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.280
 and for the last one we're going to need 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.530
 also two clew sticks and the tongs of 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.600
 wood this one is also super easy 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.730
 we just have to put the two together 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.650
 sticks with the ball and in the pieces of 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.650
 the strings we can put pictures 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.510
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.040
 the video that gives you ideas to do 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.140
 your own frames a little 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.310
 different from the conventional ones and if 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.260
 do some do not forget 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.180
 share it via facebook via twitter 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.250
 for me to see them and not tweet the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.959
 that gives me a lot of hope so I 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.729
 dismissal for today see you on Sunday 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.889
 there I just wanted to remember those who already 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.150
 I have the winner of the draw and that the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.150
 Sunday video I'll say it
