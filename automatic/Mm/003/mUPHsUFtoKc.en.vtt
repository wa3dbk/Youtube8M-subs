00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.710
 or the truth today I bring you my 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.450
 favorites of this month and I will go with 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.879
 the masks depress that they are 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.679
 paper masks and these come in 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.079
 this presentation and I have the one 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.909
 cucumber and the guatapÃ© but these 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.830
 masks I like the fact that 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.110
 they have a lot more variety in that 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.240
 to these paper and which to me more 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.030
 like is the one that I do not have right now because 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.100
 obviously she fits me and this is the 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.440
 of blue agave and this mask is 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.230
 moisturizer I really feel that I 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.850
 It hydrates my skin very much. I use it 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.039
 once a week that's when I do my 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.440
 Deep exfoliation and I really feel 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.319
 that the formula that has that mask 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.749
 it's pretty penetrating and I 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:46.569
 as I am of mixed skin oily skin 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:51.720
 I feel more need to moisturize and the 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:53.700
 that to wet it if you understand me 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.110
 this back illuminator played the 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.870
 Fergie's line has been another 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.930
 recent discovery and this is called 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
 rose jumping loud when I bought it 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.970
 I did usual and sincerely I did not 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.340
 impressed a lot so I think I use it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.410
 like two or three times and then what 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.150
 I kept I do not know where and I forgot 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.580
 completely from her just in a blog 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.920
 of and that this one was comparing it with 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.780
 a branded product which not again 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 I'm sure it's completely 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.790
 true but it definitely woke me up 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 the curiosity to try it again myself 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.690
 I use it on the cheekbones on the bridge of the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.550
 nose on the lips my next 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.460
 favorite although it is within the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.010
 makeup products for the face no 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.020
 it's specifically for the face but so 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.840
 it's like I've been using it and it's the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 hyper lifting in general and this side is 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.790
 a nude color and the function of this one is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.300
 as to light the eyebrows to 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.640
 highlight the best and the brown side is for 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.590
 fill your eyebrow but I do not use the side 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 coffee for that not that I have not been 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.710
 using to outline because I feel that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.350
 It gives a more look 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.530
 to your makeup than when you do it with 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.440
 only dust as for the eyes 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 this product of giorgana sincerely 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.410
 it's an amazing thing them that every 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.030
 Once I talk about a product in my 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.680
 favorite I say it's amazing but it's 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.709
 that's why I have my favorites 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.170
 call to our make there are already thought and 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.480
 the name is continuous to the peanut this is the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.270
 pop lotion version in nix shows 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.520
 that you can use them as a basis for your 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.680
 shadows but still our pop in shows 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.080
 the next are not long-term you have 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.810
 that you get a very good pre base for 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.570
 that you do not run and these are not these 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.880
 they are definitely long-lasting and 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.950
 I can not tell you how amazing this is 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.320
 product some two that have 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.080
 compared to the mac pipe and really 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.220
 I can not tell you how much I have loved 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.650
 these viles are the maximum they have very 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.420
 little pigmentation but that's not the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.550
 why I love him so much 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.280
 until the menthol sensation in my 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.910
 lips especially true right now in 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.040
 this cold that really does make me 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.349
 love the original less baby 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.750
 but I really like these still 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.130
 much more than the originals because 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.260
 I feel that the originals my several 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.360
 we are absorbing as well as these 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.790
 those of doctors that I really loved 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.610
 that line that this eyeliner 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.769
 jordan to that although I barely bought it 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.860
 About a week or two weeks ago 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.840
 I really can not tell you how happy 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.630
 that I have found this 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.269
 eyeliner because these are like almost of 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.880
 199 euros and Palestinian and the color is 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.120
 meat but what makes me happiest is 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.340
 the fact that this one is equal to black 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.620
 decker and milan and that every time I 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.540
 I get black eyed from Milan and all the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.799
 Everyone asks me that brings on the lips 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.720
 and many of you get sad 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.580
 because they say they do not get milan and 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.560
 where they live but if you can 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.870
 get your win you can get 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.630
 this color and it is exactly the same 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.670
 you know how much I put it on I thought I'm going to 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.450
 decide running the gossip girls and 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.310
 obviously 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.800
 then on the lips right now as for 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.230
 the texture and that's how it is eyeliner 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.720
 it's a little drier so it's about 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.790
 use a lip balm I feel like it's going 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.459
 very good hand but must athens 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.440
 This color is sent with this color 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.660
 and especially because you know that I 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.520
 love to see me as a vampire as well as the 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.169
 world tells me that I look like a vampire and if 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.169
 I love fascinates me thank you 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.320
 and already to finish you know that I can not 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.290
 leave the products of the nails outside 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.570
 I'm fond of glazes and if 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.789

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.419

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.729

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.580

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.970
 mystic green and this one is mailing and the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.010
 effect of this enamel is holographic and 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.680
