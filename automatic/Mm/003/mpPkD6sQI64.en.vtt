00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.129 
know most people point to the finger
poke<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.130> doom<00:00:08.400> but<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.730> still<00:00:09.540> feel<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:09.900> it

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
poke of doom but I still feel that it

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.270 
poke of doom but I still feel that it
wasn't<00:00:10.440> too<00:00:10.559> late<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:10.860> them<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.070> turn<00:00:11.219> it

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
wasn't too late for them to turn it

wasn't too late for them to turn it
around<00:00:11.550> at<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.849> point<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.240> always<00:00:12.389> felt<00:00:12.750> that

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
around at that point I always felt that

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.160 
around at that point I always felt that

Jericho<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.789> kind<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> first<00:00:51.300> blow<00:00:51.660> like

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
Jericho was kind of the first blow like

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
Jericho was kind of the first blow like
that<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.680> he<00:00:52.800> showed<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that when he showed up and then the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.369 
that when he showed up and then the
radical<00:00:53.699> showed<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> few<00:00:54.570> months<00:00:54.840> later<00:00:55.079> all

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
radical showed up a few months later all

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.810 
radical showed up a few months later all
at<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> same<00:00:56.190> time<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:58.109> argue<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.829> still

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
at the same time I would argue it still

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
at the same time I would argue it still
could<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.180> saved<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> point<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
could have been saved at that point I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.700 
could have been saved at that point I
think<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:02.460> still<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.149> chance<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.930> them

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
think there was still a chance for them

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.149 
think there was still a chance for them
to<00:01:04.739> survive<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> point<00:01:05.790> until<00:01:07.070> April<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
to survive at that point until April of

to survive at that point until April of
2000<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.380> brought<00:01:10.409> back
