performance so as you can see this is

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.319 
performance so as you can see this is
just<00:03:41.919> a<00:03:42.010> kind<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.370> standard<00:03:42.879> footbed<00:03:43.299> that

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
just a kind of a standard footbed that

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.839 
just a kind of a standard footbed that
comes<00:03:43.690> in<00:03:43.870> two<00:03:43.959> skates<00:03:44.229> it's<00:03:44.500> really<00:03:45.159> you<00:03:45.760> know

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
comes in two skates it's really you know

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.909 
comes in two skates it's really you know
pretty<00:03:46.090> basic<00:03:46.329> most<00:03:47.319> when<00:03:47.500> we<00:03:47.530> were<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.709> foam

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
pretty basic most when we were a foam

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.559 
pretty basic most when we were a foam
material<00:03:48.099> that<00:03:48.579> don't<00:03:48.909> offer<00:03:49.150> as<00:03:49.329> much

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569
