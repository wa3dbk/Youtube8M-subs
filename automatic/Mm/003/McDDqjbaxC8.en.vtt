purists<00:00:29.010> when<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> first<00:00:29.939> went<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.359> California

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
purists when I first went to California

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
purists when I first went to California
when<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.410> seven<00:00:31.800> years<00:00:31.830> old<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.579> ate<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
when I was seven years old I ate a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.350 
when I was seven years old I ate a
tangerine<00:00:34.079> off<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> tree<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
tangerine off the tree and I think that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.569 
tangerine off the tree and I think that
is<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.809> triggering<00:00:37.620> moment<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.250> got<00:00:38.399> me

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is the triggering moment that got me

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.810 
is the triggering moment that got me
into<00:00:38.790> natural<00:00:38.940> foods<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:40.129> raw<00:00:41.129> food<00:00:41.370> diet<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
into natural foods a raw food diet is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.750 
into natural foods a raw food diet is
basically<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> night<00:00:42.570> made<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.710> raw<00:00:44.370> nuts

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
basically a night made up of raw nuts

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.750 
basically a night made up of raw nuts
seeds<00:00:45.350> sprouted<00:00:46.350> grains<00:00:46.649> fruits<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
seeds sprouted grains fruits and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.420 
seeds sprouted grains fruits and
vegetables<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.320> means<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> food<00:00:50.280> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
vegetables and it means that the food is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
vegetables and it means that the food is
unprocessed<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.809> cooked<00:00:52.050> we

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
unprocessed and it's not cooked we

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.959 
unprocessed and it's not cooked we
dehydrate<00:00:52.949> some<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> foods<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:53.879> we

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
dehydrate some of the foods when we

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.569 
dehydrate some of the foods when we
don't<00:00:54.120> dehydrate<00:00:54.270> them<00:00:54.690> over<00:00:55.530> 125<00:00:56.219> degrees

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
don't dehydrate them over 125 degrees

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.479 
don't dehydrate them over 125 degrees
and<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.449> point<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.129> cook

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and the point for that is to not cook

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.670 
and the point for that is to not cook
the<00:00:59.910> enzymes<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.899> food<00:01:01.079> when<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the enzymes out of the food when you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680 
the enzymes out of the food when you
cook<00:01:01.859> food<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.370> kill<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> enzyme<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.510> kill

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
cook food you kill the enzyme to kill

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.149 
cook food you kill the enzyme to kill
the<00:01:03.840> vitamins<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> kill<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> nutrients<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the vitamins you kill the nutrients you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.950 
the vitamins you kill the nutrients you
kill<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> minerals<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:06.869> body

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
kill all the minerals and so your body

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.070 
kill all the minerals and so your body

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
emotionally I feel happier people come

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.400 
emotionally I feel happier people come
up<00:02:30.549> with<00:02:30.790> all<00:02:30.880> these<00:02:31.019> amazingly<00:02:32.019> interesting

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
up with all these amazingly interesting

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.520 
up with all these amazingly interesting
scientific<00:02:33.250> explanations<00:02:34.209> as<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.480> why<00:02:34.600> raw

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
scientific explanations as to why raw

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.350 
scientific explanations as to why raw
food<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.010> better<00:02:36.160> than<00:02:36.370> cooked<00:02:36.610> food<00:02:36.819> but<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
food is better than cooked food but the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.690 
food is better than cooked food but the
obvious<00:02:37.810> reason<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.799> it<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.280> has<00:02:39.400> water

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
obvious reason is that it just has water

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.509 
obvious reason is that it just has water
in<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.060> has<00:02:40.299> juice<00:02:41.010> people<00:02:42.010> want<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.370> more

juicy<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.390> only<00:02:43.480> way<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.900> get<00:02:44.290> more

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.160 
juicy and the only way you can get more
juicy<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.970> juice<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.510> your<00:02:46.540> tissues

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
juicy have that juice in your tissues

that<00:02:47.709> bounce<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.519> by<00:02:49.090> taking<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.690> juice

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
that bounce is by taking in juice

that bounce is by taking in juice
drinking<00:02:50.769> juice<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:51.250> but<00:02:52.030> where<00:02:52.180> are<00:02:52.239> you
