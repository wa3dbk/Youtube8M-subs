heavier<00:01:56.740> lock<00:01:58.020> whatever<00:01:59.020> your<00:01:59.200> line<00:01:59.380> on

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.910 

I<00:02:03.460> saw<00:02:04.120> him<00:02:04.330> come<00:02:04.510> right<00:02:04.690> off<00:02:04.840> background

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.800 

Shimano<00:02:10.610> cron<00:02:11.030> work<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.569> awesome<00:02:14.569> when<00:02:14.720> it

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
Shimano cron work is so awesome when it

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.730 
Shimano cron work is so awesome when it
comes<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.180> easy<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.600> your<00:02:17.810> hands<00:02:18.290> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.380 

it's<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.750> white<00:02:38.200> as<00:02:38.380> he<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.680> long<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.880> 14

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
it's just white as he is long this 14

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.620 
it's just white as he is long this 14
inches<00:02:40.690> long<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.880> fish<00:02:43.090> love<00:02:43.270> those<00:02:43.450> looks

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
inches long the fish love those looks

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.720 
inches long the fish love those looks
it's<00:02:46.630> like<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.810> brick<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:51.190> fish<00:02:51.460> that<00:02:51.640> I

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
it's like a brick that fish that I

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's like a brick that fish that I
missed<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.150> spinnerbait<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.870> previous

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
fish I made it I made a really big

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.980 
fish I made it I made a really big
mistake<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.620> boat<00:02:56.830> handling<00:02:57.570> when<00:02:58.570> your<00:02:58.750> River

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
mistake in boat handling when your River

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.230 
mistake in boat handling when your River
fishing<00:02:59.320> typically<00:03:00.220> boats<00:03:00.490> in<00:03:00.670> fast<00:03:00.940> water

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
fishing typically boats in fast water

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.760 
fishing typically boats in fast water
and<00:03:01.510> I'm<00:03:01.600> laying<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.050> spinner<00:03:02.380> bait<00:03:02.620> in

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
and I'm laying this spinner bait in

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.550 
and I'm laying this spinner bait in
pocket<00:03:03.250> water<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.510> those<00:03:04.720> those<00:03:05.050> fish<00:03:05.410> are

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
pocket water so those those fish are

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.050 
pocket water so those those fish are
hitting<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.980> really<00:03:06.100> hard<00:03:06.460> and<00:03:06.730> they<00:03:06.850> come

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
hitting it really hard and they come

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.710 
hitting it really hard and they come
flying<00:03:07.630> out<00:03:08.050> into<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.440> current<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.720> they're

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
flying out into the current and they're

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.390 
flying out into the current and they're
automatically<00:03:11.290> down<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.830> your<00:03:11.980> fight<00:03:12.250> and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
automatically down in your fight and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.310 
automatically down in your fight and
fish<00:03:12.580> end<00:03:12.820> current<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.630> lot<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.840> times<00:03:14.140> all

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
fish end current and a lot of times all

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.600 
fish end current and a lot of times all
they'll<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.710> is<00:03:14.740> they'll<00:03:14.980> just<00:03:15.160> keep<00:03:15.340> going

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
they'll do is they'll just keep going

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.890 
they'll do is they'll just keep going
like<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.030> they'll<00:03:16.210> be<00:03:16.300> shaking<00:03:16.720> their

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
like that and they'll be shaking their

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.720 
like that and they'll be shaking their
head<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.320> they'll<00:03:17.710> pop<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.190> spinner<00:03:18.490> bait

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
head and they'll pop that spinner bait

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.440 
head and they'll pop that spinner bait
and<00:03:20.280> I've<00:03:21.280> learned<00:03:21.580> over<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.970> years<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.300> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
and I've learned over the years that the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.180 
and I've learned over the years that the
best<00:03:22.480> way<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.870> get<00:03:23.080> around<00:03:23.380> losing<00:03:23.620> fish<00:03:23.980> like

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
best way to get around losing fish like

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.640 
best way to get around losing fish like
that<00:03:24.220> is<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.610> just<00:03:24.640> drop<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.240> boat<00:03:25.420> back<00:03:25.690> you

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
that is it just drop the boat back you

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.050 
that is it just drop the boat back you
know<00:03:26.740> take<00:03:26.920> my<00:03:27.160> foot<00:03:27.310> off<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.640> trolling<00:03:27.910> motor

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
know take my foot off the trolling motor

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.240 
know take my foot off the trolling motor
and<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.600> let<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.900> sag<00:03:29.290> back<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.920> fish<00:03:30.130> a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
and just let it sag back to the fish a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.060 
and just let it sag back to the fish a
little<00:03:30.370> bit<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:31.510> will<00:03:31.830> eliminate<00:03:32.830> some

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
little bit and that will eliminate some

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.530 
little bit and that will eliminate some
of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.400> tension<00:03:33.760> on<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:33.970> fish<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.390> fish

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
of the tension on the fish and the fish

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.150 
of the tension on the fish and the fish
will<00:03:34.720> sometimes<00:03:35.170> have<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.380> tendency<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.890> kind

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
will sometimes have a tendency to kind

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160 
will sometimes have a tendency to kind
of<00:03:36.280> go<00:03:36.550> down<00:03:36.760> under<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.540> surface<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.050> you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
of go down under the surface and you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.660 
of go down under the surface and you
have<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.320> better<00:03:38.500> opportunity<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.220> land<00:03:39.490> that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
have a better opportunity to land that

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.570 
have a better opportunity to land that
fish<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.210> way<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:41.620> did<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:41.980> on<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.190> second

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
fish that way and I did it on the second

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.230 
fish that way and I did it on the second
fish<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.250> see<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.610> results<00:03:46.090> were

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
fish and as you can see the results were

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.840 
fish and as you can see the results were
a<00:03:46.270> little<00:03:46.480> bit<00:03:46.720> better<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:48.400> that's<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.700> good

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
a little bit better so that's a good

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.300 
a little bit better so that's a good
technique<00:03:49.270> when<00:03:49.480> you're<00:03:49.630> fishing<00:03:50.160> with<00:03:51.160> the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
technique when you're fishing with the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.960 
technique when you're fishing with the
boat<00:03:51.490> positioned<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.240> fast<00:03:52.600> water<00:03:53.460> in<00:03:54.460> a<00:03:54.790> river

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
boat positioned in fast water in a river

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.040 
boat positioned in fast water in a river
situation<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:57.010> I'll<00:03:57.100> tell<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.460> it's<00:03:58.020> on<00:03:59.020> a

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
situation and I'll tell you it's on a

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.340 
situation and I'll tell you it's on a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
tough bite day like today every little

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.710 
tough bite day like today every little
bit<00:04:02.470> helps<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:03.070> learn<00:04:03.670> from<00:04:03.700> your<00:04:04.090> mistakes<00:04:04.510> in

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
the past and make sure I had to make

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.870 
the past and make sure I had to make
sure<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.080> implemented<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.860> one<00:04:09.070> I<00:04:09.310> can't

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
sure I implemented that one I can't

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.870 
sure I implemented that one I can't
afford<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.240> lose<00:04:10.360> fish<00:04:10.660> today
