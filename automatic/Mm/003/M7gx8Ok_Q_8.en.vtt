00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
always look for is OBO sometimes they'll

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.080 
always look for is OBO sometimes they'll
put<00:01:09.810> $3,000<00:01:10.740> OBO<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.400> whatever<00:01:11.670> their<00:01:11.880> price

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
is and then OBO

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.640 
is and then OBO
so<00:01:13.890> when<00:01:14.040> OBO<00:01:14.369> tells<00:01:14.790> me<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.439> sellers<00:01:16.439> are

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
so when OBO tells me is that sellers are
