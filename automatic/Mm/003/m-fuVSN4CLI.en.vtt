I was really upset with the card I was

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
I was really upset with the card I was
just<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.379> disagreement<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.460> call

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
just the disagreement with the one call

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
just the disagreement with the one call
because<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:54.899> looking<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.500> running

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
because I was looking at the one running

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.729 
because I was looking at the one running
back<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> inside<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:58.590> was

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
back that was on the inside and he was

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
back that was on the inside and he was
getting<00:00:58.890> jammed<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> line<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
getting jammed at the line so then I

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.459 
getting jammed at the line so then I
thought<00:01:00.449> that's<00:01:00.629> who<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:00.989> calling<00:01:01.350> on
