00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 is the risk of losing it 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.510
 this is the selection 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.080
 pesic and flights 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.389
 to use on rocks all work here on points 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.149
 and we do not know why barriers bar anywhere and I know they will work 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.169
 but I'll show you some this is one of my favorites 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.130
 so if what it takes 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 15 centimeters 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.609
 subtract soils made in australia excellent decoy look a lot like 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.219
 a mullet the big fish prefer to be the big ones so if they want a 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.219
 big fish just in one like this 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 this is the segment barta detained - a 20 plus is a decoy of depth 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.850
 average 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.330
 it descends to more than 20 feet or 6 meters 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.800
 these are only the strong 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 beautiful fluorescent pink they call it elton john and it's good at high tide 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.320
 to fish on top of the rocks that is best suited for these situations 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.910
 this other century 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 this embezzlement boiled leger and scorpion 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.620
 12 points pension 5 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.630
 called the 125 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.649
 three hooks beautiful bright golden color 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.459
 this one has in three varieties is simply a meter because it says a 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:19.590
 metro here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 i can reach a meter deep 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.490
 It is very good when the agreement is deep and in places where there are rocks and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.420
 it can be good for / when three helmets arboletes four teams of 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.190
 bait 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.520
 it's a good website 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.290
 one of my favorites is mister otermÃ­n de vÃ­ctor is excellent these 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.720
 colors are villages, fresh water and in places with rocks like tun marmosets 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.180
 it's excellent 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.900
 it is known that it can catch 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.790
 all type 3 / 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.650
 former cast 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.999
 it's not very town 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.640
 throwing the central 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.760
 this is a very good sequel is the flat rat 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.810
 see this great game when it floats like this and if it hits a rock it is not 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.380
 bad phase in both the rhythm that in the central 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.920
 this coupling test is incredible 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 the hooks are small but at the same time strong and that's why the barbs come in 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.599
 easily is an excellent 'flight for inexperienced' series 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:21.010
 this is a very popular one at the high end and they surely fail 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 is the concorde bomber he produces a sound listen 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.689
 despite the floors 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.959
 run the surface and it pleases the vine when it feeds from the shore 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.259
 It balances very well and is green phosphorescent so it works in water 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.259
 cloudy like golden 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.079
 this is the maritime neighborhood 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.419
 designed in australia in that chromed finish 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.739
 very very good and the rocks and on the famous rivers 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.390
 a lure that runs well 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.479
 two hooks very valuable 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.819
 very popular with beginners you can not have box of decoys uu 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.389
 Finally 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.489
 are these two these lures 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.179
 made of soft plastic almost eat 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.760
 not only to the ground very heavy lead heads 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.189
 I have all sizes but there are others, these are sep 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.599
 a good set was what allows you to fish by layers and textiles 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.369
 so that you can plant 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:29.139
 the hook and it's sunken will dilate your life when you have a long and will continue 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:29.969
 swimming 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.970
 if the loose the street again will follow its course a relief through 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.860
 that allows you to fish in an area where you are not sure if there are fish and food 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.860
 each level of depth without moving the pot 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.889
 we were there 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.889
 trying luck 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.749
 We knew there were many / 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.199
 all along the coastline 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.319
 the rocks runs is great so we think we'll have to move 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.809
 when descending the tide 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.420
 using lures that run on the surface 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 just remember 100 meters typical com / 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.439
 return flush with salt water 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.969
 they are not excellent 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.559
 1 I must admit 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:28.240
 hampton 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.240
 this text to give us many are really struggling 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.650
 you have to store 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.650
 of the salty multi-salt vine 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.249
 look at the mornings 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.819
 because he is fighting very hard 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.750
 aa bean and that we see you then lose weight spit the lure do 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.020
 I dont know 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.279
 yes i have said it before ap 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.809
 but they caught barraza 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.409
 It is one of the best things 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.129
 what can happen to you 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.330
 when they spit the decoy, this first attempt 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.170
 but that's the whit simply irak to beat them 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.779
 We are in the final 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.909
 there is a small stream that wants to fish 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.999
 and the tide is very low so we have worked the entire dome 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.979
 the experts have failed 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.210
 with the tide and we finished 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.210
 this is to refresh stop a little 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.210
 efe / the Barranquilla fishing season is the one above 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.569
 it is not easy to arrive and the reason for it 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.749
 is why it is in poor condition 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:03.689
 this obviously a network 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.710
 john pescatore activa 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.710
 and can not each intentionally 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.189
 because obviously what favors the development 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.350
 is that they work 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.839
 legally 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.139
 they are people who suffer 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.689
 they do not need to fish illegally 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.830
 but the sad 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.490
 that a network like this 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.599
 like the one we have here 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.999
 surely they do work 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.960
 it is called 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.099
 they are not clear 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.189
 and the fish that are trapped in it 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.189
 Russia is totally shattered 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.969
 they will stay here by iran 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.039
 we gave a couple of troops we are sure there is something 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.879
 and we will register 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.879
 and if there is something 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.770
 what we will do is 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.319
 get them out of there 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.699
 I need help 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.699
 let's martÃ­n help him 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.479
 I could say that this request 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.069
 this one is by your side 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.360
 because this network is totally destroyed 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.360
 I can not break the bad balls and the good ones leave the house 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.439
 there is 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.499
 for this stretch 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:20.719
 a small dui boat 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:22.009
 and of course 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.300
 that these networks are designed 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.919
 illustrated 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:26.490
 is here
