because we're going to tie off this wick
at<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.930> top<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:42.470> that<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.710> when<00:01:43.160> we<00:01:43.280> pour<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
at the top so that it when we pour the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.060 
at the top so that it when we pour the
wax<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:44.120> stays<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.720> center<00:01:45.080> so<00:01:45.410> I'm<00:01:45.920> going

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
wax it stays in the center so I'm going

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.950 
wax it stays in the center so I'm going
to<00:01:46.130> give<00:01:46.250> myself<00:01:46.460> some<00:01:46.760> extra<00:01:48.520> space<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.970> it's

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
to give myself some extra space and it's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.450 
to give myself some extra space and it's
going<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.170> hold<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.500> wick<00:01:51.650> in<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.010> center

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
going to hold the wick in the center

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.510 
going to hold the wick in the center
that<00:01:53.420> looks<00:01:53.690> about<00:01:53.840> right<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.979> check<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.430> the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
that looks about right so check on the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.510 
that looks about right so check on the
wax<00:01:55.700> we've<00:01:56.000> got<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.270> thermometer<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.520> we'll

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
wax we've got the thermometer on we'll

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.490 
wax we've got the thermometer on we'll
just<00:01:58.550> make<00:01:58.940> sure<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.810> can<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.140> now<00:02:00.290> it's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
just make sure so you can see now it's

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.190 
just make sure so you can see now it's
completely<00:02:00.920> liquefied<00:02:01.610> there's<00:02:02.060> Neville<00:02:02.300> and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
completely liquefied there's Neville and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.600 
completely liquefied there's Neville and
it's<00:02:03.350> all<00:02:03.500> melted<00:02:03.830> down<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.160> now<00:02:04.280> what<00:02:04.490> we

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
it's all melted down and now what we

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.840 
it's all melted down and now what we
need<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.820> do<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.119> before<00:02:05.300> we<00:02:06.340> pour<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.670> need

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
need to do is before we pour it we need

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.870 
need to do is before we pour it we need
to<00:02:07.970> make<00:02:08.119> sure<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:08.630> pulls<00:02:08.959> down<00:02:09.320> too

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
to make sure that it pulls down too

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
to make sure that it pulls down too
according<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.000> these<00:02:11.090> instructions<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.810> this

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
vague about 125 Fahrenheit so you're

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.449

Leanne we hang which is a nice and so 10
drops<00:03:06.660> 10<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.050> orange<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.920> I'm<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.250> to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
drops 10 of the orange and I'm going to

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.470 
drops 10 of the orange and I'm going to
do<00:03:09.460> five<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.890> Langley<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.040> make<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.670> 15

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
do five of the Langley I to make it 15

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.900 
do five of the Langley I to make it 15
in<00:03:13.630> total<00:03:16.920> watch<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.190> edge<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.730> don't

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
in total watch the edge so you don't

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.720 
in total watch the edge so you don't
pour<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.330> right<00:03:19.510> out<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.110> shell<00:03:20.730> because

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
pour it right out of the shell because

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.600 
pour it right out of the shell because
we're<00:03:21.970> filling<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.420> deepest<00:03:22.810> part<00:03:22.930> first<00:03:23.890> and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
we're filling the deepest part first and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.020 
we're filling the deepest part first and
you're<00:03:24.910> just<00:03:25.060> going<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.300> pour<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:27.030> while

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
you're just going to pour it while

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.330 
you're just going to pour it while
centering<00:03:28.540> your<00:03:28.810> wick<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:30.070> these<00:03:30.190> will

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
centering your wick and so these will

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.730 
centering your wick and so these will
just<00:03:30.400> cool<00:03:30.730> now<00:03:30.970> for<00:03:31.240> another<00:03:31.390> 20-30<00:03:32.290> minutes

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
just cool now for another 20-30 minutes

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.990 
just cool now for another 20-30 minutes
and<00:03:32.980> then<00:03:33.490> you'll<00:03:33.640> be<00:03:33.700> able<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:34.150> unravel<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
and then you'll be able to unravel the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.180 
and then you'll be able to unravel the
chopstick<00:03:37.000> with<00:03:37.210> the<00:03:37.480> wick<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.410> then<00:03:38.710> trim<00:03:39.070> it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
chopstick with the wick and then trim it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.620 
chopstick with the wick and then trim it
just<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.550> that<00:03:39.580> there's<00:03:39.940> about<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.180> quarter<00:03:40.600> of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
just so that there's about a quarter of

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.560 
just so that there's about a quarter of
an<00:03:40.840> inch<00:03:40.990> left<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.880> you're<00:03:43.000> able<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.360> start
