looks<00:02:50.550> weird<00:02:50.790> because<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.810> characters<00:02:52.080> not

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
be appropriate to have another car tech

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.140 
be appropriate to have another car tech
and<00:04:48.140> now<00:04:48.650> it's<00:04:48.919> using

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
and now it's using

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.870 
and now it's using
now<00:04:50.780> look<00:04:50.960> at<00:04:51.050> that<00:04:51.140> animation<00:04:51.530> how<00:04:52.040> thou<00:04:52.340> you

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
now look at that animation how thou you

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.640 
now look at that animation how thou you
see<00:04:53.090> how<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:53.360> looks<00:04:53.480> like<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.900> orbs<00:04:54.470> the

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
see how it looks like the orbs the

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.180 
see how it looks like the orbs the
attack<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:55.280> mean<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.300> absorbs<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.960> butt<00:04:57.770> looks

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
attack I mean it absorbs the butt looks

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.700 
attack I mean it absorbs the butt looks
like<00:04:58.310> an<00:04:58.400> absorption<00:04:58.850> like<00:04:59.780> like<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.110> healing

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
like an absorption like like a healing

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.760 
like an absorption like like a healing
move<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.330> really<00:05:02.720> think<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:03.050> bill<00:05:03.230> oblivion

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
move so I really think a bill oblivion

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.590 
move so I really think a bill oblivion
wing<00:05:03.980> is<00:05:04.160> that<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> healing<00:05:04.970> move<00:05:05.150> as<00:05:05.330> well<00:05:05.480> as

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
wing is that a healing move as well as

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.030 
wing is that a healing move as well as
and<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.870> course<00:05:06.080> as<00:05:06.200> an<00:05:06.320> attack<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:06.800> probably

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
and of course as an attack it's probably

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.470 
and of course as an attack it's probably
going<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.220> be<00:05:07.280> like<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.430> hundred<00:05:07.790> attack<00:05:08.210> and

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
going to be like a hundred attack and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.160 
going to be like a hundred attack and
then<00:05:08.960> he'll<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:10.070> then<00:05:10.880> you<00:05:11.120> got<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.330> stab<00:05:11.870> and

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
then he'll and then you got to stab and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.960 
then he'll and then you got to stab and
then<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.410> power<00:05:12.620> boost<00:05:12.890> from<00:05:13.100> dark<00:05:13.700> aura

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
then the power boost from dark aura

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.300 
then the power boost from dark aura
that's<00:05:14.750> probably<00:05:14.990> gonna<00:05:15.110> make<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.380> like<00:05:15.470> 150

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
that's probably gonna make it like 150

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.740 
that's probably gonna make it like 150
that's<00:05:16.940> insane<00:05:18.970> but<00:05:19.970> yeah<00:05:20.150> that's<00:05:20.450> only
