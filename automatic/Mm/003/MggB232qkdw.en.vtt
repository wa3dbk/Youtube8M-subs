00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
at the goodwill bins I found this nice

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.930 
at the goodwill bins I found this nice
piece<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.140> history

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
piece of history

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.940 
piece of history
this<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.269> an<00:00:09.630> early<00:00:10.160> baby<00:00:11.160> white<00:00:11.519> container<00:00:12.950> I

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this is an early baby white container I

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.049 
this is an early baby white container I
don't<00:00:14.340> know<00:00:14.429> when<00:00:14.549> they<00:00:14.670> started<00:00:14.940> making

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
don't know when they started making

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.150 
don't know when they started making
these<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:15.900> guessing<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> 90s

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
these but I'm guessing in the 90s

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950 
these but I'm guessing in the 90s
because<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:18.000> not<00:00:18.150> ever<00:00:18.359> seen<00:00:18.690> anything

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
because I have not ever seen anything

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.269 
because I have not ever seen anything
before<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:20.270> this<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:22.100> would<00:00:23.100> be<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
before that this one would be the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.320 
before that this one would be the
mid-90s<00:00:24.230> it<00:00:25.230> has<00:00:25.800> lots<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.400> cute<00:00:26.760> characters

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
mid-90s it has lots of cute characters

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.800 
mid-90s it has lots of cute characters
on<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.840> top<00:00:28.380> cover<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.980> says<00:00:29.160> baby<00:00:29.369> fresh

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
on the top cover and it says baby fresh

I'm not sure who made this but I might

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.799 
I'm not sure who made this but I might
guess<00:00:33.000> pampers<00:00:33.480> made<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:35.750> here's<00:00:36.750> a
