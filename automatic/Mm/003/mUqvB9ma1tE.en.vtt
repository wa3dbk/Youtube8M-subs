00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
with it science nerds you have to make a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
with it science nerds you have to make a
stand<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.330> by<00:01:12.479> firing<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.110> bunch

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
stand and you do that by firing a bunch

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.679 
stand and you do that by firing a bunch
of<00:01:13.409> intergalactic<00:01:13.979> missiles<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.509> your

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
of intergalactic missiles with your

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.649 
of intergalactic missiles with your
finger<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.340> said<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.610> suspend<00:01:18.540> your

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
finger like I said just suspend your

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
finger like I said just suspend your
disbelief<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:19.530> don't<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> dick<00:01:20.610> about

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
disbelief them don't be a dick about

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.080 
disbelief them don't be a dick about
this

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.790 

now<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.180> actually<00:01:26.600> guide<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.170> missiles<00:01:27.530> by

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
now you actually guide the missiles by

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.160 
now you actually guide the missiles by
drawing<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.400> line<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.060> they<00:01:29.180> follow<00:01:29.510> said<00:01:29.960> line

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
drawing a line and they follow said line

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.870 
drawing a line and they follow said line
so<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.860> want<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.100> lead<00:01:31.280> them<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.460> little<00:01:31.760> bit

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
so you want to lead them a little bit

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.180 
so you want to lead them a little bit
ahead<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.420> moving<00:01:32.840> enemies<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.710> speaking<00:01:34.100> of

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
ahead of moving enemies and speaking of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.620 
ahead of moving enemies and speaking of
which<00:01:34.310> those<00:01:34.550> enemies<00:01:34.940> could<00:01:35.150> be<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.270> real<00:01:35.450> pain

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
which those enemies could be a real pain

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.960 
which those enemies could be a real pain
sometimes<00:01:36.020> some<00:01:36.830> of<00:01:36.920> them<00:01:37.040> shove<00:01:37.310> asteroids

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
sometimes some of them shove asteroids

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.120 
sometimes some of them shove asteroids
toward<00:01:38.390> earth<00:01:38.630> some<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:39.350> them<00:01:39.470> have<00:01:39.770> force

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
toward earth some of them have force

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.980 
toward earth some of them have force
field<00:01:40.490> some<00:01:40.850> repel<00:01:41.210> your<00:01:41.420> attacks<00:01:41.750> with

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
field some repel your attacks with

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.109 
field some repel your attacks with
magnets<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.009> most<00:01:43.190> of<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.400> enemies<00:01:43.729> required

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
magnets and most of the enemies required

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.120 
magnets and most of the enemies required
some<00:01:44.570> kind<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> special<00:01:45.290> approach<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:45.920> bring

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
some kind of special approach to bring

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.340 
some kind of special approach to bring
down<00:01:46.340> but<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.330> course<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.720> thing<00:01:47.930> with<00:01:48.170> all

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
down but of course the thing with all

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.249 
down but of course the thing with all
this<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.759> game<00:01:49.970> deducts<00:01:50.600> points<00:01:51.110> at

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
this is that the game deducts points at

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.620 
this is that the game deducts points at
the<00:01:51.440> end<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.740> each<00:01:51.830> level<00:01:52.159> if<00:01:52.640> you've<00:01:53.030> shot<00:01:53.060> too

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
the end of each level if you've shot too

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.870 
the end of each level if you've shot too
many<00:01:53.869> missiles<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:54.619> you're<00:01:55.130> encouraged<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.759> be

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
many missiles so you're encouraged to be

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.840 
many missiles so you're encouraged to be
accurate<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:56.869> use<00:01:57.619> fewer<00:01:58.070> missiles<00:01:58.610> but

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
accurate and use fewer missiles but

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.029 
accurate and use fewer missiles but
that's<00:01:59.509> kind<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.780> tough<00:01:59.960> when<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.500> also<00:02:00.740> have

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
that's kind of tough when you also have

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.580 
that's kind of tough when you also have
to<00:02:01.160> be<00:02:01.250> really<00:02:01.670> fast<00:02:02.000> if<00:02:02.360> you're<00:02:02.660> not<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:03.110> maniac

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
to be really fast if you're not a maniac

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.950 
to be really fast if you're not a maniac
with<00:02:04.160> your<00:02:04.310> missiles<00:02:04.759> if<00:02:05.210> your<00:02:05.330> planet<00:02:05.750> blows

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
with your missiles if your planet blows

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:16.360 
with your missiles if your planet blows
up<00:02:06.140> before<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.560> know<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.890> really

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
up before you know it so it's a really

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.509 
up before you know it so it's a really
challenging<00:02:16.700> game<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.989> be<00:02:18.019> honest<00:02:18.530> i<00:02:18.860> I

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
wasn't all that into it I do realize

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.250 
wasn't all that into it I do realize
this<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> solid<00:02:23.269> game<00:02:23.510> there's<00:02:23.930> nothing

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
this is a solid game there's nothing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.530 
this is a solid game there's nothing
wrong<00:02:24.380> with<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.739> at<00:02:24.830> all<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.580> just<00:02:25.640> wasn't<00:02:26.360> for

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
wrong with it at all it just wasn't for

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.710 
wrong with it at all it just wasn't for
me

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
me

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.870 
me
maybe<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:27.380> because<00:02:27.530> I'm<00:02:27.800> also<00:02:28.160> terrible<00:02:28.670> at

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
maybe it's because I'm also terrible at

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.530 
maybe it's because I'm also terrible at
it<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.209> don't<00:02:29.360> know<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.600> consider<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.680> a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
it I don't know I consider this a

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.030 
it I don't know I consider this a
subjective<00:02:32.540> criticism<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.799> found

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
subjective criticism but I found

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.060 
subjective criticism but I found
smashing<00:02:34.700> planets<00:02:35.060> more<00:02:35.799> frustrating<00:02:36.799> than

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
smashing planets more frustrating than

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.670 
smashing planets more frustrating than
enjoyable<00:02:37.549> but<00:02:38.239> still<00:02:38.510> I'm<00:02:39.019> inclined<00:02:39.560> to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
enjoyable but still I'm inclined to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.410 
enjoyable but still I'm inclined to
think<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.250> lot<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.579> people<00:02:40.970> would<00:02:41.090> disagree

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
think a lot of people would disagree

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.840 
think a lot of people would disagree
with<00:02:41.600> me<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.140> because<00:02:42.590> again<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.340> isn't

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
with me on this because again this isn't

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.509 
with me on this because again this isn't
a<00:02:43.910> bad<00:02:44.060> game<00:02:44.299> at<00:02:44.450> all<00:02:44.540> plus<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.410> only<00:02:45.519> $0.99

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
a bad game at all plus it's only $0.99

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.180 
a bad game at all plus it's only $0.99
so<00:02:46.670> if<00:02:47.000> you're<00:02:47.150> into<00:02:47.420> defense<00:02:47.840> games<00:02:48.200> smashing

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
so if you're into defense games smashing

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.400 
so if you're into defense games smashing
planets<00:02:49.549> is<00:02:49.940> worth<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.930> look

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
planets is worth a look

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.360 
planets is worth a look
hopefully<00:02:52.190> you're<00:02:52.400> better<00:02:52.700> at<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:52.940> than<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.329> am
