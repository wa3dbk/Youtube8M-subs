 when I get inside that 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.709
 We did not have much culture. 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.020

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.460
 people learning the freezer in breaking

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.849
 common within groups 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:32.650

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:35.020

 youtube the thing changed has changed a lot 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 because we started having a 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.160
 information more than 3 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.640
 how I started dancing with 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.780

 ancient games this interaction means 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.210
 before mine in dance 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.510
 This made it much easier because I had not 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.520
 that went up to the seven guys and even the names 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.520
 dance to study 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.690
 in 2002 was the choreographer called 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.430
 see who is better known as the guru of 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.229
 souza who had a partnership with felipe 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.560
 Menezes calling is now finding 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.810
 design men in dance 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.899
 I won a scholarship there and started dancing. 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.149
 I did a hip-hop class there all through 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.159

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.159

 the river will look good from the first edition 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.640
 I think the first one was a bustle to 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.189
 everybody, everyone was very happy 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.350

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.969
 of accounts when much because

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.940
 professionals continue to come 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.860

 in the market as always launch a video 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.640
 so always winning battles 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.140
