00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.410
 20.00 and this biologist do a little 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.890
 fast so let's work we're going to 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.740
 create a new world 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.740
 as we can observe 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:33.810
 right so we have difficulty 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.290
 super cool we have the controls 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.290
 divided 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.950
 if we want to do where we are 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.950
 Let's see 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.080
 what else do we have all this roll we have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.160
 all this we have all this we have everything 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.160
 this and I do not even know how to say it 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
 Y 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.659
 now we go for example we can already 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.320
 change it in a simple way now it gets low 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.320
 all this well 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.840
 we have 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.210
 important things that come to be the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.280
 sand of souls that we call slow but 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.649
 what I think you have imported 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.649
 right now is the next thing is that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.450
 it's snow 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.260
 well let's the positions 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.520
 and one that we're going to grab too 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.780
 the pumpkin and we will also grab 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.380
 one of these well 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.380
 good 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.730
 let's import 1 2 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.570
 two 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.150
 if it is a little complicated 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.850
 the truth is complicated 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.270
 but we're going to love our character 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.930
 A) Yes 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.430
 or if 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.430
 and this time if we hit him 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.180
 but I'm going to remove the volume 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.060
 and we are going to put the heads up 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.060
 we check something very father all 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.850
 and let's go see more things we're going to 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.480
 see what else we can do the anvil already 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.480
 I mentioned it 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.580
 or has effects 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.240
 we will continue with this roll will 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.710
 see the following we love friends this 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.710
 which is for me 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020
 Perez 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.720
 do not be so horrible 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.720
 and this one 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.569
 you are already thinking about this one 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.590
 Beach 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.590
 I want to see it 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.569
 enchantments 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.310
 I want to see something very important something very 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.110
 important in this video then before 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.140
 be a little faster 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.420
 because I do not want it to be because I already did 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.380
 this video but it was not uploaded because 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.600
 because they do not know have problems 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.600
 let's try it with my editor so I 'm going 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.239
 we'll see 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.780
 we have our tasting table while 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.319
 that you take or said they have problems 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.319
 but then he took it off 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.090
 we approach the field 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.650
 we have this framework that I want to see if 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.980
 they throw the particles 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.379
 good father we have gratitude to the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.690
 kitty attracting a kitten we have to 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.290
 lend him like that I'm going towards him like this 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.290
 you are mine 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.150
 does not want the best is better is mine is 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.150
 my own 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.190
 it does not matter we have this was also a d 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.969
 and then nothing more kids than really 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.189
 he is very father 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.249
 Well what else can I tell you, it 's very 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.449
 true 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:01.309
 we are father this new version 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.309
 now if you could say that equal of the 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.370
 and for example let's say that this 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.090
 if it explodes we have a text we have a 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.510
 excellent animation and obviously it's with 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.380
 sound but I fluids so we're going to 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.810
 activate this and let's go into birds 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.220
 in the video we arrived ok about to 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.360
 finish it so it is not so long 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.340
 I think it's going to be without integer 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.349
 so guys I'm speechless I do not know 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.349
 nor what to say to them I'm like no 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.600
 with the man 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.679
 webber and then the portal has sound 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.679
 but as I say no 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.220
 as I say no 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:55.880
 the molding 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.860
 noble so I have a golden apple 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.810
 and more guys that are here have videos 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.000
 today I hope you liked the 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.480
 video if you liked ask the people I commented 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.830
 before telling them to use a keyboard or 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.830
 a control we need the following 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.830
 they need 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.800
 you need 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:24.720
 they pressed their phone 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.720
 on your phone 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.920
 some little buttons 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.870
 a few buttons the button have to 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.050
 press you 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.100
 and let's say the one of those who know of three 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.900
 hairline 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.480
 pressed on the three line for 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.330
 to leave 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.680
 so I can get out on the way we go 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.280
 I mean to come out well 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.280
 look
