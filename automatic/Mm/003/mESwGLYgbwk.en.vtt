00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.310
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:06.649
 welcome to beta tv pro in this video 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.339
 we will learn to use an abs read for 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.339
 record a video 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.470
 First of all, familiarize yourself with your 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.220
 camera what else you can because you're going to 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.689
 need a lot of it because you will use it 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.029
 a complete manual manual approach because 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.440
 the autofocus does not work for us 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.200
 well in these cameras in the event that 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.780
 do not have a tripod stabilizer what 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.809
 that it stabilizes the image have 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.489
 activated 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.710
 image stabilizer that brings the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.300
 lens or in the event that you bring it to the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.000
 same camera 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.909
 if you can always use a font 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.760
 external audio input get your 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.619
 microphone or you can also use a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.379
 audio recorder like I am 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.269
 doing me although it also works well 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.700
 a microphone connected to the camera as 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.830
 this one of lapel and good also to leave your 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.960
 camera in manual mode and use these things 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.850
 who are here starting with the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.770
 shutter speed is best 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 always leave the double the amount of 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.920
 frames per second to which you are 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.369
 working for example if you're recording 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.429
 at 24 frames per second the right thing 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.640
 would leave it to a 48 but as in a 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.039
 of slr maybe there can not be what 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.619
 you can leave in a 50 I do the same if 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.299
 recorded at 25 frames per second if 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.649
 you're recording at 60 frames per second 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:44.049
 you should increase to a 125 something and so the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.159
 opening should fragma in this case the 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.380
 minimum is 3.5 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.920
 and well there they can be increasing in this 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.439
 case is at 10 13 14 while the number 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.259
 is greater more closed is in our 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.750
 diaphragm so the image is going to be 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.329
 will be more focused or will they 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.560
 to be able to focus everything but if we lower the 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.770
 number a in this case 3.5 can reach 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.130
 1.4 1.8 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.530
 it's going to be wide open what it means 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.750
 that will come a lot of light and will create 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.330
 this depth field where the background 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.040
 it's super blurry and good they'll be able 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.860
 focus super little and it's going to be pretty 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.100
 difficult usually I always leave the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.010
 fixed shutter speed together with 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.370
 the opening and to change the exposure 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.120
 you change the iso which is the sensitivity 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.140
 from your camera always leave it as low 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.380
 possible I hope 100 200 400 that does not pass 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.700
 beyond the 1600 you can also go 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.200
 varying the white balance leave it in 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.900
 manual mode and you walk adjusting to 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.390
 white balance corresponding to the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.470
 take where you're recording because if 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.470
 you leave it in automatic mode 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.330
 you are going to see a change of color 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.740
 very small but in the long run it's going to 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.470
 notice 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.640
 another thing is to configure the picture style 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.450
 have your nikon or canon camera and 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.490
 leave it as flat as possible to 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.250
 obviously the fact of having an image 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.400
 flat means it has no contrast 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.190
 nor saturation so as I already 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.130
 we receive is flat 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.500
 then I was in postproduction or in 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.860
 edit you can set the color to your 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.780
 taste more effectively if your camera 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.730
 has this flip-up screen will take advantage 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.150
 to make high flat planes 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.190
 sideways how will you take advantage if you have 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.959
 this screen and those are the main ones 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.930
 recommendations that I can give you for 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:00.420
 that you learn to use your camera to 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.099
 record video in this case we have a 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.040
 speed of 50 because we are 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:09.150
 recording at 24 frames per second 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.890
 an opening of 3.5 and a made of 1250 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.100
 with 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.079
 pictures style in the flattest mode that 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.290
 you can and it's just a matter of squeezing 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.560
 record and get all the juice out of you 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.440
 camera also if you can install it 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.280
 a hack that allows you to use a major big 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.230
 break or record in heavier formats 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.040
 for 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.960
 edit better in post-production and that's 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.640
 all any doubt to work the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.350
 comments if you liked the video dale 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.840
 thumb up and if you want to see more 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.840
 subscribe will be until the next goodbye 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.260
 the frames per second the right thing 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.620
 it would be that bitch the fingerprint shell of your 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.780
 mother of the camera community shit leaves 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.550
 to take shit pictures starting with the 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.050
 shutter speed is best 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.800
 always leave her and the car with check 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.800
 mother passed by here
