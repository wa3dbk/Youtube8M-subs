a lot of the album actually kind of

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.289 
a lot of the album actually kind of
think<00:02:47.859> of<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.220> new<00:02:48.430> identity<00:02:48.579> for<00:02:49.030> the

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
memorable track but it has been a

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.170 
memorable track but it has been a
favorite<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.799> mine<00:03:51.010> while<00:03:51.310> listening<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
favorite of mine while listening to the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.839 
favorite of mine while listening to the
album<00:03:52.329> overall<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.560> do<00:03:53.620> see<00:03:54.069> improvement<00:03:54.729> from

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
album overall I do see improvement from

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.030 
album overall I do see improvement from
this<00:03:55.060> group<00:03:55.329> and<00:03:55.629> they<00:03:56.079> seem<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.409> be<00:03:56.500> moving<00:03:56.919> in

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
this group and they seem to be moving in

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.250 
this group and they seem to be moving in
more<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.370> an<00:03:57.459> accessible<00:03:58.030> direction<00:03:58.780> which<00:03:59.049> I

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
more of an accessible direction which I

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.140 
more of an accessible direction which I
definitely<00:03:59.859> see<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.159> a<00:04:00.190> good<00:04:00.459> thing<00:04:00.729> for<00:04:01.030> this

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
definitely see is a good thing for this

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.649 
definitely see is a good thing for this
band

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
band

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.420 
band
there<00:04:01.870> are<00:04:02.019> definitely<00:04:02.470> plenty<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.190> weak

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
there are definitely plenty of weak

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.399 
there are definitely plenty of weak
moments<00:04:03.940> on<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.269> record<00:04:04.720> but<00:04:04.989> there<00:04:05.169> are<00:04:05.379> a

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
moments on this record but there are a

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.050 
moments on this record but there are a
few<00:04:05.739> highlights<00:04:06.129> kind<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.609> scattered

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
few highlights kind of scattered

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.059 
few highlights kind of scattered
throughout<00:04:07.329> if<00:04:07.810> you're<00:04:08.079> a<00:04:08.109> longtime<00:04:08.680> fan<00:04:09.040> of

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
the band I would definitely recommend

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.569 
the band I would definitely recommend
listening<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.530> album<00:04:11.739> first<00:04:12.310> before

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
listening to the album first before

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.789

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
rushing out and buying it because the

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.129 
rushing out and buying it because the
sound<00:04:15.280> change<00:04:15.639> might<00:04:16.000> initially<00:04:16.570> shock<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.109> a

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
sound change might initially shock you a

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.349 
sound change might initially shock you a
little<00:04:17.470> bit<00:04:17.650> but<00:04:18.010> all-in-all<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.699> think<00:04:19.120> many
