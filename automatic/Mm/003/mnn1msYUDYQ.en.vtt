 hessen where the name is misleading 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.910
 Rheinhessen is not located in Hesse 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.010

 city ​​is 7 kings were in mainzer dom 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.980
 crowned here in the well-preserved 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.749
 old town of mainz you can still 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.339

 220 of the region thus vines planted 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:49.059
 it is a good 26,000 hectares the size of 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.059
 around 26,000 football fields 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.530
 around 4000 wine growers produce here 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.970
 two million hectoliters of wine per year 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.970
 especially typical of the region 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.080
 these little vineyard cottages the 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.730
 so-called trulli 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.530
 here, the winemakers have earlier 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.140
 Wanted bad weather protection and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.020
 Of course, one or the other glass 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.710
 The latter happens today as well 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.710
 still located 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.810
 one of the top locations in hesse 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.110
 right on the rhine 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.770
 the routan at the excellent riesling 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.980
 grown 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.360
 The red slope unites many 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.030
 location factors a vineyard 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.040
 needs to be world class 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.720
 The sun of the Rhine with his 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.520
 moisture and the red soil with 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 his minerality he 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.820
 the riesling speech in particular gives the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.030
 you will even taste the wine afterwards 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.070
 the winemakers in hessen are in front 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 all for your experimentation 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.980
 and their varieties are known wealth 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.770
 easy to find in germany hardly 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.310
 that on a short area like her 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.850
 were 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.070
 thurgau weissburgunder or hover or 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.410
 Riesling can be found 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.760
 So everything the vine varieties range 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.400
 You can actually give up here 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.280
 find very limited space and that is 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.380
 I just think has great rheinhessen 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.510
 the biggest silvaner at the professional 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.090
 world these wines surprise by their

 abundance and fine fruit to enjoy 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.130
 By the way, also lovingly converted 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 former stall a winemaker on the spot 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.160
 that too is typical Rheinhessen 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.130
