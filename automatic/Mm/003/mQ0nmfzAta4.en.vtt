00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.999 

the<00:00:01.410> damage<00:00:01.860> potential<00:00:02.429> on<00:00:02.610> throwing<00:00:03.510> access

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
the damage potential on throwing access

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.530 
the damage potential on throwing access
like<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.190> Francisca<00:00:05.759> wielded<00:00:06.330> by<00:00:06.359> the

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
like the Francisca wielded by the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.190 
like the Francisca wielded by the
Francisca<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.560> bomb<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:08.870> awesome<00:00:09.870> because

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
Francisca here bomb is awesome because

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.610 
Francisca here bomb is awesome because
it<00:00:10.469> has<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.800> hundred<00:00:11.280> or<00:00:11.400> more<00:00:11.460> piercing<00:00:12.090> damage

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
it has a hundred or more piercing damage

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.320 
it has a hundred or more piercing damage
and<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:14.070> can't<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> unit<00:00:15.120> cord

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
and you can't see this on a unit cord

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.930 
and you can't see this on a unit cord
but<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.690> has<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.080> twenty<00:00:16.590> five<00:00:16.859> bonus<00:00:17.490> against

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
but it has a twenty five bonus against

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.650 
but it has a twenty five bonus against
infantry<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.510> means<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.740> each<00:00:19.980> hit<00:00:20.310> is

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
infantry that means that each hit is

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
infantry that means that each hit is
guaranteed<00:00:21.660> unless<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.769> blocked<00:00:23.609> by<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
guaranteed unless it's blocked by a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.050 
guaranteed unless it's blocked by a
shield<00:00:24.090> each<00:00:24.630> hit<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:26.060> 125

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
shield each hit is going to do 125

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.930 
shield each hit is going to do 125
damage<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:30.420> I've<00:00:31.140> done<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.700> have

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
damage so what I've done here is I have

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.200 
damage so what I've done here is I have
noticed<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.870> seem<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> underperform

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
noticed that they seem to underperform

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.209 
noticed that they seem to underperform
compared<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:36.960> should<00:00:37.219> considering

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
compared to what they should considering

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.180 
compared to what they should considering
their<00:00:38.370> damage<00:00:38.670> potential<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.980> there<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
their damage potential so there is a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.080 
their damage potential so there is a
trajectory<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.270> an<00:00:42.719> accuracy<00:00:43.230> issue<00:00:44.090> with

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
trajectory and an accuracy issue with

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.459 
trajectory and an accuracy issue with
the<00:00:45.840> axis<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> Francisco<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> wanted<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the axis of the Francisco so I wanted to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.950 
the axis of the Francisco so I wanted to
see<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.129> could<00:00:50.190> alleviate<00:00:50.910> some<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.719> by

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
see if I could alleviate some of this by

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.130 
see if I could alleviate some of this by
putting<00:00:52.230> them<00:00:52.559> very<00:00:53.370> very<00:00:53.730> close<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.809> very

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
putting them very very close very very

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.860 
putting them very very close very very
close<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.860> an<00:00:55.949> enemy<00:00:56.039> unit<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.850> course<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
close to an enemy unit of course this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.380 
close to an enemy unit of course this
wouldn't<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.739> feasible<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.820> even

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
wouldn't really be feasible or even

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.830 
wouldn't really be feasible or even
possible<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.530> battle<00:01:04.830> situation<00:01:05.750> but

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.030 

just<00:01:09.840> look<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.260> happens<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> hosts

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
just look at what happens to the hosts

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.359 
just look at what happens to the hosts
girls<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:12.380> when<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> Francisca<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.100> able

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
girls here when the Francisca are able

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.609 
girls here when the Francisca are able
to<00:01:14.460> throw<00:01:14.640> their<00:01:14.880> javelin<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.509> their<00:01:15.720> axis<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to throw their javelin at their axis of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.100 
to throw their javelin at their axis of
prompt<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> axes<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.689> thrown

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.929 

94<00:01:22.110> kills<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:25.369> impressive<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.759> say<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
94 kills that is impressive to say the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.390 
94 kills that is impressive to say the
least<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:28.020> let's<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.710> many<00:01:28.920> kills<00:01:29.189> they

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
least now let's see how many kills they

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.010 
least now let's see how many kills they
get<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.329> run<00:01:30.840> into<00:01:31.170> range<00:01:32.570> they<00:01:33.570> run<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
get if they run into range they run in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.350 
get if they run into range they run in
they<00:01:34.439> throw<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.100> from<00:01:35.310> Kiska<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:35.880> Frankie's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
they throw there from Kiska or Frankie's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
they throw there from Kiska or Frankie's
car<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.750> Francisco<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.560> however<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
car or Francisco or however you want to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.440 
car or Francisco or however you want to
pronounce<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:40.220> let's<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.460> how<00:01:41.880> they<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.119> if

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
pronounce it let's see how they do if

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.819 
pronounce it let's see how they do if
they<00:01:42.720> throw<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.590> front<00:01:43.890> Franchesca<00:01:44.610> from

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
they throw the front Franchesca from

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:55.469 
they throw the front Franchesca from
extreme<00:01:46.829> range

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.850 

well<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:56.750> going<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:56.930> be<00:01:57.049> more<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.470> medium

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
well it's going to be more of a medium

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.469 
well it's going to be more of a medium
range<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.280> guess<00:01:58.490> yeah<00:01:59.060> medium<00:01:59.540> range<00:01:59.780> or<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:02.000> bit

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
range I guess yeah medium range or a bit

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.660 
range I guess yeah medium range or a bit
down<00:02:02.659> decisive<00:02:03.110> here<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:04.280> going<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.520> be

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
down decisive here it's going to be

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.360 
down decisive here it's going to be
extreme<00:02:05.240> range<00:02:09.729> I've<00:02:10.729> thrown<00:02:11.150> all<00:02:11.480> my

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
extreme range I've thrown all my

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.300 
extreme range I've thrown all my
Francesca<00:02:13.420> 61<00:02:14.420> kills<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:16.330> dead<00:02:17.330> close<00:02:18.310> 94

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
Francesca 61 kills so dead close 94

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.500 
Francesca 61 kills so dead close 94
kills<00:02:19.959> extreme<00:02:20.959> range<00:02:21.200> 61<00:02:21.980> kills<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.519> but

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
kills extreme range 61 kills and but

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.160 
kills extreme range 61 kills and but
this<00:02:23.720> was<00:02:24.049> when<00:02:24.590> stationary<00:02:25.299> so<00:02:26.299> let's<00:02:26.780> see

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
this was when stationary so let's see

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.949 
this was when stationary so let's see
what<00:02:27.560> happens<00:02:28.010> if<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.519> run<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.450> throw<00:02:29.750> them

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
what happens if I run in and throw them

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.920 
what happens if I run in and throw them
it<00:02:30.140> if<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.530> effects<00:02:31.340> anything<00:02:32.030> either<00:02:32.660> way

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it if that effects anything either way

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.110 
it if that effects anything either way
so<00:02:35.930> I'm<00:02:35.989> going<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> run<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.709> throw<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.610> run

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
so I'm going to run in throw and run

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.840 
so I'm going to run in throw and run
back<00:02:38.660> again<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.230> throw<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.549> would<00:02:40.700> be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
back again and throw so this would be

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.100 
back again and throw so this would be
like<00:02:41.030> throwing<00:02:41.269> precursors<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.319> charge

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
like throwing precursors on the charge

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:59.880 
like throwing precursors on the charge
first<00:02:45.110> hit<00:02:48.099> yep<00:02:49.130> 25<00:02:49.760> kills

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:08.190 

and<00:03:02.220> second<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.830> 51<00:03:06.640> kills<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.690> I'm<00:03:07.990> actually

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
and second so 51 kills so I'm actually

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.830 
and second so 51 kills so I'm actually
getting<00:03:08.530> less<00:03:09.130> kills<00:03:09.550> here<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.390> might<00:03:10.600> be<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
getting less kills here this might be a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:21.630 
getting less kills here this might be a
range<00:03:11.170> issue<00:03:11.940> but<00:03:13.890> 6151<00:03:16.470> 94<00:03:17.470> kills<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.980> no

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
range issue but 6151 94 kills so no

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.180 
range issue but 6151 94 kills so no
question<00:03:22.150> about<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.600> it's<00:03:23.170> much<00:03:23.830> more

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
question about it it's much more

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.180 
question about it it's much more

purely because of the range the axes are
thrown<00:03:42.730> from<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.520> believe<00:03:48.880> we're<00:03:49.060> going<00:03:49.209> to

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
thrown from so I believe we're going to

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.229 
thrown from so I believe we're going to
reorient<00:03:49.959> our<00:03:50.350> lines<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.739> bit<00:03:51.660> yep<00:03:53.880> move<00:03:54.880> up<00:03:55.060> to

reorient our lines a bit yep move up to

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.820 
reorient our lines a bit yep move up to

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.900 
house calls of course done a lot of
testing<00:04:04.239> with<00:04:04.299> hetero<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.610> gets<00:04:06.610> a<00:04:06.760> bit

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
testing with hetero so gets a bit

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:30.000 
testing with hetero so gets a bit
confusing<00:04:07.299> sometimes

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:40.960 

just<00:04:31.030> reorienting<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.210> lines<00:04:32.420> a<00:04:32.570> bit<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.880> I'm

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
just reorienting the lines a bit so I'm

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.230 
just reorienting the lines a bit so I'm
going<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.270> run<00:04:41.510> in<00:04:42.250> throw<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.670> Frankish<00:04:44.000> car

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
going to run in throw the Frankish car

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.920 
going to run in throw the Frankish car
and<00:04:45.400> wasn't<00:04:46.400> timed<00:04:46.820> perfectly<00:04:47.150> here<00:04:47.660> but<00:04:47.810> this

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
and wasn't timed perfectly here but this

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.440 
and wasn't timed perfectly here but this
just<00:04:48.200> illustrates<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:49.070> issue<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.910> throw<00:04:50.180> one

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
just illustrates the issue you throw one

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.870 
just illustrates the issue you throw one
volley<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.850> then<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:53.390> house<00:04:53.510> girls<00:04:53.870> just

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
volley and then the house girls just

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.370 
volley and then the house girls just
absolutely<00:04:55.880> destroy<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.690> Frankish<00:04:57.050> car

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
absolutely destroy the Frankish car

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.170 
absolutely destroy the Frankish car
they<00:04:57.770> basically<00:04:58.010> weren't<00:04:58.490> able<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.850> kill

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
they basically weren't able to kill

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.370 
they basically weren't able to kill
anything<00:04:59.870> on<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.920> church<00:05:01.160> against<00:05:02.380> against

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
anything on the church against against

anything on the church against against
he<00:05:03.470> was<00:05:03.590> caught<00:05:03.740> on<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.040> whose<00:05:04.190> car<00:05:04.400> are<00:05:04.550> they

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
he was caught on the whose car are they

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.130 
he was caught on the whose car are they
are<00:05:04.760> cheaper<00:05:05.210> than<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.480> Frankish<00:05:05.810> girl<00:05:05.990> so

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
are cheaper than the Frankish girl so

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.300 
are cheaper than the Frankish girl so
even<00:05:06.410> though<00:05:06.500> they're<00:05:06.710> able<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:07.010> throw<00:05:07.190> with

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
even though they're able to throw with

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.580 
even though they're able to throw with
their<00:05:07.400> precursors<00:05:07.670> it's<00:05:08.510> just<00:05:08.780> not<00:05:09.200> going<00:05:09.470> to

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
their precursors it's just not going to

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.710 
their precursors it's just not going to
happen<00:05:09.740> for<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.400> franc<00:05:10.700> for<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.420> Frankish

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
happen for the franc for the Frankish

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.950 
happen for the franc for the Frankish
guy<00:05:11.870> here<00:05:12.020> Bob<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:16.640> here<00:05:17.360> I'm<00:05:17.450> going<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.690> try<00:05:17.930> a

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
guy here Bob and here I'm going to try a

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.020 
guy here Bob and here I'm going to try a
denser<00:05:18.710> formation<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:22.160> see<00:05:22.310> if<00:05:22.490> that<00:05:22.610> affects

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
denser formation to see if that affects

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.750 
denser formation to see if that affects
how<00:05:23.300> many<00:05:23.620> kills<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.770> get<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.310> see<00:05:25.460> if<00:05:25.640> it

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
how many kills I get and to see if it

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.050 
how many kills I get and to see if it
affects<00:05:26.090> how<00:05:26.360> many<00:05:26.980> axis<00:05:27.980> are<00:05:28.130> thrown<00:05:28.610> on<00:05:28.850> the

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
affects how many axis are thrown on the

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:40.390 
affects how many axis are thrown on the
charge<00:05:35.920> so<00:05:36.920> let's<00:05:37.190> see<00:05:37.310> here<00:05:38.860> yeah<00:05:39.860> about<00:05:40.010> the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
charge so let's see here yeah about the

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.220 
charge so let's see here yeah about the
same<00:05:41.320> about<00:05:42.320> 50%<00:05:43.100> are<00:05:43.370> mo<00:05:43.640> remaining<00:05:44.150> so<00:05:44.510> they

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
same about 50% are mo remaining so they

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.110 
same about 50% are mo remaining so they
did<00:05:45.470> manage<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.800> throw<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.220> R<00:05:46.250> axis<00:05:46.610> they<00:05:46.820> did

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
did manage to throw the R axis they did

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.440 
did manage to throw the R axis they did
about<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.810> same<00:05:48.080> amount<00:05:48.260> of<00:05:48.560> damage<00:05:49.360> but<00:05:50.360> to

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
about the same amount of damage but to

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.540 
about the same amount of damage but to
sum<00:05:50.660> this<00:05:50.810> up<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.530> closer<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:52.220> can<00:05:52.340> throw

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
sum this up the closer you can throw

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.880 
sum this up the closer you can throw
your<00:05:52.790> Frankish<00:05:53.570> go<00:05:53.720> from<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.350> better<00:05:54.590> it's

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
your Frankish go from the better it's

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.410 
your Frankish go from the better it's
going<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.160> be<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.640> worst<00:05:55.820> it's<00:05:56.030> going<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.300> be

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
going to be the worst it's going to be

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.910 
going to be the worst it's going to be
for<00:05:56.630> your<00:05:56.720> enemy<00:05:57.020> because<00:05:57.260> these<00:05:57.380> axes<00:05:57.800> are

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
for your enemy because these axes are

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.540 
for your enemy because these axes are
very<00:05:58.250> inaccurate<00:05:59.500> if<00:06:00.500> a<00:06:00.890> unit<00:06:01.220> is<00:06:01.340> running

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
very inaccurate if a unit is running

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.060 
very inaccurate if a unit is running
towards<00:06:02.120> you<00:06:02.240> you<00:06:02.390> might<00:06:02.570> also<00:06:02.870> see<00:06:03.350> that<00:06:03.710> a

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
towards you you might also see that a

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.960 
towards you you might also see that a
lot<00:06:04.670> of<00:06:04.700> the<00:06:04.880> axis<00:06:05.240> just<00:06:05.390> go<00:06:05.630> flying<00:06:06.820> above<00:06:07.820> the

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
lot of the axis just go flying above the

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.720 
lot of the axis just go flying above the
unit<00:06:08.240> but<00:06:08.750> accuracy<00:06:09.290> is<00:06:09.470> very<00:06:09.500> very<00:06:10.190> poor<00:06:10.490> on

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
unit but accuracy is very very poor on

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.480 
unit but accuracy is very very poor on
the<00:06:10.760> Frankish<00:06:11.540> car<00:06:11.780> a<00:06:12.020> hair<00:06:12.200> bomb<00:06:12.380> so<00:06:13.040> if<00:06:13.280> you

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
the Frankish car a hair bomb so if you

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.460 
the Frankish car a hair bomb so if you

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
can get in really really close and fire

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.470 
can get in really really close and fire
into<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:15.980> unshielded<00:06:16.250> side<00:06:16.670> you're<00:06:17.150> going<00:06:17.360> to

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
into the unshielded side you're going to

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.690 
into the unshielded side you're going to
be<00:06:17.630> able<00:06:17.690> to<00:06:17.900> destroy<00:06:18.260> units<00:06:18.680> but<00:06:18.920> the<00:06:19.340> problem

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
be able to destroy units but the problem

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.200 
be able to destroy units but the problem
is<00:06:19.820> getting<00:06:19.850> there<00:06:20.420> and<00:06:20.600> not<00:06:20.780> getting<00:06:21.140> charged

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
is getting there and not getting charged

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.330 
is getting there and not getting charged
strengthen<00:06:23.210> over
