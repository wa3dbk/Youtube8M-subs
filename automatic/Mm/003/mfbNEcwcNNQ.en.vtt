00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.330 
and yeah the grip level of the track is
still<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:27.120> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.360> point<00:00:27.920> because<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.190> too

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.240 
still not on the point because not too
many<00:00:29.369> riders<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.289> it<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.500> channel<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.070> very

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.080 

I<00:00:37.030> mean<00:00:38.030> it's<00:00:38.300> a<00:00:38.450> very<00:00:38.530> let's<00:00:39.530> say<00:00:39.730> this<00:00:40.730> dark

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
I mean it's a very let's say this dark

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.820 
I mean it's a very let's say this dark
cave<00:00:41.300> everything<00:00:41.810> I<00:00:41.930> mean<00:00:42.080> it's<00:00:42.290> uphill

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
cave everything I mean it's uphill

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.280 
cave everything I mean it's uphill
downhill<00:00:43.330> specially<00:00:44.330> done<00:00:44.570> bond<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:44.990> a<00:00:45.020> very

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
downhill specially done bond is a very

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.470 
downhill specially done bond is a very
special<00:00:45.380> corner<00:00:45.980> very<00:00:46.340> heartbreaking<00:00:46.790> uphill

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
special corner very heartbreaking uphill

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.620 
special corner very heartbreaking uphill
and<00:00:47.690> then<00:00:48.310> don't<00:00:49.310> do<00:00:49.490> it<00:00:49.520> goes<00:00:49.880> downhill<00:00:50.210> them

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
and then don't do it goes downhill them

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.250 
and then don't do it goes downhill them
many<00:00:50.930> floating<00:00:51.260> corners<00:00:51.950> in<00:00:52.190> third<00:00:52.640> gear<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
many floating corners in third gear and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.950 
many floating corners in third gear and
very<00:00:54.260> hard<00:00:54.470> braking<00:00:54.890> points<00:00:55.630> here<00:00:56.630> so

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
very hard braking points here so

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.120 
very hard braking points here so
generally<00:00:57.620> it's<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.890> very<00:00:58.070> technical<00:00:58.280> talk

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.090 

I<00:01:02.300> mean<00:01:03.300> until<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.020> chattering<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.920> not

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
I mean until now the chattering was not

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.670 
I mean until now the chattering was not
the<00:01:05.309> big<00:01:05.910> issue<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.200> also<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the big issue there because also the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.610 
the big issue there because also the
clip<00:01:07.890> level<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> track<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.940> not<00:01:09.440> like<00:01:10.440> it

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
clip level on the track was not like it

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.670 
clip level on the track was not like it
will<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.280> race<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.870> expect<00:01:13.290> when

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
will be on the race so we expect when

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.220 
will be on the race so we expect when
all<00:01:14.100> three<00:01:14.820> categories<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.660> here<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.020> more

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
all three categories are here and more

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.190 
all three categories are here and more
bikes<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.800> drug<00:01:17.160> anyway<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.880> trip<00:01:18.780> level

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
bikes on the drug anyway the trip level

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.250 
bikes on the drug anyway the trip level
and<00:01:19.320> character<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:19.980> change

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.730 

no<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.490> mean<00:01:26.210> anyway<00:01:26.900> it's<00:01:27.050> difficult<00:01:27.500> before

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
no I I mean anyway it's difficult before

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.190 
no I I mean anyway it's difficult before
the<00:01:28.040> race<00:01:28.190> week<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.670> say<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:28.910> is<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.480> was<00:01:29.840> only<00:01:30.050> a

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
the race week to say it is it was only a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.440 
the race week to say it is it was only a
test<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.710> your<00:01:30.860> ma<00:01:31.010> hobbles<00:01:31.370> also<00:01:32.060> only<00:01:32.300> do

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
test and your ma hobbles also only do

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.300 
test and your ma hobbles also only do
this<00:01:32.660> here<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:35.000> think<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:36.260> will<00:01:36.530> be<00:01:36.770> for

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
this here so but I think it will be for

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.850 
this here so but I think it will be for
both<00:01:37.490> bikes<00:01:37.850> will<00:01:38.330> have<00:01:38.510> some<00:01:38.810> positive<00:01:39.080> parts

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
both bikes will have some positive parts

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.760 
both bikes will have some positive parts
on<00:01:40.010> this<00:01:40.160> talk<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.730> maybe<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:42.020> another<00:01:42.410> place

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
on this talk and maybe on another place

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.250 
on this talk and maybe on another place
but<00:01:42.800> general<00:01:43.790> at<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.210> end<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.840> lap<00:01:45.020> time

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
but general at the end of the lap time

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.460 
but general at the end of the lap time
we<00:01:45.470> will<00:01:45.620> be<00:01:45.830> again<00:01:46.100> very<00:01:46.340> close

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.700 

oh<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.880> mean<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.390> don't<00:01:52.720> know<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.990> Yama<00:01:53.200> bike<00:01:53.530> I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
oh I mean I don't know the Yama bike I

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.540 
oh I mean I don't know the Yama bike I
cannot<00:01:54.160> touch<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.300> so<00:01:55.600> just<00:01:55.990> from<00:01:56.830> outside<00:01:57.310> but

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
cannot touch it so just from outside but

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.450 
cannot touch it so just from outside but
I<00:01:57.580> think<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.330> will<00:01:58.630> be<00:01:58.840> sure<00:01:59.590> competition

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
I think it will be sure competition

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.430 
I think it will be sure competition
again<00:02:00.790> on<00:02:00.970> this<00:02:01.180> very<00:02:01.480> similar<00:02:02.020> level<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.410> mean

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
again on this very similar level I mean

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.190 
again on this very similar level I mean
like<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.550> see<00:02:03.730> last<00:02:03.970> year<00:02:04.240> yamaha<00:02:04.720> have<00:02:04.930> some

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
like we see last year yamaha have some

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.560 
like we see last year yamaha have some
advantage<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.460> point<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:07.120> themselves

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
advantage on that point on themselves

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.200 
advantage on that point on themselves
advantage<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:08.800> but<00:02:09.810> general<00:02:10.810> at<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.170> end

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
advantage here but general at the end

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:20.180 
advantage here but general at the end
they<00:02:13.210> will<00:02:13.390> fight<00:02:13.690> for<00:02:13.930> victory<00:02:13.990> both<00:02:14.620> sides

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.670

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.979 

I<00:02:59.069> mean<00:03:00.069> they<00:03:00.190> excavate<00:03:00.640> each<00:03:01.090> bike<00:03:01.480> have<00:03:01.810> it

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
I mean they excavate each bike have it

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.350 
I mean they excavate each bike have it
so<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:03.459> can<00:03:03.700> feel<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.330> clear<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:06.360> it's

lace and even this first place I mean

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.180 
lace and even this first place I mean
this<00:04:33.750> was<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.990> very<00:04:34.259> special<00:04:34.560> moment<00:04:34.830> for

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
this was a very special moment for

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.490 
this was a very special moment for

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
combination is here and then I think

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.920 
combination is here and then I think
from<00:04:41.129> that<00:04:41.190> moment<00:04:41.520> on<00:04:41.849> we<00:04:41.879> had<00:04:42.240> very<00:04:42.539> very

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
from that moment on we had very very

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.140 
from that moment on we had very very
nice<00:04:43.919> victories<00:04:44.580> we<00:04:45.389> had<00:04:45.479> also<00:04:45.810> bad<00:04:46.020> times<00:04:46.319> and

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
nice victories we had also bad times and

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.210 
nice victories we had also bad times and
very<00:04:48.150> important<00:04:48.750> thing<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.139> all<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.680> team<00:04:49.889> and

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
very important thing is all the team and

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.279 
very important thing is all the team and
rider<00:04:50.610> always<00:04:51.060> stick<00:04:51.270> together<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.900> we<00:04:52.080> went

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
rider always stick together and we went

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.110 
rider always stick together and we went
through<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.800> good<00:04:53.130> moments<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.729> bad<00:04:53.909> moments

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
through the good moments and bad moments

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.749 
through the good moments and bad moments
and<00:04:54.810> i<00:04:54.900> think<00:04:55.139> that's<00:04:55.409> that's<00:04:55.860> also<00:04:56.310> like<00:04:56.490> give
