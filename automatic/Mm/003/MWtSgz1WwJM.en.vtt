want that to be my spot and I is but
that's<00:02:31.840> really<00:02:32.020> out<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.650> my<00:02:32.890> control<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.340> out

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.890 
that's really out of my control and out
of<00:02:33.610> his<00:02:33.730> control<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:34.300> think<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.570> we<00:02:34.690> can't

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
of his control I think that we can't

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.180 
of his control I think that we can't
control<00:02:35.140> us<00:02:35.320> gonna<00:02:35.530> watch<00:02:35.680> there<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.010> working

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190

control us gonna watch there and working
hard<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.800> think<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.130> what<00:02:39.310> we're

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430
