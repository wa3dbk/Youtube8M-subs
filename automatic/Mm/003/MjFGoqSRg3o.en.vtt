00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
well I am a scientist so I got the part

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.379 
well I am a scientist so I got the part
because<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:07.650> was<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> only<00:00:08.639> scientist<00:00:09.090> slash

had I think I think three auditions in
total<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:21.929> on<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.380> own

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
total the first one was like on my own

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
total the first one was like on my own
and<00:00:22.800> then<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.099> brought<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.339> in<00:00:23.640> again<00:00:24.390> just

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
and then they brought me in again just

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.050 
and then they brought me in again just
to<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.320> sure<00:00:25.349> if<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.400> maybe

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
to see for sure if I was like maybe

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
see if we had any chemistry and I was

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.120 
see if we had any chemistry and I was
it's<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> hard<00:00:33.810> thing<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.140> because<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.680> have

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
it's a hard thing to do because you have

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.550 
it's a hard thing to do because you have
to<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.820> show<00:00:36.660> people<00:00:36.900> in<00:00:37.200> ten<00:00:37.410> minutes

to like show people in ten minutes

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.720 
to like show people in ten minutes

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
whether or not you have chemistry with

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.580 
whether or not you have chemistry with
another<00:00:39.090> person<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.080> I'm<00:00:40.200> trying<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
desperately like am it chemistry - Anna

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.060 
desperately like am it chemistry - Anna
in<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.490> audition<00:00:45.350> weirdly<00:00:46.350> because<00:00:46.860> that's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
in the audition weirdly because that's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.950 
in the audition weirdly because that's
not<00:00:47.340> natural<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.720> I<00:00:48.750> was

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
not natural at all but that's what I was

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.570 
not natural at all but that's what I was
they<00:00:49.320> were<00:00:49.380> like<00:00:49.560> we<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:49.860> need<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.460> know

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
they were like we really need you know

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.120 
they were like we really need you know
these<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.470> chemistry<00:00:52.470> which<00:00:52.950> I

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
these two to have chemistry which I

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.310 
these two to have chemistry which I
think<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.820> naturally<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.050> in

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
think in and I do naturally but like in

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.020 
think in and I do naturally but like in
10<00:00:55.590> minutes<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.950> have<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.340> convey<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
10 minutes you have to like convey that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.740 
10 minutes you have to like convey that
so<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:58.080> stressful<00:00:59.330> but<00:01:00.330> we<00:01:00.570> got

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
so it was very stressful but we got

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
so it was very stressful but we got
there<00:01:00.990> I<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.710> had<00:01:01.830> enough<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.250> Here

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
there I think we had enough because Here

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.360 
there I think we had enough because Here
I<00:01:02.460> am

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.410 

I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.420> Lauren<00:01:09.690> it's<00:01:09.840> great<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
I think for Lauren it's great because I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
I think for Lauren it's great because I
imagine<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> she's<00:01:12.810> done<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
imagine that she's done all of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
imagine that she's done all of the
things<00:01:14.370> she<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.210> human<00:01:15.510> world

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
things she can do in the human world

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
things she can do in the human world
like<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.170> her<00:01:16.320> science<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.800> imagine<00:01:17.160> she's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
like with her science I imagine she's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.250 
like with her science I imagine she's
kind<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:17.610> hit<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.880> ceiling<00:01:18.330> sort<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
kind of hit that ceiling sort of and

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.860 
kind of hit that ceiling sort of and
then<00:01:20.010> she<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.760> challenges<00:01:21.240> her<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
then she so it challenges her in the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.300 
then she so it challenges her in the
fairy<00:01:22.080> world<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:22.410> she<00:01:22.680> finds<00:01:22.980> it<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> place

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
fairy world I think she finds it a place

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
fairy world I think she finds it a place
where<00:01:23.460> she's<00:01:23.610> challenged<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.690> think<00:01:24.900> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
where she's challenged but I think it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
where she's challenged but I think it's
also<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.230> lonely<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.980> her<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.250> some<00:01:26.700> ways

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
also really lonely for her in some ways

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
also really lonely for her in some ways
because<00:01:27.560> there's<00:01:28.560> nobody<00:01:29.130> else<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.550> her<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
because there's nobody else like her and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.930 
because there's nobody else like her and
Kenzi<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.450> her<00:01:30.690> sort<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.230> at<00:01:32.040> odds<00:01:32.370> at<00:01:32.670> times

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
Kenzi and her sort of at odds at times

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.290 
Kenzi and her sort of at odds at times
it<00:01:33.480> seems<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.550> don't<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.150> she

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
it seems and so I don't know that she

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.670 
it seems and so I don't know that she
has<00:01:36.510> another<00:01:37.080> kind<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.930> person<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
has another kind of you know person to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.170 
has another kind of you know person to
kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.980> relate<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.430> she's<00:01:41.730> on<00:01:41.880> her<00:01:42.000> own<00:01:42.150> out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
kind of relate to she's on her own out

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.840 
kind of relate to she's on her own out
there

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.820 

when<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.480> show<00:01:48.630> began<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.260> think<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.680> had<00:01:49.800> a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
when the show began I think they had a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.500 
when the show began I think they had a
very<00:01:50.040> clear<00:01:50.340> idea<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.880> Lauren<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.300> what<00:01:51.390> they

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
very clear idea of Lauren and what they

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.240 
very clear idea of Lauren and what they
wanted<00:01:51.900> she<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.290> very<00:01:52.530> particular<00:01:52.740> type<00:01:53.220> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
wanted she was a very particular type of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.250 
wanted she was a very particular type of
person<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.030> three-dimensional<00:01:54.420> person<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
person a very three-dimensional person I

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.720 
person a very three-dimensional person I
think<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.530> did<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.770> great<00:01:56.160> job<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
think they did a really great job of

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.030 
think they did a really great job of
creating<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.210> character<00:01:57.480> but<00:01:58.410> then<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.710> as

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
creating a character but then I think as

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.700 
creating a character but then I think as
you<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.970> on<00:02:00.150> as<00:02:00.360> actors<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.350> get<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.620> know

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
you go on as actors so they get to know

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.740 
you go on as actors so they get to know
the<00:02:01.830> actor<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> little<00:02:02.460> better<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.910> they<00:02:03.540> write

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the actor a little better and they write

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
the actor a little better and they write
your<00:02:03.930> strengths<00:02:04.290> they<00:02:04.410> write<00:02:04.620> to<00:02:04.770> sort<00:02:04.980> of

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
your strengths they write to sort of

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.000 
your strengths they write to sort of
things<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.180> you're<00:02:06.510> more<00:02:07.110> capable<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.800> than

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
things that you're more capable of than

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.900 
things that you're more capable of than
and<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:08.310> don't<00:02:08.490> know<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.610> at<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and they don't know that at the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.160 
and they don't know that at the
beginning<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.450> cast<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.960> right

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
beginning when they cast you right

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.360 
beginning when they cast you right
because<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.770> through<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.010> audition

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
because you go through the audition

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.040 
because you go through the audition
process<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.060> sort<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.330> meet<00:02:12.570> you<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
process and they sort of meet you and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.290 
process and they sort of meet you and
they<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:14.070> limited<00:02:14.550> sense<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
they have like a very limited sense of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.970 
they have like a very limited sense of
you<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.110> go<00:02:16.320> we're<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.560> season

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you and then as you go we're on season

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.400 
you and then as you go we're on season
three<00:02:17.220> now<00:02:17.480> currently<00:02:18.480> filming<00:02:18.900> season<00:02:19.080> three

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
three now currently filming season three

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.020 
three now currently filming season three
and<00:02:19.560> they<00:02:19.620> start<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> better<00:02:20.430> idea<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and they start to get a better idea of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.400 
and they start to get a better idea of
what<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.810> what<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.990> can't<00:02:22.230> do

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
what you can do and what you can't do

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.660 
what you can do and what you can't do
and<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.710> know<00:02:23.010> what<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> harder<00:02:23.640> time

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
and you know what you have a harder time

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.010 
and you know what you have a harder time
with<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.300> they'll<00:02:24.390> stay<00:02:24.510> away<00:02:24.690> from<00:02:24.750> that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
with and they'll stay away from that

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.020 
with and they'll stay away from that
sort<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.260> stuff<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.280> yeah<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.670> think<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
sort of stuff and so yeah I think it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.490 
sort of stuff and so yeah I think it
just<00:02:27.210> evolved<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.140> start<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
just evolved so I think you start to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.920 
just evolved so I think you start to
kind<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.800> collaborate<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:30.000> bit

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.880 

I<00:02:35.069> think<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.939> part<00:02:37.629> of<00:02:37.780> Lauren<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.319> liked

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
I think that the part of Lauren I liked

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.220 
I think that the part of Lauren I liked
playing<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.189> most<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.549> that<00:02:39.780> she's<00:02:40.780> um<00:02:43.230> she's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
playing the most is that she's um she's

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.459 
playing the most is that she's um she's
kind<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:45.629> jumble<00:02:46.629> of<00:02:46.780> bits<00:02:47.319> of

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
kind of this jumble of bits of

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.059 
kind of this jumble of bits of
personality<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:48.189> know<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.400> was<00:02:48.519> like<00:02:48.640> she's<00:02:48.909> a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
personality you know I was like she's a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.890 
personality you know I was like she's a
really<00:02:51.069> nerdy<00:02:51.400> kind<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:52.030> geeky<00:02:52.480> science

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
really nerdy kind of geeky science

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.050 
really nerdy kind of geeky science
person<00:02:53.889> and<00:02:54.040> when<00:02:54.159> she's<00:02:54.370> working<00:02:54.579> in<00:02:54.879> that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
person and when she's working in that

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.240 
person and when she's working in that
world<00:02:55.299> that<00:02:55.450> she's<00:02:55.780> completely<00:02:56.650> committed<00:02:56.950> to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
world that she's completely committed to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.099 
world that she's completely committed to
that<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:57.639> on<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.790> other<00:02:57.879> hand<00:02:58.060> she's<00:02:58.420> also<00:02:58.629> I

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
that but on the other hand she's also I

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
bit of a huge swing between being kind

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.229 
bit of a huge swing between being kind
of<00:03:16.329> like<00:03:16.709> it's<00:03:17.709> about<00:03:18.010> facts<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.819> it's<00:03:19.000> about

of like it's about facts and it's about

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.149 
of like it's about facts and it's about

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
numbers and she's in science world but

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.220 
numbers and she's in science world but
then<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:21.760> then<00:03:21.879> this<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.060> other<00:03:22.510> side<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:23.049> her

then but then this is other side of her

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.440 
then but then this is other side of her
that<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.590> really<00:03:24.250> open<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.909> warm<00:03:25.209> and

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
like she's kind of got a lot of traits

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:37.809 
like she's kind of got a lot of traits
about<00:03:30.969> her<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.389> think<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:32.049> pretty<00:03:32.379> cool

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.530 

I<00:03:39.010> didn't<00:03:40.010> learn<00:03:40.159> a<00:03:40.219> lot<00:03:40.489> about<00:03:40.819> her<00:03:41.060> before<00:03:41.510> I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
I didn't learn a lot about her before I

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.839 
I didn't learn a lot about her before I
played<00:03:42.290> her<00:03:42.469> you<00:03:42.620> know<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:42.769> sort<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.519> had<00:03:43.700> to

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
played her you know I sort of had to

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.300 
played her you know I sort of had to
learn<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.599> every<00:03:44.870> script<00:03:45.230> which<00:03:46.040> was<00:03:46.249> a

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
learn with every script which was a

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.729 
learn with every script which was a
challenge<00:03:46.790> because<00:03:47.060> in<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.349> very<00:03:48.560> beginning

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
challenge because in the very beginning

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.890 
challenge because in the very beginning
in<00:03:49.040> season<00:03:49.189> one<00:03:49.639> that<00:03:50.180> she<00:03:50.480> was<00:03:50.599> a<00:03:50.629> bit<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
in season one that she was a bit of a

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.839 
in season one that she was a bit of a
mystery<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.379> we<00:03:51.499> didn't<00:03:51.739> know<00:03:51.889> even<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:52.670> she

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
mystery and we didn't know even if she

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.910 
mystery and we didn't know even if she
was<00:03:52.999> good<00:03:53.629> or<00:03:53.810> not<00:03:54.079> good<00:03:54.109> you<00:03:54.560> know<00:03:54.709> and

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
was good or not good you know and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.000 
was good or not good you know and
neither<00:03:55.400> did<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.599> had<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.109> play<00:03:57.290> certain

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
neither did I so I had to play certain

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.160 
neither did I so I had to play certain
scenes<00:03:58.310> on<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> line<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.299> such<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.510> way<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.780> if

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
scenes on a line in such a way that if

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.289 
scenes on a line in such a way that if
anything<00:04:00.739> then<00:04:00.920> got<00:04:01.099> revealed<00:04:01.489> later<00:04:01.790> on<00:04:02.000> that

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
anything then got revealed later on that

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.759 
anything then got revealed later on that
it<00:04:02.659> made<00:04:03.019> some<00:04:03.290> sense

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
it made some sense

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.179 
it made some sense
I<00:04:04.450> couldn't<00:04:05.450> make<00:04:05.659> certain<00:04:05.930> clean<00:04:06.500> choices

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
I couldn't make certain clean choices

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.890 
I couldn't make certain clean choices
because<00:04:07.669> I<00:04:07.700> didn't<00:04:08.060> know<00:04:08.120> either<00:04:08.269> whether<00:04:08.749> or

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
because I didn't know either whether or

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.459 
because I didn't know either whether or
not<00:04:09.019> she<00:04:09.319> was<00:04:09.939> really<00:04:10.939> into<00:04:11.329> Beau<00:04:11.510> or<00:04:11.870> not<00:04:12.109> into

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:12.469 
not she was really into Beau or not into

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.920 
not she was really into Beau or not into
Beau<00:04:12.650> if<00:04:12.889> she<00:04:13.069> was<00:04:13.189> good<00:04:13.400> or<00:04:13.579> evil<00:04:13.909> and<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.269> and

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
Beau if she was good or evil and so and

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.170 
Beau if she was good or evil and so and
it<00:04:15.049> was<00:04:15.139> kind<00:04:15.349> of<00:04:15.409> fun<00:04:15.829> to<00:04:16.099> do<00:04:16.699> that<00:04:16.729> as<00:04:17.030> an

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
it was kind of fun to do that as an

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.670 
it was kind of fun to do that as an
actor<00:04:17.449> it<00:04:17.570> was<00:04:17.660> kind<00:04:17.840> of<00:04:17.900> fun<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.259> not<00:04:18.470> know

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
actor it was kind of fun to not know

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.330 
actor it was kind of fun to not know
because<00:04:18.949> I<00:04:19.630> had<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.930> find<00:04:21.739> ways<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.130> play

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
because I had to find ways to play

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.800 
because I had to find ways to play
certain<00:04:22.580> scenes<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.419> didn't<00:04:23.690> give

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
certain scenes so that I didn't give

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.300 
certain scenes so that I didn't give
away<00:04:23.960> too<00:04:24.110> much<00:04:24.440> or<00:04:24.710> that<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.860> didn't<00:04:25.160> make<00:04:25.250> a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
away too much or that I didn't make a

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.089 
away too much or that I didn't make a
really<00:04:25.849> clear<00:04:26.389> choice<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.990> sort<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.560> tell<00:04:27.919> the

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
really clear choice to sort of tell the

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.820 
really clear choice to sort of tell the
audience<00:04:28.220> too<00:04:28.699> much<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.930> ya<00:04:30.139> know<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.410> didn't

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:42.510 
learn I kind of learned about her at the
same<00:04:33.169> time<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.919> viewers<00:04:34.190> did

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.780 

you

tough<00:04:51.130> one<00:04:51.250> for<00:04:51.460> her<00:04:51.580> because<00:04:51.760> she<00:04:52.090> was<00:04:52.120> sort

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
tough one for her because she was sort

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.280 
tough one for her because she was sort
of<00:04:52.450> treated<00:04:53.580> in<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.820> really<00:04:55.450> subservient<00:04:56.080> way<00:04:56.260> I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
of treated in a really subservient way I

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.260 
of treated in a really subservient way I
mean<00:04:56.620> at<00:04:56.770> one<00:04:56.890> point<00:04:56.920> she<00:04:57.340> was<00:04:57.370> locked<00:04:57.700> up<00:04:57.910> and

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
mean at one point she was locked up and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.730 
mean at one point she was locked up and
and<00:04:58.540> and<00:05:00.240> sort<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.330> in<00:05:01.450> prison<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.500> think

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
and and sort of in prison and I think

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.700 
and and sort of in prison and I think
that<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:04.450> way<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.660> related<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.380> was<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:05.680> I

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
that the way I related to it was that I

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.970 
that the way I related to it was that I
think<00:05:05.920> everybody<00:05:06.160> has<00:05:06.520> felt<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:08.410> at<00:05:08.710> some

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
think everybody has felt that at some

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.580 
think everybody has felt that at some
point<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.610> know<00:05:09.670> I<00:05:09.820> have<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.930> know<00:05:11.050> where<00:05:11.410> you

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
point I know I have you know where you

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.220 
point I know I have you know where you
are<00:05:11.950> less<00:05:12.220> than<00:05:12.580> or<00:05:12.640> you<00:05:13.030> feel<00:05:13.270> less<00:05:13.570> than<00:05:13.600> and

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
are less than or you feel less than and

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.020 
are less than or you feel less than and
I<00:05:14.470> think<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.980> that's<00:05:15.220> what<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:15.550> was<00:05:15.700> for<00:05:15.760> her

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
I think that that's what it was for her

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.760 
I think that that's what it was for her
she<00:05:16.330> was<00:05:16.510> sort<00:05:16.750> of<00:05:16.840> treated<00:05:17.230> like<00:05:17.440> she<00:05:17.620> was

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
she was sort of treated like she was

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.150 
she was sort of treated like she was
less<00:05:17.980> than<00:05:18.250> for<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.480> whole<00:05:19.780> year<00:05:20.110> she<00:05:20.770> was<00:05:20.890> less

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
less than for a whole year she was less

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.110 
less than for a whole year she was less
than<00:05:21.400> face<00:05:21.790> she<00:05:22.120> because<00:05:22.570> she<00:05:22.600> was<00:05:22.870> human<00:05:24.120> she

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
than face she because she was human she

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.150 
than face she because she was human she
was<00:05:25.270> almost<00:05:25.420> disposable<00:05:26.170> to<00:05:26.320> some<00:05:26.500> degree<00:05:26.860> and

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
was almost disposable to some degree and

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.880 
was almost disposable to some degree and
I<00:05:27.430> think<00:05:27.670> the<00:05:27.790> thing<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.210> kept<00:05:28.510> Lauren<00:05:29.410> being

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
I think the thing that kept Lauren being

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.640 
I think the thing that kept Lauren being
necessary<00:05:30.550> was<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:31.030> she<00:05:31.390> is<00:05:31.660> brilliant<00:05:32.260> and

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
necessary was that she is brilliant and

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.920 
necessary was that she is brilliant and
she<00:05:32.800> does<00:05:33.070> actually<00:05:33.340> have<00:05:33.760> they<00:05:34.090> do<00:05:34.150> need<00:05:34.720> her

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
she does actually have they do need her

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.850 
she does actually have they do need her
the<00:05:35.170> fade<00:05:35.380> do<00:05:35.710> need<00:05:36.040> her<00:05:36.960> she<00:05:37.960> she<00:05:38.470> knows<00:05:38.650> the

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
the fade do need her she she knows the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.550 
the fade do need her she she knows the
most<00:05:39.040> in<00:05:39.669> their<00:05:40.030> world<00:05:40.419> as<00:05:40.930> a<00:05:40.990> doctor<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.440> as<00:05:41.530> a

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
most in their world as a doctor and as a

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.770 
most in their world as a doctor and as a
scientist<00:05:41.980> so<00:05:42.250> that<00:05:42.970> was<00:05:43.090> kind<00:05:43.300> of<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.450> saving

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
scientist so that was kind of the saving

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.240 
scientist so that was kind of the saving
grace<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.020> little<00:05:44.410> bit<00:05:44.560> for<00:05:44.740> her<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:45.070> she

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
grace a little bit for her that she

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.240 
grace a little bit for her that she
wasn't<00:05:45.430> just<00:05:45.730> any<00:05:45.940> other<00:05:46.330> human<00:05:46.870> but<00:05:47.830> outside

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
wasn't just any other human but outside

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.830 
wasn't just any other human but outside
of<00:05:48.310> that<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.940> know<00:05:49.150> humans<00:05:49.660> aren't

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
of that you know humans aren't

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.990 
of that you know humans aren't
necessarily<00:05:50.370> revered<00:05:51.370> in<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.640> faith

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
necessarily revered in the faith

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.990 
necessarily revered in the faith
community<00:05:52.150> so<00:05:53.100> yeah<00:05:54.100> so<00:05:54.400> that<00:05:54.520> was<00:05:54.580> a<00:05:54.640> struggle

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
community so yeah so that was a struggle

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.009 
community so yeah so that was a struggle
for<00:05:55.030> her

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:01.019 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.569 

yeah<00:06:02.019> that's<00:06:02.319> a<00:06:02.439> hard<00:06:02.589> question<00:06:02.829> what<00:06:03.279> is<00:06:03.429> her

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:03.579 
yeah that's a hard question what is her

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:05.129 
yeah that's a hard question what is her
greatest<00:06:03.879> strength<00:06:04.059> cuz<00:06:04.539> I<00:06:04.629> think<00:06:04.869> she<00:06:04.989> has<00:06:05.109> a

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
greatest strength cuz I think she has a

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.479 
greatest strength cuz I think she has a
lot<00:06:05.439> but<00:06:05.859> I<00:06:05.889> think<00:06:06.249> that<00:06:06.459> she<00:06:06.759> is<00:06:06.969> um

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:08.489 
lot but I think that she is um

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:12.119 
lot but I think that she is um
relentlessly<00:06:09.749> instead<00:06:10.749> of<00:06:10.869> she<00:06:11.199> I<00:06:11.529> think<00:06:12.009> when

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
relentlessly instead of she I think when

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.119 
relentlessly instead of she I think when
she<00:06:12.309> has<00:06:12.489> anything<00:06:13.119> in<00:06:13.299> her<00:06:13.569> mind<00:06:14.379> that<00:06:14.739> she

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
she has anything in her mind that she

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.669 
she has anything in her mind that she
she<00:06:16.059> won't<00:06:16.269> stop<00:06:16.719> I<00:06:17.019> think<00:06:17.259> she's<00:06:17.409> relentless

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:17.679 
she won't stop I think she's relentless

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:19.739 
she won't stop I think she's relentless
she's<00:06:18.009> tenacious<00:06:18.219> she's<00:06:19.059> she's<00:06:19.449> like

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:19.749 
she's tenacious she's she's like

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:21.989 
she's tenacious she's she's like
committed<00:06:20.319> and<00:06:20.619> and<00:06:20.919> I<00:06:21.609> think<00:06:21.849> she's

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:21.999 
committed and and I think she's

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:26.429 
committed and and I think she's
immensely<00:06:22.599> loyal<00:06:22.899> to<00:06:24.389> wherever<00:06:25.389> her<00:06:25.839> focus<00:06:26.229> is

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
immensely loyal to wherever her focus is

you know be it bow or the Fae as a group
or<00:06:30.039> her<00:06:30.639> project<00:06:31.539> of<00:06:31.749> the<00:06:31.959> day<00:06:31.989> or<00:06:32.619> you<00:06:33.009> know<00:06:33.099> I

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:35.159 
or her project of the day or you know I
think<00:06:33.279> she<00:06:33.639> really<00:06:34.059> commits<00:06:34.509> a<00:06:34.719> million

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
think she really commits a million

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.739 
think she really commits a million
percent<00:06:35.349> you<00:06:36.099> never<00:06:36.399> get<00:06:36.699> less<00:06:37.479> than<00:06:37.689> a

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:37.749 
percent you never get less than a

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:44.680 
percent you never get less than a
million<00:06:37.959> percent<00:06:38.169> of<00:06:38.529> Lauren<00:06:38.860> I<00:06:38.979> don't<00:06:39.219> think

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.870 

I<00:06:45.760> think<00:06:46.760> that<00:06:47.320> well<00:06:48.320> gosh<00:06:48.800> I<00:06:49.130> think<00:06:49.490> that<00:06:49.670> bow

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
I think that well gosh I think that bow

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.290 
I think that well gosh I think that bow
would<00:06:50.120> be<00:06:50.330> a<00:06:51.010> big<00:06:52.010> cat<00:06:52.280> I<00:06:52.550> think<00:06:52.670> she'd<00:06:53.030> be<00:06:53.090> like

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
would be a big cat I think she'd be like

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.230 
would be a big cat I think she'd be like
a<00:06:53.360> panther<00:06:53.690> I<00:06:54.610> don't<00:06:55.610> think<00:06:55.760> she<00:06:55.850> could<00:06:56.030> be<00:06:56.210> a

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
a panther I don't think she could be a

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.550 
a panther I don't think she could be a
little<00:06:56.530> cat<00:06:57.530> that's<00:06:58.400> not<00:06:58.730> it<00:06:59.090> wouldn't<00:06:59.270> work

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
little cat that's not it wouldn't work

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.380 
little cat that's not it wouldn't work
so<00:07:00.560> I<00:07:00.830> think<00:07:00.980> bow<00:07:01.310> would<00:07:01.430> be<00:07:01.580> a<00:07:01.610> panther<00:07:02.150> and

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390 
so I think bow would be a panther and

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.200 
so I think bow would be a panther and
then<00:07:03.020> I<00:07:03.110> think<00:07:03.380> if<00:07:03.530> Lauren<00:07:04.130> I<00:07:04.370> think<00:07:04.790> she'd

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
then I think if Lauren I think she'd

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.830 
then I think if Lauren I think she'd
have<00:07:05.330> to<00:07:05.480> be<00:07:06.160> like<00:07:07.160> a<00:07:07.190> Siamese<00:07:07.850> cat<00:07:08.330> if<00:07:08.570> they

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
have to be like a Siamese cat if they

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.860 
have to be like a Siamese cat if they
could<00:07:09.050> be<00:07:09.200> big<00:07:10.000> like<00:07:11.000> if<00:07:11.150> you<00:07:11.570> could<00:07:11.720> have<00:07:11.780> a

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
could be big like if you could have a

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.730 
could be big like if you could have a
big<00:07:12.230> Panther<00:07:13.190> sized<00:07:13.520> Siamese<00:07:14.300> cat<00:07:14.740> then

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
big Panther sized Siamese cat then

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.530 
big Panther sized Siamese cat then
Lauren<00:07:16.100> would<00:07:16.250> be<00:07:16.280> that<00:07:16.580> and<00:07:16.850> bode<00:07:17.240> be<00:07:17.510> a

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
Lauren would be that and bode be a

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.840 
Lauren would be that and bode be a
panther
