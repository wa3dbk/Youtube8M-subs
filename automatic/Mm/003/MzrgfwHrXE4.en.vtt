waterless<00:01:47.250> card<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.450> opinion<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:50.780> that's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
waterless card in my opinion so that's

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.429 
waterless card in my opinion so that's
just<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.930> want

just the way it is so if you really want

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.510 
just the way it is so if you really want
an<00:01:55.560> open<00:01:55.680> computer<00:01:57.200> you're<00:01:58.200> almost<00:01:58.740> paying

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
an open computer you're almost paying

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.950 
an open computer you're almost paying
the<00:01:59.790> same<00:02:00.210> price<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:01.049> an<00:02:01.560> apple<00:02:02.100> imac<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.780> get

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the same price as an apple imac to get

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.280 
the same price as an apple imac to get
it<00:02:04.110> equal<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> imax<00:02:05.579> standards<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> it's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it equal to the imax standards and it's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.800 
it equal to the imax standards and it's
not<00:02:07.530> even<00:02:07.560> equal<00:02:08.429> i<00:02:08.640> mean<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.360> only<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.629> little

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
not even equal i mean it's only a little

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.410 
not even equal i mean it's only a little
behind<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.190> only<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.520> hundred<00:02:11.849> dollars

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
behind but it's only a hundred dollars

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.440 
behind but it's only a hundred dollars
less

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
less

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.870

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.590 
so if you want I guess if you want SI
star<00:02:24.270> computer<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.860> get<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:27.150> you're

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
star computer you can get it but you're

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.790 
star computer you can get it but you're
still<00:02:28.020> paying<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.310> same<00:02:29.640> price<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:31.380> for
