00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
 bongo 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:10.649
 that's action 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:15.349
 hello to all this is franck and superstood saleh you ok well that 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.129
 it's cool 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.349
 so today we have plenty of company videos afloat on pc a game 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.800
 edited by thq developed by relic entertainement of these strategy 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 it's for 18 and over 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.459
 so it's already out since September 2006 yesterday and if so 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.360
 this criticism 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.080
 I took meals join world and yes 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.020
 and that you then I say it right away because if the csc 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.230
 it's very important we can notice a structure yes because it's really 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.499
 excellent then there we are in the countryside and we must protect 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:50.410
 not this eye this little town 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.299
 and so we have to stop elephants fishing the Germans 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:54.359
 yes of advanced 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.359
 okay so there's three for you see or so reacted but i'm going 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.139
 trying to put as many mines on the ports as 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.410
 protections there I put sandbags 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.630
 heavy weapons here they are asm I wait for them I wait for them 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.170
 what happened 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 and there he comes and there I think he'll behave do it 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.820
 in a few years we can think 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.990
 the camera is of course and here it is super nice check ceic for 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.410
 mark the details of the units 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.380
 true but really it's super detailed 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.880
 he wanted to realize 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.930
 kombouarÃ© the fort also repelling the bullets that whistle the explosions the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.610
 eyes it's really it's really super super well done 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 then one day world leader is waiting for the campaign we have only one campaign 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.830
 with the allies 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.010
 - and the capelle takes place just after the Normandy landings in fact 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.000
 we have a head of the first soccer land we want to be there finally we 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.200
 will show them because the spectacular has ben yes yes on the percent plan and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.490
 of the staging makes more cutscenes especially 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.200
 in mind including video just to show this campaign is 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.710
 improves dollars very good idea then there 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.620
 here we have only one ability to be the only one 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.719
 Happy birthday party 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.070
 a single campaign 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.120
 so we can really campaign with the Germans for example it's 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.370
 maybe a little pity that's true but for this campaign 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.790
 so good that she focused in a little 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.120
 we do not forgive him so it's possible this guy is weak for the cut of the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.160
 you're not kidding you do you shoot at the bazooka in the jaouda centers I have it 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.539
 wait 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.959
 pushed hard for the gifts that he and I think he wants and in life time 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.409
 who you are pretty nice one lasted ten to five legs as also to 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.339
 the skirmish 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.859
 not fly less than eight players jobin 8 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.839
 that we also see that I think we can still do another video on 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.219
 this mode and we will not I do not see a sponge to the region to show 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.649
 a little bit the mission that I like because I 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.649
 did ammann 15 minutes I prepared myself 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.209
 that is, I took care of him to prepare but the defenses 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.439
 and so the contest is over 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.819
 and the Germans attack and there must be a camp ten minutes 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.469
 ok I know this point there so it's pretty interesting missions from the point 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.239
 and so we also have missions on board we have to attack and obviously the 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.010
 enemy bases we have missions would promise like this one addictions 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.039
 quite varied framix country 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.290
 leighton at an active break 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.910
 I saw on the forms that had me a lot that led to the forum 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.950
 in europe the giro on a skin which can scramble an active break and which 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.520
 is very well done so it does not look m6 and graphics 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.159
 is excellent 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.839
 but also to move his units 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:14.589
 yes it works at home a small post allows to accumulate a little 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.699
 to give orders directly in the stroller he was sitting father 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:18.809
 convenient 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.409
 gold and its strategy and everything went well it's great this excellent 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.739
 really excellent it's good laughs it's true that at the level of details 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.739
 in a few hours in the lead to build a team that supports 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.579
 it's really nothing in a small millar cart for the massacre 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.679
 for all that he did well to get to the not attacked 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.829
 on the other hand at the level of the genes presenting the report 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.789
 I hope he captures 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.399
 I was stabbed 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.009
 I still feel that it takes a good bike yes it takes a good 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.499
 bike 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:54.179
 with this his fifth wife this case I see there I asked for a 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.130
 support to take back a little bit in danger 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.939
 receive weapons 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.219
 but here is stuck 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.059
 feeling cissed helstad lamah thomert smooth the matrix effect but now that 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:07.449
 there I can stop there as you are superb 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.939
 meaning 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.089
 it's great show 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.559
 Skf data stoppers provide themselves a configuration of a configuration 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.839
 minimum one point so there one turns in fact be a little bit more to know what 

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.509
 mansour kama chinen tournament one of the four for the budget pays 2 gigas of 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.889
 ram and there I forced over 800 that's it's still unclear with this 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.009
 hidden conflict obviously a pretty powerful break 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.740
 many obviously little dropped the details those who do not have a jam 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.029
 like what they say the minimum minimum is pk of jdr 500 gigas of 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.770
 ram 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.310
 and a little graphic card the geforce 8600 car a c5 that's really 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.960
 him 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.930
 minimum to enjoy it must be the minimum it is really the minimum that 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.630
 I think we can not take full advantage of a strike 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.340
 lower rates 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.670
 we're happy to break everything these are doing it 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.050
 in short, an incessant fight with no smoke without fire 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.419
 we are all stages 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.419
 - listening while I was thinking of playing a radio 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.379
 bazooka 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.819
 I know that to think of the rights of all as amelie are resistant 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.379
 this is the rule of the adventure game 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.180
 in the voice but I do not regret a second bompard the current crisis made of 

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:21.110
 destroy this terrible tanks that I'm doing a little eiffel tower 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.570
 the companies also offer thrown to schumi developed by relic 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.839
 entertainement this is the strategy that's happening came out on September 29, 2006 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.029
 it's for cf-18 and more to throw itself on pc 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.109
 eyi it's really good this dirt of 18 out of 20 a year by our soul and 

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:39.749
 super-standard that I think it's a bit special because the back of the hand 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.349
 the community pressures to charge her years video 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:46.719
 henrique 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.689
 we really see some innocent friendly stuff that's really impressive 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:53.369
 a date of love at all levels we will release a small band of 

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:54.439
 four 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.130
 the concept of dezir meanwhile 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.130
 thank you very much for watching this video that taught at all prices 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.999
 I still have hope
