00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
second generation wrestling fan he would

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.890 
second generation wrestling fan he would
have<00:05:18.430> been<00:05:18.580> watching<00:05:19.030> what<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.180> was<00:05:19.420> watching

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
have been watching what I was watching

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.270 
have been watching what I was watching
and<00:05:20.050> wanting<00:05:20.380> you<00:05:20.530> know<00:05:20.560> somebody<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.100> rip

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
and wanting you know somebody to rip

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.250 
and wanting you know somebody to rip
Hulk<00:05:21.610> Hogan's<00:05:22.060> head<00:05:22.330> off<00:05:22.510> at<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.840> same<00:05:23.050> time

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
Hulk Hogan's head off at the same time

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.530 
Hulk Hogan's head off at the same time
so<00:05:23.530> I<00:05:23.560> think<00:05:23.680> that<00:05:23.950> he's<00:05:24.700> filling<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.300> void<00:05:25.480> in

so I think that he's filling a void in

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.050 
so I think that he's filling a void in
wrestling<00:05:26.170> that<00:05:26.320> everybody<00:05:26.710> has<00:05:26.950> this<00:05:27.760> match
