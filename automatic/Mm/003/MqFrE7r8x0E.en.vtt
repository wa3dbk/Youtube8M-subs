 this recipe are the classics that do not 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.489
 they have artificial flavors and they are worth 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.399
 both in those that have the form of 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.260
 triangle like the round ones once

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.649

 you will find it in the section of 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.229
 Mexican cuisine from supermarkets 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.660
 It usually comes in a can when 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.800
 let's have a circle of sauce we cover it 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.800
 with the mixture of four cheeses 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.330
 We preheat the oven only for the part 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.690
 top and the grill if the oven has 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.000
 of him and we introduce the dish we heat 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 just enough for the cheese to melt 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.940
 that gets to brown you have to be very 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.060
 be careful not to burn the nachos 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 when the cheese is melted we take it out 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.500
 now we spread the pico de gallo which is 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.960
 a mixture of small pieces of 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.580
 pepper onion and tomatoes and on the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.030
 gelatinous part that contains 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.030
 nuggets 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.550
 next we place slices of 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.340
 jalapeño to taste it stings a lot so the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.409
 quantity and size of the pieces 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.020
 depend on the taste of each one if not 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.970
 you find jalapeños can be substituted 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 for chunks of vinegar in vinegar 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.590
 finally in the center of the plate 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.380
 we put a few tablespoons of guacamole and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.680
 sour cream that are two ideal sauces 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.600
 to spread these nachos we add a little 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.150
 of fresh coriander above 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.840
 decorate and aromatize and we already have them 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.090
 finished and ready to eat 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.000
 It is a fantastic recipe to serve 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.760
 as an entrée they are delicious and I do not know 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.980
 it takes almost nothing to prepare them they are very 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.480
 similar to the nachos san fernando that 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.910
 they serve in the foster restaurants 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.739
 hollywood but with the advantage that we 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.290
 they will come out cheaper and we will know what 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.780
 we are eating we hope you like them 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.349
 we are in the following recipe to 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.349
