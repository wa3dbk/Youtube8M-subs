 hello everyone today marina lomako 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:13.790
 and we will prepare the dogwood for as long as 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.960
 for this you need half a liter of brandy 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:24.140
 tablespoon of honey and 300 grams 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.949
 dogwood berries dogwood desirable to take 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 different here like me from 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.669
 garden dogwood 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.649
 And this wood and aroma will a bit 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.780
 different taste but if you don't have 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:45.860
 opportunities to take different dogwood take 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.809
 so what you have here are the differences seen 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.260
 let's start cooking in liter 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.550
 a clean jar 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.879
 but not sterilized I did not sterilize 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.879

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.150
 pouring berries 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.729
 I picked the berries beforehand so that I wouldn't 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.670
 it was them to burst 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.000
 I would come out later 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.360
 still filter but will not 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.360
 turbidity now open brandy 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.990
 and pour the berries and 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.490
 it remains to roll under the iron cover is not 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.490
 stir and not shake 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 now leave everything on rack for 3 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.490
