a<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:54.120> important<00:00:54.510> element<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.140> game

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a one important element here this game

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.369 
a one important element here this game
is<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.710> very<00:00:55.739> new<00:00:56.280> sort<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> genre<00:00:57.090> um<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
is in a very new sort of genre um in the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.660 
is in a very new sort of genre um in the
app<00:00:58.500> store<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:59.039> we've<00:00:59.190> sort<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> been

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
app store that we've sort of been

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
app store that we've sort of been
calling<00:01:00.949> beat<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> clock<00:01:02.280> pipeline<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.320> guess

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
calling beat the clock pipeline I guess

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.770 
calling beat the clock pipeline I guess
is<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> good<00:01:04.710> word<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.689> essentially<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is a good word for it essentially the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
is a good word for it essentially the
idea<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.350> starting<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.890> one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
idea is that you're starting at one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.920 
idea is that you're starting at one
point<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> level<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> need<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.780> lay

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
point of the level then you need to lay

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
point of the level then you need to lay
pipe<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.409> specific<00:01:10.890> combinations<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
pipe in specific combinations and so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.120 
pipe in specific combinations and so
it's<00:01:12.090> sort<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> puzzle<00:01:12.600> game<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
it's sort of a puzzle game to get to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.380 
it's sort of a puzzle game to get to
another<00:01:14.340> way<00:01:14.640> point<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.119> at<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.270> other

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
another way point that's at the other

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.760 
another way point that's at the other
into<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.780> level<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.320> essentially<00:01:16.650> your

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
into the level so essentially your

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670 
into the level so essentially your
plumbing<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.909> way<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.439> side

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
plumbing all the way to from one side

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
plumbing all the way to from one side
level<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> other<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> game

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
level to the other and as the game

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
level to the other and as the game
progresses<00:01:21.750> you'll<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.320> waypoints<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
progresses you'll have more waypoints to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.100 
progresses you'll have more waypoints to
to<00:01:23.520> mess<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.909> different<00:01:24.270> liquids<00:01:24.600> etc<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
to mess with different liquids etc you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.950 
to mess with different liquids etc you
just<00:01:25.320> start<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.710> water<00:01:25.920> though<00:01:26.960> didn't

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
just start out with water though didn't

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.940 
just start out with water though didn't
if<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.229> move<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.500> haven't<00:01:28.740> tried<00:01:28.920> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
if we can move that I haven't tried that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.090 
if we can move that I haven't tried that
yet<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.320> mind<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.829> guess<00:01:31.979> we're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
yet so with that in mind I guess we're

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.560 
yet so with that in mind I guess we're
gonna<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.310> ahead<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.490> jump<00:01:32.790> straight<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.329> if

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
gonna go ahead and jump straight in if

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
gonna go ahead and jump straight in if
you<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.350> more<00:01:34.530> about<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> game<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you want to know more about the game you

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.210 
you want to know more about the game you
can<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.150> combination<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.990> did

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
can do the combination that it just did

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
can do the combination that it just did
if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.369> would<00:01:38.460> ever<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.840> go

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
if you would ever like to do that you go

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.330 
if you would ever like to do that you go
ahead<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.200> hit<00:01:40.320> play<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.220> ready

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
ahead and hit play and then you're ready

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
ahead and hit play and then you're ready
to<00:01:41.430> roll<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> game<00:01:42.360> comes<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> couple

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to roll so the game comes with a couple

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590 
to roll so the game comes with a couple
different<00:01:43.649> game<00:01:44.610> modes<00:01:44.640> you've<00:01:45.149> got<00:01:45.299> quick

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
different game modes you've got quick

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.109 
different game modes you've got quick
which<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.020> simple<00:01:46.619> slap<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> which<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.000> what

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
which is simple slap it in which is what

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480 
which is simple slap it in which is what
I'll<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.270> doing<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.810> second<00:01:49.369> campaign<00:01:50.369> in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
I'll be doing just a second campaign in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.330 
I'll be doing just a second campaign in
survival<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.659> arcadis<00:01:52.229> campaign<00:01:53.009> comes

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
survival more arcadis campaign comes

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.209 
survival more arcadis campaign comes
with<00:01:53.520> something<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.299> 90<00:01:55.070> levels<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
with something I think like 90 levels to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.889 
with something I think like 90 levels to
play<00:01:56.399> through<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> heck<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.450> content

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
play through a heck of a lot of content

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.139 
play through a heck of a lot of content
and<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.590> custom<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> give<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> quick

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and then custom just to give you a quick

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
and then custom just to give you a quick
glance<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> campaign<00:02:01.259> which<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.430> beat

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
glance at the campaign which I have beat

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.330 
glance at the campaign which I have beat
hardly<00:02:03.180> any<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.810> also<00:02:04.049> comes<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.380> an<00:02:05.009> easy

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
hardly any of it also comes with an easy

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.940 
hardly any of it also comes with an easy
mode<00:02:05.700> which<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.630> maybe<00:02:07.140> we'll<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
mode which is maybe we'll do that that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.490 
mode which is maybe we'll do that that
way<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.610> um<00:02:09.170> more<00:02:10.170> convenient

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
way it's a little bit um more convenient

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.190 
way it's a little bit um more convenient
basically<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> pick<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> level<00:02:12.569> you

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
basically you go in you pick a level you

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.270 
basically you go in you pick a level you
get<00:02:13.349> bonus<00:02:13.590> points<00:02:13.830> for

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
get bonus points for

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.250 
get bonus points for
doing<00:02:14.459> specific<00:02:14.910> patterns<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> friend

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
doing specific patterns so I friend

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.630 
doing specific patterns so I friend
they've<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.740> names<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.160> forgot<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> name

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
they've all got names I forgot the name

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.620 
they've all got names I forgot the name
of<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:18.090> I'm<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> call<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
of this one I'm going to call it the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.000 
of this one I'm going to call it the
last<00:02:18.900> suit<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.350> don't<00:02:19.530> know<00:02:19.590> what<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.800> actually

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
last suit I don't know what it actually

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.370 
last suit I don't know what it actually
is<00:02:20.190> he<00:02:20.970> hit<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.300> button<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.870> loads<00:02:22.530> up

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
is he hit this button it loads up

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.500 
is he hit this button it loads up
eventually<00:02:25.380> there<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:25.980> go<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:27.060> basic<00:02:27.300> idea<00:02:27.330> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
eventually there we go the basic idea is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.150 
eventually there we go the basic idea is
that<00:02:27.569> you're<00:02:27.780> racing<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> clock<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.950> that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
that you're racing the clock and that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.300 
that you're racing the clock and that
you<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.790> place<00:02:30.630> piping<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.350> such<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> way

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
you want to place piping in such a way

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.760 
you want to place piping in such a way
that<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:33.300> eventually<00:02:33.480> reaches<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> other<00:02:34.470> end

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
that it eventually reaches the other end

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.710 
that it eventually reaches the other end
I<00:02:35.040> should<00:02:35.610> mention<00:02:35.850> right<00:02:36.150> off<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> bat<00:02:36.690> that

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
I should mention right off the bat that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.280 
I should mention right off the bat that
I<00:02:36.959> am<00:02:37.250> terrible<00:02:38.250> at<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.550> game<00:02:38.810> I'd<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:40.050> sure

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
I am terrible at this game I'd not sure

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.530 
I am terrible at this game I'd not sure
why<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.430> some<00:02:41.850> reason<00:02:42.209> I'm<00:02:42.300> just<00:02:42.450> not

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
why but for some reason I'm just not

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.420 
why but for some reason I'm just not
very<00:02:42.690> good<00:02:42.780> at<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.800> know<00:02:43.890> stuff

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
very good at it I don't know stuff

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.000 
very good at it I don't know stuff
happens<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.510> I'm<00:02:45.569> going<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.930> keep<00:02:46.560> laying<00:02:46.769> pipe

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
happens so I'm going to keep laying pipe

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.800 
happens so I'm going to keep laying pipe
down<00:02:47.190> until<00:02:47.489> eventually<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.910> get<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.630> where

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
down until eventually we get it to where

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.220 
down until eventually we get it to where
it<00:02:48.900> needs<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.170> go<00:02:50.000> etc<00:02:51.000> etc<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:51.930> sort<00:02:52.170> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
it needs to go etc etc that's sort of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.490 
it needs to go etc etc that's sort of
the<00:02:52.290> main<00:02:52.410> idea<00:02:53.750> hopefully<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.959> can<00:02:55.110> actually

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
the main idea hopefully I can actually

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.979 
the main idea hopefully I can actually
get<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:57.000> go<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.390> obviously<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.870> are<00:02:57.959> a

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
get this to go and obviously you are a

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.520 
get this to go and obviously you are a
given<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.860> set<00:02:59.069> number<00:02:59.100> of<00:03:00.170> piping<00:03:01.170> up<00:03:01.290> at<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
given a set number of piping up at the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.710 
given a set number of piping up at the
top<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.430> keep<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:02.730> mind<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.239> you

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
top that you have to keep in mind as you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.190 
top that you have to keep in mind as you
go<00:03:03.870> along<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.620> course<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.069> idea<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.459> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
go along the of course the idea is to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.229 
go along the of course the idea is to
use<00:03:07.200> what's<00:03:08.040> given<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.760> such<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> way

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
use what's given to you in such a way

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.240 
use what's given to you in such a way
that<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.989> does<00:03:10.200> match<00:03:10.470> up<00:03:10.769> with<00:03:10.890> where<00:03:11.130> you're

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
that it does match up with where you're

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.309 
that it does match up with where you're
going<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.420> quite<00:03:12.750> difficult<00:03:12.989> in

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
going this can be quite difficult in

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.340 
going this can be quite difficult in
times<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.709> fact<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.700> game<00:03:14.910> itself<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.569> pretty

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
times in fact the game itself is pretty

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.390 
times in fact the game itself is pretty
bloody<00:03:16.709> hard<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:19.380> again<00:03:19.620> I'd<00:03:19.799> already<00:03:20.070> mitad

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
bloody hard then again I'd already mitad

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.479 
bloody hard then again I'd already mitad
I'm<00:03:20.519> not<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.850> greatest<00:03:21.120> edit<00:03:22.100> but<00:03:23.100> that

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
I'm not the greatest edit but that

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.920 
I'm not the greatest edit but that
doesn't<00:03:23.790> detract<00:03:24.000> from<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.299> fact<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.810> is

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
doesn't detract from the fact that it is

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.690 
doesn't detract from the fact that it is
hard<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.320> if<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.530> misplace<00:03:25.860> something<00:03:26.310> it's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
hard and if you misplace something it's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.360 
hard and if you misplace something it's
misplaced<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.420> done<00:03:27.630> with<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.950> that's<00:03:29.130> sort

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
misplaced and done with so that's sort

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.100 
misplaced and done with so that's sort
of<00:03:29.489> just<00:03:30.030> something<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.420> sort<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.780> keep<00:03:30.959> in

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
of just something to sort of keep in

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.690 
of just something to sort of keep in
mind<00:03:31.320> as<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.620> as<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.769> go<00:03:32.100> about<00:03:32.220> playing<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
mind as you as you go about playing the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.020 
mind as you as you go about playing the
game<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:34.100> I<00:03:35.100> have<00:03:35.220> probably<00:03:35.640> screwed<00:03:35.910> this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
game like I have probably screwed this

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.210 
game like I have probably screwed this
one<00:03:36.180> up<00:03:36.239> at<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.600> point<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.829> you<00:03:37.920> can<00:03:38.010> see

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
one up at this point but as you can see

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.920 
one up at this point but as you can see
the<00:03:38.340> water<00:03:38.519> itself<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.150> already<00:03:39.420> starting<00:03:39.630> to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the water itself is already starting to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.259 
the water itself is already starting to
seep<00:03:40.200> out<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.680> real<00:03:41.010> physics<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:42.120> is

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
seep out with real physics that is

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.520 
seep out with real physics that is
something<00:03:42.570> that's<00:03:42.660> included<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> game

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
something that's included in the game

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.420 
something that's included in the game
you<00:03:43.650> do<00:03:43.799> get<00:03:43.950> actual<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:45.950> guess<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.100> word<00:03:47.250> is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
you do get actual I guess the word is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.449 
you do get actual I guess the word is
actual<00:03:47.880> pressure<00:03:48.120> physics<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.310> is

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
actual pressure physics so that is

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.050 
actual pressure physics so that is
included<00:03:52.609> okay<00:03:53.609> I'm<00:03:53.670> gonna<00:03:53.790> go<00:03:53.880> ahead<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
included okay I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.340 
included okay I'm gonna go ahead and
link<00:03:54.239> up<00:03:54.359> these<00:03:54.540> things<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.049> should<00:03:55.200> be

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
link up these things and this should be

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.250 
link up these things and this should be
good<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.590> go<00:03:55.709> here<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:56.160> just<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.430> second<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:58.140> of

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
good to go here in just a second and of

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.420 
good to go here in just a second and of
course<00:03:58.350> as<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.739> get<00:03:58.859> different<00:03:58.980> liquids

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
course as you get different liquids

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.470 
course as you get different liquids
involved<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.900> will<00:04:01.200> have<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:03.060> manage

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
involved you will have to to to manage

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.140 
involved you will have to to to manage
these<00:04:03.690> things<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:05.549> keeping<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:05.940> in

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
these things so just keeping that in

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.210 
these things so just keeping that in
mind<00:04:06.180> I'm<00:04:07.049> really<00:04:07.440> not<00:04:07.590> doing<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:07.950> quite

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
mind I'm really not doing this quite

for being sort of a topic at times it's
hard<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.859> do<00:04:13.980> these<00:04:14.130> kind<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.489> games<00:04:14.640> puzzle

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
hard to do these kind of games puzzle

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.240 
hard to do these kind of games puzzle
games<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.780> then<00:04:15.959> talk<00:04:16.169> at<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> same<00:04:16.470> time<00:04:16.829> so

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
games in then talk at the same time so

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.479 
games in then talk at the same time so
just<00:04:17.850> throw<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.209> out<00:04:18.239> there<00:04:18.650> let<00:04:19.650> me<00:04:19.769> try<00:04:20.430> to

just throw that out there let me try to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.770 
just throw that out there let me try to
get<00:04:20.640> rid<00:04:20.729> of<00:04:20.789> some<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.060> stuff<00:04:21.299> yeah<00:04:21.720> you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.860 
get rid of some of this stuff yeah you
know<00:04:22.019> what<00:04:22.200> let's<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.740> stick<00:04:23.039> with<00:04:23.099> it<00:04:23.870> you

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
know what let's just stick with it you

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.000 
know what let's just stick with it you
can<00:04:24.930> speed<00:04:25.229> up<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.440> game<00:04:25.470> by<00:04:25.710> hitting<00:04:25.830> this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
can speed up the game by hitting this

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.730 
can speed up the game by hitting this
point<00:04:26.250> down<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.640> bottom<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.330> buy<00:04:27.539> the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
point down the bottom to buy the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.219 
point down the bottom to buy the
way<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.099> then<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.240> get<00:04:29.330> points<00:04:29.539> for<00:04:29.690> that<00:04:29.930> and

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
way and then you get points for that and

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.170 
way and then you get points for that and
then<00:04:30.349> you're<00:04:30.470> done<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.550> there<00:04:31.729> you<00:04:31.759> go<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.150> is

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
then you're done so there you go that is

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.550 
then you're done so there you go that is
essentially<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.810> game<00:04:33.080> that's<00:04:33.259> how<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.530> rolls

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
essentially the game that's how it rolls

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.870 
essentially the game that's how it rolls
and<00:04:33.889> that's<00:04:34.009> how<00:04:34.099> it<00:04:34.220> operates<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.789> then

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
and that's how it operates and then

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.059 
and that's how it operates and then
you're<00:04:35.000> given<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.330> high<00:04:35.479> score<00:04:35.870> or<00:04:36.680> excuse<00:04:36.830> me<00:04:36.949> a

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
you're given a high score or excuse me a

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.779 
you're given a high score or excuse me a
score<00:04:37.539> as<00:04:38.539> well<00:04:38.960> as<00:04:39.289> you<00:04:40.280> know<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.400> few<00:04:40.639> basic

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
score as well as you know a few basic

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.850 
score as well as you know a few basic
points<00:04:41.720> about<00:04:41.870> how<00:04:42.020> well<00:04:42.169> you<00:04:42.289> did<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.770> you

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
points about how well you did and you

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.890 
points about how well you did and you
earn<00:04:42.949> money<00:04:43.190> which<00:04:43.669> you<00:04:43.789> can<00:04:43.940> spend<00:04:44.210> on<00:04:44.419> items

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
earn money which you can spend on items

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.930 
earn money which you can spend on items
which<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:45.919> pretty<00:04:46.099> cool<00:04:46.370> someone<00:04:46.699> who<00:04:46.759> hadn't

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
which is pretty cool someone who hadn't

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.540 
which is pretty cool someone who hadn't
hit<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.120> next<00:04:47.360> button<00:04:48.039> of<00:04:49.039> course<00:04:49.250> this<00:04:49.400> is

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
hit the next button of course this is

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.309 
hit the next button of course this is
just<00:04:49.580> act<00:04:50.060> one<00:04:50.389> which<00:04:50.660> you've<00:04:50.780> got<00:04:50.960> all<00:04:51.289> of

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
just act one which you've got all of

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.809 
just act one which you've got all of
this<00:04:51.590> content<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:52.099> play<00:04:52.250> through<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.699> then

this content to play through and then

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.339 
this content to play through and then
you<00:04:52.910> expand<00:04:53.360> into<00:04:53.569> other<00:04:53.599> is<00:04:54.020> there<00:04:54.199> a<00:04:54.229> couple

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
you expand into other is there a couple

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.100 
you expand into other is there a couple
different<00:04:55.539> scenarios<00:04:56.539> different<00:04:56.840> areas<00:04:57.020> to

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
different scenarios different areas to
