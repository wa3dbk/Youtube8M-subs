the<00:00:18.420> obsidian<00:00:19.110> sanctum<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> raid

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the obsidian sanctum which is a raid

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.200 
the obsidian sanctum which is a raid
from<00:00:21.720> Wrath<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> Lich<00:00:22.440> King<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:23.210> these

from Wrath of the Lich King and these
mounts<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.750> pretty<00:00:25.170> awesome

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
mounts are pretty awesome

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.220 
mounts are pretty awesome
mostly<00:00:26.970> because<00:00:27.119> they're<00:00:27.510> guaranteed<00:00:27.930> drops

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
mostly because they're guaranteed drops

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.400 
mostly because they're guaranteed drops
but<00:00:29.189> also<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:30.000> they're<00:00:30.449> frickin<00:00:30.869> Drake's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
but also because they're frickin Drake's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.180 
but also because they're frickin Drake's
and<00:00:32.059> they<00:00:33.059> look<00:00:33.330> sweet<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.650> first<00:00:34.830> one

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and they look sweet so the first one

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.290 
and they look sweet so the first one
that<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> saw<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> black<00:00:36.120> Drake

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that you saw there was the black Drake

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.200 
that you saw there was the black Drake
and<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> Twilight<00:00:37.469> Drake<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and this is the Twilight Drake the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.860 
and this is the Twilight Drake the
difference<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.200> getting<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.950> pretty

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
difference in getting them is pretty

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.700 
difference in getting them is pretty
easy<00:00:43.040> but<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> color<00:00:45.719> difference<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.260> quite

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
easy but the color difference is quite

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
easy but the color difference is quite
significant<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.489> well<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.719> Twilight<00:00:49.050> Drake

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
significant as well the Twilight Drake

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.950 
significant as well the Twilight Drake
is<00:00:49.260> more<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> blue<00:00:49.739> purple<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.420> black

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is more of a blue purple and the black

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.470 
is more of a blue purple and the black
is<00:00:52.170> supposed<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.430> black<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> sometimes

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
is supposed to be black but it sometimes

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
is supposed to be black but it sometimes
looks<00:00:54.629> purple<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> yeah<00:00:56.160> these<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:57.000> two

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
looks purple so yeah these these are two

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
looks purple so yeah these these are two

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
version both are pretty similar the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
version both are pretty similar the
25-man<00:01:34.170> has<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> few<00:01:34.979> different<00:01:35.310> mechanics

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
25-man has a few different mechanics

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.399 
25-man has a few different mechanics
during<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.509> boss<00:01:36.630> fight<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.290> most

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
during the boss fight but for the most

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.520 
during the boss fight but for the most
part<00:01:37.500> they're<00:01:38.189> both<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.640> easy<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.780> do

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
part they're both really easy you can do

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
part they're both really easy you can do
it<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.950> most<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> 10<00:01:41.820> men<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.119> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it in most in the 10 men you can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.289 
it in most in the 10 men you can
probably<00:01:42.479> solo<00:01:43.020> even<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.820> trio<00:01:45.030> in

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
probably solo even and you can trio in

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.749 
probably solo even and you can trio in
the<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> 25<00:01:46.049> man<00:01:46.399> unless<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.640> like

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the in the 25 man unless you're like

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.120 
the in the 25 man unless you're like
amazing<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> healer<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
amazing or if you have like a healer you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.429 
amazing or if you have like a healer you
could<00:01:50.369> probably<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.909> oh<00:01:51.229> but<00:01:53.750> you'll<00:01:54.750> find<00:01:55.200> out

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
could probably do oh but you'll find out

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
could probably do oh but you'll find out
that<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:56.399> pretty<00:01:56.579> much<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:56.880> died<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that we pretty much all died in the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.780 
that we pretty much all died in the
25-man<00:01:58.110> version<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.619> still<00:01:58.770> killed<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.130> so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
25-man version but we still killed it so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.670 
25-man version but we still killed it so
it's<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.350> those<00:02:01.469> things

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's just kind of one of those things

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.450 
it's just kind of one of those things
where<00:02:02.119> it's<00:02:03.119> an<00:02:03.270> easy<00:02:03.420> fight<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.340> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
where it's an easy fight but you can do

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.280 
where it's an easy fight but you can do
it<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.759> two<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.329> three<00:02:06.479> people<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it with two or three people if you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.639 
it with two or three people if you
really<00:02:07.860> want<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:09.019> but<00:02:10.019> if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.290> have<00:02:10.410> four

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
really want to but if you have four

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.130 
really want to but if you have four
that's<00:02:11.400> great<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:12.780> kind<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.020> hard<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that's great it's kind of hard to do so

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.840 
that's great it's kind of hard to do so
you<00:02:14.710> know<00:02:14.770> justify<00:02:15.190> having<00:02:15.460> more<00:02:15.610> people

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
you know justify having more people

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.800 
you know justify having more people
unless<00:02:16.090> they<00:02:16.270> already<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.540> them<00:02:16.690> out

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
unless they already have them out

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.960 
unless they already have them out
because<00:02:17.470> then<00:02:17.860> everyone<00:02:18.130> wants<00:02:18.520> them<00:02:18.640> out<00:02:18.760> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
because then everyone wants them out and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.570 
because then everyone wants them out and
they'll<00:02:19.060> fight<00:02:19.360> over<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.720> sometimes<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:20.580> it's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
they'll fight over it sometimes but it's

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520 
they'll fight over it sometimes but it's
it's<00:02:21.880> one<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.210> those<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.170> those<00:02:23.290> raids

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
it's one of those one of those raids

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.960 
it's one of those one of those raids
that<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.740> can<00:02:23.860> obviously<00:02:24.190> since<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.820> raid

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
that you can obviously since it's a raid

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.270 
that you can obviously since it's a raid
you<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.180> only<00:02:25.270> do<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.480> once<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.690> week<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.440> one<00:02:27.130> we

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
you can only do it once a week so one we

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.590 
you can only do it once a week so one we
can<00:02:27.490> get<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> black<00:02:27.850> Drake<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.270> next<00:02:28.450> week

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
can get the black Drake the next week

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.300 
can get the black Drake the next week
you<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.810> get<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.050> Twilight<00:02:29.380> Drake<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.800> then

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
you can get the Twilight Drake and then

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.010 
you can get the Twilight Drake and then
so<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:31.360> forth<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.840> do<00:02:31.930> that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
so on and so forth you have to do that

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.420 
so on and so forth you have to do that
for<00:02:32.200> every<00:02:32.290> person<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.650> wants<00:02:33.010> both<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
for every person that wants both of the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.540 
for every person that wants both of the
mounts<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.740> essentially<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.430> these

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
mounts so essentially to get these

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.580 
mounts so essentially to get these
mountains<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> guaranteed<00:02:37.810> drop<00:02:38.080> you'll

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
mountains as a guaranteed drop you'll

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.870 
mountains as a guaranteed drop you'll
see<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.890> there's<00:02:39.070> Drake's<00:02:39.370> within<00:02:39.700> this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
see that there's Drake's within this

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.810 
see that there's Drake's within this
obsidian<00:02:40.510> sanctum<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.520> keep<00:02:42.640> them

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
obsidian sanctum you have to keep them

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.690 
obsidian sanctum you have to keep them
alive<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.140> when<00:02:44.770> you're<00:02:44.950> running<00:02:45.070> past<00:02:45.459> them

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
alive so when you're running past them

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.340 
alive so when you're running past them
just<00:02:46.000> hug<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.390> wall<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.840> then<00:02:47.020> they<00:02:47.110> want<00:02:47.290> to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
just hug the wall and then they want to

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.600 
just hug the wall and then they want to
attack<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:48.010> then<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.310> don't<00:02:48.459> have<00:02:48.520> to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
attack you and then you don't have to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.660 
attack you and then you don't have to
worry<00:02:48.760> about<00:02:49.080> killing<00:02:50.080> them<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:51.340> kind<00:02:51.610> of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
worry about killing them it's kind of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.210 
worry about killing them it's kind of
it's<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:53.170> that's<00:02:53.350> how<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.680> get<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> drop

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
it's like that's how you get the drop

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.600 
it's like that's how you get the drop
you<00:02:54.580> have<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:55.000> keep<00:02:55.150> them<00:02:55.360> all<00:02:55.480> alive<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.610> and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
you have to keep them all alive and and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.160 
you have to keep them all alive and and
then<00:02:57.940> kill<00:02:58.180> all<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.420> trash<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.660> there<00:02:59.020> before

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
then kill all the trash in there before

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.190 
then kill all the trash in there before
you<00:02:59.320> kill<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:01.390> main<00:03:01.600> boss<00:03:01.780> which<00:03:02.050> is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
you kill the the main boss which is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.930 
you kill the the main boss which is
south<00:03:02.590> Aryan<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.310> think<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:03.820> how<00:03:03.910> you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
south Aryan I think that's how you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.479 
south Aryan I think that's how you
pronounce<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.560> which<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.860> big<00:03:06.070> dragon

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
pronounce it which is that big dragon

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.060 
pronounce it which is that big dragon
looking<00:03:06.730> thing<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.000> middle<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.980> know

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
looking thing in the middle so you know

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.710 
looking thing in the middle so you know
it's<00:03:09.250> go<00:03:09.400> around<00:03:09.640> kill<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.060> trash<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.570> then

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
it's go around kill the trash and then

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.350 
it's go around kill the trash and then
when<00:03:11.350> you're<00:03:11.470> done<00:03:11.560> killing<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> trash<00:03:12.360> you

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
when you're done killing the trash you

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.020 
when you're done killing the trash you
meet<00:03:13.570> up<00:03:13.720> for<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.380> boss<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:17.430> one<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.610> one

of<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> things<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.510> would<00:03:19.630> recommend

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
of the things that I would recommend

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.410 
of the things that I would recommend
doing<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.830> if<00:03:21.100> you're<00:03:21.310> all<00:03:21.459> level<00:03:21.850> 90<00:03:22.209> or

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
even just 85 or 80 and splitting up and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
even just 85 or 80 and splitting up and
kind<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:29.890> meeting<00:03:30.130> in<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.340> back<00:03:30.489> in<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
kind of meeting in the back in the

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.000 
kind of meeting in the back in the
middle<00:03:31.260> because<00:03:32.260> some<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.920> be

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
middle because some of you can be

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.830 
middle because some of you can be
working<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:34.060> mobs<00:03:34.239> on<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.480> other<00:03:34.600> side

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
working on the mobs on the other side

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.690 
working on the mobs on the other side
while<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.350> others<00:03:35.530> are<00:03:35.739> working<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.640> know

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
while the others are working on you know

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.280 
while the others are working on you know
the<00:03:37.150> right<00:03:37.330> side<00:03:37.600> or<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.780> left<00:03:37.900> side<00:03:38.019> whatever

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
the right side or the left side whatever

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.650 
the right side or the left side whatever
so<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.940> know<00:03:39.970> if<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.209> split<00:03:40.420> up<00:03:40.540> it

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
so it just you know if you split up it

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.610 
so it just you know if you split up it
goes<00:03:40.750> twice<00:03:41.290> as<00:03:41.440> fast<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:43.140> once<00:03:44.140> once<00:03:44.500> you've

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
goes twice as fast so once once you've

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.570 
goes twice as fast so once once you've
killed<00:03:44.739> all<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.920> trash<00:03:45.100> you're<00:03:45.280> ready<00:03:45.400> for

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
killed all the trash you're ready for

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.570 
killed all the trash you're ready for
the<00:03:45.670> boss<00:03:45.850> and<00:03:46.120> we'll<00:03:46.840> continue<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
the boss and we'll continue it so the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.820 
the boss and we'll continue it so the
boss<00:03:48.700> fight<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.330> south<00:03:50.140> Aryan<00:03:50.470> is<00:03:50.620> pretty

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
boss fight for south Aryan is pretty

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.009 
boss fight for south Aryan is pretty
straightforward<00:03:51.100> it's<00:03:51.610> pretty<00:03:52.090> easy<00:03:52.239> you

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
straightforward it's pretty easy you

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.830 
straightforward it's pretty easy you
know<00:03:53.110> it's<00:03:53.350> just<00:03:53.560> one<00:03:53.769> of<00:03:53.830> those<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.810> know

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
know it's just one of those you know

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.430 
know it's just one of those you know
slash-and-burn<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:58.299> get<00:03:58.570> down<00:03:58.780> as<00:03:59.260> fast

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
slash-and-burn and I get down as fast

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.920 
slash-and-burn and I get down as fast
you<00:03:59.650> can<00:03:59.860> kind<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.280> fight<00:04:00.570> especially<00:04:01.570> on<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
you can kind of fight especially on the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.810 
you can kind of fight especially on the
10-man<00:04:02.200> it's<00:04:02.410> really<00:04:02.590> easy<00:04:02.769> there's<00:04:03.489> really

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
10-man it's really easy there's really

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.690 
10-man it's really easy there's really
no<00:04:04.330> mechanics<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.900> have<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.080> worry<00:04:05.260> about<00:04:05.700> but

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
no mechanics you have to worry about but

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.960 
no mechanics you have to worry about but
in<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.850> 25-man<00:04:07.450> there<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:08.670> there's<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.760> few

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
in the 25-man there is there's a few

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.069 
in the 25-man there is there's a few
things<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.299> have<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.450> pay<00:04:10.660> attention<00:04:10.840> to

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
things you have to pay attention to

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.770 
things you have to pay attention to
which<00:04:12.360> ends<00:04:13.360> up<00:04:13.390> killing<00:04:13.630> us<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.989> think<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:15.780> you

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
which ends up killing us I think but you

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.300 
which ends up killing us I think but you
know<00:04:17.010> it's<00:04:18.010> really<00:04:18.130> easy<00:04:19.079> so<00:04:20.130> one<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
know it's really easy so one of the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.400 
know it's really easy so one of the
first<00:04:21.820> mechanics<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.539> have<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.780> pay

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
first mechanics you have to pay

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.800 
first mechanics you have to pay
attention<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.800> in<00:04:23.890> 25<00:04:24.340> men<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:25.510> fact<00:04:25.690> that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
attention to in 25 men is the fact that

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.630 
attention to in 25 men is the fact that
there's<00:04:26.440> going<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.650> be<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.770> giant<00:04:27.070> flame<00:04:27.430> wall

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
there's going to be a giant flame wall

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.890 
there's going to be a giant flame wall
like

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
like

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.260 
like
comes<00:04:28.020> up<00:04:28.610> you'll<00:04:29.610> see<00:04:29.790> it<00:04:29.880> in<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> few<00:04:30.030> minutes

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
comes up you'll see it in a few minutes

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.320 
comes up you'll see it in a few minutes
it's<00:04:30.870> pretty<00:04:31.169> easy<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.530> avoid<00:04:32.000> all<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.210> have

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
it's pretty easy to avoid all you have

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.560 
it's pretty easy to avoid all you have
to<00:04:33.419> do<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:35.490> know<00:04:35.580> there<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.300> all<00:04:36.479> you

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
to do is you know there it is so all you

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.270 
to do is you know there it is so all you
have<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.690> do<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.990> walk<00:04:37.410> out<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.250> just

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
have to do is walk out of it so just

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.270 
have to do is walk out of it so just
walk<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:39.479> know<00:04:39.509> a<00:04:39.600> few<00:04:39.810> steps<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.380> you're

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
walk you know a few steps and you're

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.210 
walk you know a few steps and you're
fine<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.690> that's<00:04:42.870> one<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.289> things<00:04:43.470> if

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
fine so that's one of the things if

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.529 
fine so that's one of the things if
you're<00:04:44.400> doing<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.669> in<00:04:44.820> heroic<00:04:45.180> mode<00:04:45.360> which

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
you're doing this in heroic mode which

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.159 
you're doing this in heroic mode which
you<00:04:45.630> don't<00:04:45.810> have<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.169> there's<00:04:46.800> also<00:04:48.169> like

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
you don't have to there's also like

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.689 
you don't have to there's also like
these<00:04:49.350> portals<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:50.009> have<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.220> go<00:04:50.340> into

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
these portals that you have to go into

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.159 
these portals that you have to go into
and<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.090> have<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.300> kill<00:04:51.449> eggs<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.990> blah<00:04:52.139> blah

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
and you have to kill eggs and blah blah

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.050 
and you have to kill eggs and blah blah
blah<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.680> don't<00:04:53.160> have<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.340> do<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:53.580> in<00:04:53.669> heroic

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
blah you don't have to do it in heroic

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.490 
blah you don't have to do it in heroic
mode<00:04:54.240> just<00:04:54.509> do<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.690> in<00:04:54.780> regular<00:04:54.930> mode<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.259> get

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
mode just do it in regular mode you get

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.920 
mode just do it in regular mode you get
the<00:04:55.620> mount<00:04:55.800> either<00:04:56.100> way<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.509> drakes<00:04:57.720> will

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
the mount either way so the drakes will

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.590 
the mount either way so the drakes will
come<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.229> attack<00:04:58.289> you<00:04:59.150> since<00:05:00.150> they<00:05:00.300> have<00:05:00.449> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
come and attack you since they have to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.279 
come and attack you since they have to
stay<00:05:00.750> alive

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
stay alive

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.100 
stay alive
don't<00:05:01.949> use<00:05:02.160> AoE<00:05:02.430> attacks<00:05:02.820> if<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.720> use<00:05:03.840> AoE

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
don't use AoE attacks if you use AoE

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.629 
don't use AoE attacks if you use AoE
attacks<00:05:04.500> you're<00:05:04.830> going<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.070> do<00:05:05.160> damage<00:05:05.460> to

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
attacks you're going to do damage to

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.490 
attacks you're going to do damage to
them<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:05.940> then<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.510> could<00:05:06.930> potentially<00:05:07.199> kill

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
them and then you could potentially kill

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.070 
them and then you could potentially kill
them<00:05:07.620> as<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:08.190> can<00:05:08.310> see<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:08.550> died<00:05:08.970> boss<00:05:09.900> is
