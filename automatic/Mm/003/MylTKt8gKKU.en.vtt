and by the way have I told you this

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.429 
and by the way have I told you this
thing<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.700> sold<00:02:13.939> for<00:02:14.180> only<00:02:14.360> three<00:02:14.959> hundred<00:02:15.379> and

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
thing is sold for only three hundred and

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.569 
thing is sold for only three hundred and
thirty<00:02:15.799> dollars<00:02:16.340> at<00:02:17.150> least<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.569> China<00:02:18.579> so

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
thirty dollars at least in China so

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.170 
thirty dollars at least in China so
let's<00:02:20.299> check<00:02:20.659> the<00:02:20.930> build<00:02:21.290> quality<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.909> any

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
let's check the build quality is it any

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.649 
let's check the build quality is it any
good<00:02:24.159> yes<00:02:25.159> it<00:02:25.670> actually<00:02:25.909> is<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:27.909> 150<00:02:28.909> 4<00:02:29.239> grams

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
good yes it actually is it's 150 4 grams

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.429 
good yes it actually is it's 150 4 grams
light<00:02:30.200> but<00:02:30.890> still<00:02:31.310> solid<00:02:31.970> as<00:02:32.090> rock<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.720> only<00:02:33.200> 8

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
light but still solid as rock and only 8

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.420 
light but still solid as rock and only 8
millimeters<00:02:34.280> thick<00:02:35.079> so<00:02:36.079> let's<00:02:36.590> get<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
millimeters thick so let's get to the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.030 
millimeters thick so let's get to the
design<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.450> design<00:02:38.689> of<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.409> phone<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:39.920> of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
design the design of the phone is of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.899 
design the design of the phone is of
course<00:02:40.220> very<00:02:40.790> hard<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.450> read<00:02:41.659> objectively

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
course very hard to read objectively

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.059 
course very hard to read objectively
personally<00:02:43.909> I<00:02:44.030> love<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.720> simple<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.409> he<00:02:45.829> lies

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
personally I love the simple and he lies

uncomfortable<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:08.060> hold<00:03:08.239> at<00:03:08.689> first<00:03:09.439> but<00:03:10.400> now

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
uncomfortable to hold at first but now

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.149 
uncomfortable to hold at first but now
after<00:03:10.909> one<00:03:11.450> week<00:03:11.629> of<00:03:11.840> use<00:03:12.109> I've<00:03:12.409> got<00:03:12.650> very<00:03:12.950> much

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
after one week of use I've got very much

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.390 
after one week of use I've got very much
used<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.909> and<00:03:14.090> must<00:03:14.750> say<00:03:15.139> it<00:03:15.650> isn't<00:03:16.340> so

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
used to it and must say it isn't so

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.699 
used to it and must say it isn't so
terrible<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.299> all<00:03:17.510> as<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.930> am<00:03:17.989> imagined<00:03:18.590> at

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
terrible at all as I am imagined at

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.819 
terrible at all as I am imagined at
first<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:20.120> back<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.900> phone<00:03:21.169> which<00:03:21.560> looks

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
first the back of the phone which looks

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.759 
first the back of the phone which looks
like<00:03:21.919> metal<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.849> actually<00:03:23.569> made<00:03:23.870> from<00:03:23.900> plastic

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
like metal is actually made from plastic

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.699 
like metal is actually made from plastic
but<00:03:25.549> V<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.150> case<00:03:26.419> of<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.810> phone<00:03:27.049> is<00:03:27.079> made<00:03:27.530> of

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
but V in a case of the phone is made of

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.699 
but V in a case of the phone is made of
aluminium<00:03:27.949> and<00:03:28.609> so<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.720> whole<00:03:29.930> phone<00:03:30.260> feels

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
aluminium and so the whole phone feels

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.580 
aluminium and so the whole phone feels
very<00:03:31.040> stiff<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.489> solid<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.079> piece<00:03:33.349> glass

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
very stiff and solid the one piece glass

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.750 
very stiff and solid the one piece glass
Ron<00:03:34.010> reinforces<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.239> too<00:03:35.659> of<00:03:35.900> course<00:03:36.760> this

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
Ron reinforces this too of course this

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.909 
Ron reinforces this too of course this
leads<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.569> feeling<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.379> back<00:03:39.650> is

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
leads to the feeling that the back is

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.550 
leads to the feeling that the back is
actually<00:03:40.519> made<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.970> aluminum<00:03:41.510> but<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.049> really

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
actually made of aluminum but I really

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.649 
actually made of aluminum but I really
don't<00:03:42.859> like<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:43.340> feeling<00:03:43.609> of<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.120> back<00:03:44.359> side

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
don't like the feeling of the back side

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.920 
don't like the feeling of the back side
it's<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.650> too<00:03:45.889> slick<00:03:46.129> to<00:03:46.430> smooth<00:03:46.849> not<00:03:47.720> much

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
it's just too slick to smooth not much

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.710 
it's just too slick to smooth not much
grip<00:03:48.229> there<00:03:48.489> but<00:03:49.489> maybe<00:03:49.879> that's<00:03:50.299> just<00:03:50.419> me

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
grip there but maybe that's just me

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.780 
grip there but maybe that's just me
because<00:03:51.199> I'm<00:03:51.409> spoiled<00:03:51.769> by<00:03:52.129> the<00:03:52.190> soft<00:03:52.549> touch

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790
