the fence pickets are six feet high

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.170 
the fence pickets are six feet high
that's<00:00:23.680> how<00:00:23.800> they<00:00:23.949> come<00:00:24.160> from<00:00:24.460> Home<00:00:24.730> Depot<00:00:25.150> or

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.849 
that's how they come from Home Depot or
anywhere<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:27.839> what<00:00:28.839> we<00:00:28.929> use<00:00:29.080> on<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.410> back<00:00:29.619> to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
anywhere and what we use on the back to

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.290 
anywhere and what we use on the back to
attach<00:00:30.160> them<00:00:30.460> together<00:00:30.609> so<00:00:31.029> they<00:00:31.119> wouldn't

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
attach them together so they wouldn't

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.610 
attach them together so they wouldn't
move<00:00:31.449> is<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.720> 1<00:00:32.439> by<00:00:32.650> 4<00:00:33.330> 4<00:00:34.330> a<00:00:34.360> 1<00:00:34.570> by<00:00:34.750> 3<00:00:34.780> either<00:00:35.290> one

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
move is a 1 by 4 4 a 1 by 3 either one

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.040 
move is a 1 by 4 4 a 1 by 3 either one
you<00:00:35.650> can<00:00:35.949> use<00:00:36.449> and<00:00:37.449> we<00:00:37.540> just<00:00:37.720> screwed<00:00:37.930> that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
you can use and we just screwed that

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.420 
you can use and we just screwed that
into<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.410> back<00:00:38.559> of<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.769> fence<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:39.220> no

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
into the back of the fence so that no

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.830 
into the back of the fence so that no
screws<00:00:40.110> show<00:00:41.110> in<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.610> front

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
screws show in the front

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.650 
screws show in the front
then<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.220> fence<00:00:46.490> pickets<00:00:46.700> are<00:00:46.970> about<00:00:47.120> $2<00:00:47.630> a

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
then the fence pickets are about $2 a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.630 
then the fence pickets are about $2 a
piece<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.230> they're<00:00:48.350> not<00:00:48.530> very<00:00:48.710> expensive<00:00:48.980> and

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
piece so they're not very expensive and

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.100 
piece so they're not very expensive and
then<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:50.420> can't<00:00:50.720> paint<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.850> pickets<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.150> you

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
then you can't paint the pickets and you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.770 
then you can't paint the pickets and you
need<00:00:54.290> rope<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.310> there's<00:00:55.790> not<00:00:55.880> too<00:00:55.940> many<00:00:56.180> too

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
need rope so there's not too many too

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.350 
need rope so there's not too many too
many<00:00:56.810> things<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.410> do<00:00:57.610> but<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.670> can<00:00:59.030> see<00:00:59.210> that

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
many things to do but you can see that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.350 
many things to do but you can see that
it<00:00:59.480> displays<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.990> sunglasses<00:01:00.850> very<00:01:01.850> nice<00:01:02.030> and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
it displays the sunglasses very nice and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.790 
it displays the sunglasses very nice and
evenly<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.710> spacing<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.309> really<00:01:04.550> good<00:01:04.760> I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
evenly and the spacing is really good I

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.460 
evenly and the spacing is really good I
cut<00:01:06.800> these<00:01:06.980> ones<00:01:07.310> shorter<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:07.940> sides<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.750> 4

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
cut these ones shorter on the sides to 4

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.760 
cut these ones shorter on the sides to 4
feet<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:10.760> they<00:01:10.910> fit<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.300> booth<00:01:11.570> space

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
feet so they fit this booth space

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.679 
feet so they fit this booth space
so<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.790> basically<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:17.009> attach<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
so all you do basically is you attach I

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.940 
so all you do basically is you attach I
painted<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.840> first<00:01:19.079> I<00:01:19.350> painted<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.799> fence

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
painted it first I painted the fence

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
painted it first I painted the fence
pickets<00:01:20.250> first<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> attached<00:01:21.540> them

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
pickets first and then I attached them

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
pickets first and then I attached them
to<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.920> back<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.729> drilled<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> holes

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to the back and then I drilled the holes

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.389 
to the back and then I drilled the holes
you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> rope<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.220> goes

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
you can see that the rope just goes

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.779 
you can see that the rope just goes
through<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> holes<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> back

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
through the holes and then on the back

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.510 
through the holes and then on the back
both<00:01:29.789> sides<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.330> just<00:01:30.360> tied<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
both sides are just tied so that it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.880 
both sides are just tied so that it
doesn't<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:32.850> back<00:01:32.909> through<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:34.289> it's<00:01:34.710> pretty

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
doesn't come back through so it's pretty

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550 
doesn't come back through so it's pretty
simple<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.640> fence<00:01:35.970> pickets<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.929> six<00:01:37.320> feet

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
simple the fence pickets are six feet

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.279 
simple the fence pickets are six feet
high<00:01:37.640> at<00:01:38.640> Home<00:01:38.789> Depot<00:01:38.820> under<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> 5.5<00:01:40.080> inch

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
high at Home Depot under the 5.5 inch

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.080 
high at Home Depot under the 5.5 inch
ones<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.250> could<00:01:41.399> use<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.759> three-and-a-half

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
ones you could use the three-and-a-half

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.010 
ones you could use the three-and-a-half
inch<00:01:42.450> ones<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:44.600> thought<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.810> looked

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
inch ones but I thought this looked

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.430 
inch ones but I thought this looked
better<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.860> went<00:01:47.039> use<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:48.259> it's<00:01:49.259> pretty

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
better so we went use this it's pretty

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.279 
better so we went use this it's pretty
simple<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.039> make<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:51.080> behind<00:01:52.080> the

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
simple to make you can see behind the

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.740 
simple to make you can see behind the
board<00:01:52.500> there's<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.700> by<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.690> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
board there's the one by I think it's a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.529 
board there's the one by I think it's a
1<00:01:54.869> by<00:01:55.020> 4<00:01:55.049> could<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:55.979> 1<00:01:56.130> by<00:01:56.250> 300<00:01:57.030> yeah<00:01:57.179> it's<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.420> 1

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
1 by 4 could be 1 by 300 yeah it's a 1

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.609 
1 by 4 could be 1 by 300 yeah it's a 1
by<00:01:57.659> 4<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:59.630> okay<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.929> screw<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.319> in<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
by 4 and okay just screw that in the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.800 
by 4 and okay just screw that in the
back<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.039> then<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.190> screwed<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> into<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.209> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
back and then I screwed it into the to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
back and then I screwed it into the to
the<00:02:03.840> booth<00:02:04.080> wall<00:02:04.409> right<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> so
