it really is tough it forces you to
scramble<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> little<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
scramble a little bit but I think you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.749 
scramble a little bit but I think you
can<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.650> pretty<00:01:25.770> well<00:01:26.009> cuz<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.460> come<00:01:26.640> back

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
can do pretty well cuz you can come back

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.429 
can do pretty well cuz you can come back
with<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> wide<00:01:27.180> receiver<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> second<00:01:28.320> round
