00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.160 
know glimpse of what black ops ii will
look<00:03:25.220> like<00:03:25.400> i<00:03:25.670> mean<00:03:26.060> i<00:03:26.120> think<00:03:26.180> last<00:03:26.450> year<00:03:26.720> at<00:03:26.989> e3

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
look like i mean i think last year at e3

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.110 
look like i mean i think last year at e3
they<00:03:27.530> showed<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.799> little<00:03:28.100> bit<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.430> what<00:03:28.670> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
they showed a little bit of what the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.539 
they showed a little bit of what the
mono<00:03:29.299> 43<00:03:29.810> campaign<00:03:30.290> will<00:03:30.470> look<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.739> I<00:03:31.040> think

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
mono 43 campaign will look like I think

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.340 
mono 43 campaign will look like I think
they<00:03:31.670> showed<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.090> mission<00:03:32.389> black<00:03:32.660> Tuesday<00:03:33.170> or

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
they showed the mission black Tuesday or

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.840 
they showed the mission black Tuesday or
something<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.829> don't<00:03:33.889> know<00:03:34.040> they<00:03:34.430> showed<00:03:34.670> one

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
something I don't know they showed one

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.610 
something I don't know they showed one
of<00:03:34.880> those<00:03:35.030> missions<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:36.230> gave<00:03:36.380> us<00:03:36.530> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
of those missions and it gave us a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.800 
of those missions and it gave us a
little<00:03:36.739> taste<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.250> what<00:03:37.310> black<00:03:37.700> ups<00:03:37.910> or<00:03:38.150> what

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
little taste of what black ups or what

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.720 
little taste of what black ups or what
model<00:03:39.109> for<00:03:39.290> 3<00:03:39.470> will<00:03:39.620> look<00:03:39.709> like<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.099> hopefully

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
model for 3 will look like and hopefully

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.330 
model for 3 will look like and hopefully
they<00:03:40.880> do<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.120> with<00:03:41.480> black<00:03:41.720> ops<00:03:41.989> 2<00:03:42.530> because

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
they do that with black ops 2 because

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.979
