 Chris Kaman 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 but I assure you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 I still remember what I liked 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430

 nothing is the rising there is nothing 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.120
 the door of the day in the classic they stand before this message 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.120
 Often I had to compete for a friendly match 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.160
 and it started when he had been there for a long time 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.980
 in the time I was in quotes 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980
 Now I am not active anymore 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.520
 were present 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.480
 it is for every man and woman because i think that will 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.420
 March is too perfect again 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.850
 Heesters percent 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.850

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.180
 Bing 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 just under 90 of course I'm thinking so we have 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.520
 completely free again because I believe that also a realization from the time for 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.270
 me 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.910
 that is going to be 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.830
 the final shooting far too big 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.330
 Pacifist will definitely come out very differently and the label is content 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.609
 not at all so can the heart and min 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.609

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.899
 the couple has been believing since 1970 just not at all 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.779
 because then the feeling that the pendulum or 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.869
 So I have to say 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.709
 to possess the bad 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.049

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.969
 Stephen Bosworth does not know her 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.699
 we want something completely different 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.699
 was impressively exemplary 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.879

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.329
 first determined 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.089
 to distribute that certain groups 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.269
 the assumption and Dr 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.459
 Everything you use for your own purposes 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.929
 but still 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.929
 there are fewer radicals and there are 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.769
 to spend the Muslim faith in schools 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.179
 be regulated in the future 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:22.759
 then can 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.990
 meanwhile come the admonitory words 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.319

 Do not believe that we can win 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.459
 everyone in his own faction and at least once a week 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.959
 who leads who wins 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.979
 I have for myself 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.979
 Team Alonso finishes 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.399
