00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.700
 it's called no te no items is a very 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.340
 useful consists of a single utility that is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.250
 we open the inventory and here we do not have 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.810
 nothing press the key or and we get everything 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.670
 this and this we have here to the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.310
 left and next too for 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 close it open whatever it is and that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 we can do with all this because a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 simple click we can give it if 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.769

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.590
 I give everything or we can also have it in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.690
 recipe mode by giving you here and what 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.430
 we want to do it puts us as it is done by 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.640
 example I do not remember how the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.149
 so it's a very useful mode and now 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.309
 let's see how it is installed once 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.629
 downloaded the three modes we enter the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.990
 bill and in minecraft open with winter 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.340
 rent for this we need to have 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.800
 winrar obviously we close this we erase 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 Folder times 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.820
 and we come back we minimize all this and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.650
 we open minecraft forge we delete here 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.540
 also the meta folder ins 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.710
 and we move all the files to minecraft 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.240

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.030

 we give enter gale 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.830

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.700
 which is a normal thing to happen that we 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.240
 look weird 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 we can close it and the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.080
 minecraft forge mod and now here we
