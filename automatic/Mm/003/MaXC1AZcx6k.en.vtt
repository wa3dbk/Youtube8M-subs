00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
hi I'm Gabby a few years ago some koopa

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.369 
hi I'm Gabby a few years ago some koopa
from<00:00:05.730> xerox<00:00:06.089> asked<00:00:06.569> me<00:00:06.660> if<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.899> would<00:00:06.960> help<00:00:07.200> at

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
from xerox asked me if I would help at

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.549 
from xerox asked me if I would help at
one<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.649> their<00:00:07.799> meetings<00:00:07.919> here's<00:00:08.849> my<00:00:09.030> big<00:00:09.269> hole

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
one of their meetings here's my big hole

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.470 
one of their meetings here's my big hole
so<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> waste<00:00:10.920> created<00:00:11.280> by<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.030> solid<00:00:12.360> ink

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
so the waste created by the solid ink

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.259 
so the waste created by the solid ink
printer<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.110> considerably<00:00:13.860> less<00:00:14.130> how<00:00:15.030> much

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
printer is considerably less how much

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.550 
printer is considerably less how much
less<00:00:15.509> well<00:00:16.230> let's<00:00:16.440> compare<00:00:17.960> after<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:18.990> saw<00:00:19.289> that

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
less well let's compare after I saw that

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.260 
less well let's compare after I saw that
I<00:00:19.859> couldn't<00:00:20.279> understand<00:00:20.730> why<00:00:20.850> anyone

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
I couldn't understand why anyone

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.870 
I couldn't understand why anyone
wouldn't<00:00:21.750> buy<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> salad<00:00:22.560> increment<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.670> like

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
wouldn't buy a salad increment but like

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.810 
wouldn't buy a salad increment but like
hello<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.230> eight<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.189> i<00:00:26.220> made<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> video

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
hello I was eight so i made this video

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
hello I was eight so i made this video
to<00:00:27.150> find<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.960> business<00:00:28.470> reasons<00:00:28.890> or

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
to find out all the business reasons or

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.160 
to find out all the business reasons or
solve<00:00:29.609> ink<00:00:29.880> printers<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:30.840> better

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
solve ink printers really are better

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
solve ink printers really are better
because<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:32.099> I'll<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.460> people<00:00:32.850> will

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
because then I'll know that people will

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
because then I'll know that people will
lie<00:00:33.180> lots<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.690> lots<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.350> think<00:00:34.680> that's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
lie lots and lots of them I think that's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.850 
lie lots and lots of them I think that's

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.620 
make sure the eggs of the highest
quality<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.400> of<00:02:00.700> really<00:02:00.940> consistent<00:02:01.540> quality

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
quality and of really consistent quality

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.210 
quality and of really consistent quality
because<00:02:02.080> that's<00:02:02.229> what<00:02:02.410> our<00:02:02.500> customers<00:02:02.680> need

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
because that's what our customers need

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.850 
because that's what our customers need
so<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.030> could<00:02:04.330> see<00:02:04.509> why<00:02:04.690> style<00:02:04.990> ink<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.590> better

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
so I could see why style ink is better

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.340 
so I could see why style ink is better
for<00:02:06.100> customers<00:02:06.550> today<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.869> why<00:02:08.020> will<00:02:08.229> they

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
for customers today but why will they

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.070 
for customers today but why will they
still<00:02:08.590> want<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:08.920> tomorrow<00:02:10.080> salting

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
still want it tomorrow salting
