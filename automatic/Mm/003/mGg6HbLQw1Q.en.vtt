another island onward these ocean biomes

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.039 
another island onward these ocean biomes
are<00:01:19.790> huge<00:01:22.299> bigger<00:01:23.299> than<00:01:23.450> any<00:01:23.600> other<00:01:23.840> regular

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.819 

next<00:01:29.750> thing<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.079> want<00:01:30.289> to<00:01:30.350> actually<00:01:30.439> try

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
next thing that I want to actually try

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.789 
next thing that I want to actually try
to<00:01:30.860> find<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.939> going<00:01:32.719> to<00:01:32.899> be<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:34.090> swamp<00:01:35.090> by<00:01:35.329> own

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
to find is going to be a swamp by own

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.050 
to find is going to be a swamp by own
now<00:01:36.799> some<00:01:37.009> changes<00:01:37.429> have<00:01:37.549> been<00:01:37.670> made<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.909> the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
now some changes have been made to the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.419 
now some changes have been made to the
swamp<00:01:38.450> biomes<00:01:38.929> and<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:41.649> think<00:01:42.649> they<00:01:43.280> look

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
swamp biomes and I think they look

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.910 
swamp biomes and I think they look
pretty<00:01:43.899> freaking<00:01:44.899> cool<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:48.140> hopefully<00:01:48.679> we<00:01:48.799> can

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
pretty freaking cool so hopefully we can

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.160 
pretty freaking cool so hopefully we can
come<00:01:49.039> across<00:01:49.189> one<00:01:49.610> here<00:01:49.939> actually<00:01:50.810> tell<00:01:51.110> you

let's<00:02:46.069> see<00:02:46.340> there's<00:02:47.299> another<00:02:47.510> one<00:02:47.690> over<00:02:47.720> there

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
let's see there's another one over there

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.039 
let's see there's another one over there
really<00:02:49.310> pads<00:02:49.780> jump<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.850> can<00:02:53.000> see<00:02:53.299> there's<00:02:53.959> a

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
really pads jump you can see there's a

really pads jump you can see there's a
river<00:02:54.350> cutting<00:02:54.829> through<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.250> swamp<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.940> you

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
river cutting through the swamp and you

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.059 
river cutting through the swamp and you
can<00:02:56.510> see<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.930> difference<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:57.530> color<00:02:57.799> between

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
and I don't know if that's a bug or if

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.289 
and I don't know if that's a bug or if
they<00:03:06.410> actually<00:03:06.590> want<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.160> water<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.609> change

one other thing I wanted to look at and
do<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.269> at<00:03:14.599> sea<00:03:15.109> where<00:03:15.859> is<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.670> got<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:18.010> hop

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
do that at sea where is it I got to hop

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.920 
do that at sea where is it I got to hop
down<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.700> real<00:03:19.880> quick

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.860 

and<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.780> get<00:03:25.900> some<00:03:26.019> light<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.290> here<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.780> you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and we get some light in here and you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.349 
and we get some light in here and you
can<00:03:28.930> see<00:03:29.219> when<00:03:30.219> the<00:03:30.310> water<00:03:30.519> is<00:03:30.670> falling<00:03:31.000> it

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
can see when the water is falling it

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.809 
can see when the water is falling it
still<00:03:31.629> has<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:31.930> green<00:03:32.290> tinted<00:03:33.189> shimmer<00:03:33.549> to

a<00:04:52.539> trail<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.780> snow<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.139> have<00:04:53.349> been<00:04:53.500> able<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.680> find

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
a trail of snow I have been able to find

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.100 
a trail of snow I have been able to find
a<00:04:54.070> snow<00:04:54.310> biome<00:04:54.729> anyway<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.690> don't<00:04:55.900> think

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
a snow biome anyway I don't think

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.430 
a snow biome anyway I don't think
they've<00:04:56.229> been<00:04:56.409> added<00:04:56.889> yet<00:04:57.099> um<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:59.229> I'm<00:04:59.320> not

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
they've been added yet um so I'm not

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.930 
they've been added yet um so I'm not
sure<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.800> don't<00:04:59.979> know<00:05:00.070> if<00:05:00.159> the<00:05:00.250> snow<00:05:00.310> will<00:05:00.669> melt

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
sure I don't know if the snow will melt

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.510 
sure I don't know if the snow will melt
hasn't<00:05:01.509> started<00:05:01.570> melting<00:05:01.930> yet<00:05:02.500> as<00:05:02.830> far<00:05:03.099> as<00:05:03.370> I

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
hasn't started melting yet as far as I

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.870 
hasn't started melting yet as far as I
can<00:05:03.580> tell<00:05:04.860> though<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.009> snow<00:05:06.190> is<00:05:06.400> supposed<00:05:06.520> to

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
can tell though the snow is supposed to

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.980 
can tell though the snow is supposed to
melt<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.270> hotter<00:05:07.539> biomes<00:05:08.139> and<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:10.150> think<00:05:10.750> the

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
melt and hotter biomes and I think the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.110 
melt and hotter biomes and I think the
snow<00:05:11.199> golem<00:05:11.620> itself<00:05:12.039> is<00:05:12.190> also<00:05:12.520> supposed<00:05:12.880> to

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
snow golem itself is also supposed to

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.290 
snow golem itself is also supposed to
melt<00:05:14.130> but<00:05:15.130> that<00:05:15.250> is<00:05:15.370> just<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.699> really<00:05:16.000> neat

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
melt but that is just a really neat
