00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 today we will do the unboxing to samsung 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:14.009
 galaxy 4 and a welcome environment 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.400
 again to your technology channel as 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.800
 come we have the s5 released very recently 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.199
 time and let's do the unboxing 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.449
 quickly this model is the bus 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.480
 mobile this model will offer us 4 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.269
 2.5 processor cores and from the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.279
 box will bring the kitkat version 4.4 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.430
 point 2 of android but let's see what 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.010
 It has this box more inside obviously 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.379
 they always offer us a manual this 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.270
 unfortunately it does not come in Spanish but 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.059
 gives us what is instructions that never 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.100
 We have if you are a kick and really you 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.860
 and we went a little bit more to the box and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.440
 let's find what the charger is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.289
 talking about the charger the battery is going to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.480
 be 2,800 children and today let's go to 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.640
 the hearing aids now these are the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.980
 regular that brings samsung normally to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
 I personally do not like them but other 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 detail that we can see is that it brings to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.600
 raise and lower volume and more inside of 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.710
 box 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 other days that depends on the size 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.640
 from your ear we also find in the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.009
 box the charger this is going to be only 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.900
 compatible now with the s5 and the know 3 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.880
 since they made the same move as 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.860
 apple and now we separate everything and we're going to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 see this device more closely 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.659
 we started by taking away the protection that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.979
 bring from the factory and from the back 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.979
 we noticed a new texture 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.140
 if we go to the front 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.240
 we see the screen 5.1 that the truth 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.750
 it costs a bit to have it in your hand if you 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.600
 We compared his older brother the No. 3 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.760
 we notice that the difference is very little 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.130
 nowadays but you can still manage 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.830
 much more with a hand compared to the know 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.020
 3 the truth that it is huge even though I 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.210
 I have a very big hand, it costs me a lot 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.010
 handle the note with one hand a 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.750
 which I am very anxious to try is 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.920
 the galaxy guides through the screen 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 in front we find a screen 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.120
 1080 full on the sides 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.730
 we found the buttons that we found 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.230
 normally go up lower volume turn it off 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.600
 this device will offer us a 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.150
 16 megapixel camera and also a 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.710
 pretty good speaker and samsung does not 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.450
 the same play remains can we change the 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.090
 charger and gives us this horrible thing 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.760
 that to cover to finalize includes in 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.500
 the box hearing aids pads what is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.450
 loader and also in brick 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.390
 electricity already last we only have left 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.090
 turn on this device and do the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.110
 share up that was extremely fascinating 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.730
