the person I ordered two teams it's a
different<00:00:33.600> 10<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> got<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> other<00:00:34.170> one

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260

which<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.880> probably<00:00:36.059> guess<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.960> another

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
which you can probably guess for another

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080 
which you can probably guess for another
video<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:38.280> basically<00:00:38.670> taped<00:00:39.000> around

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
video but they basically taped around

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
video but they basically taped around
the<00:00:39.270> edge<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.960> combine<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> tints

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the edge and like combine the tints

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440 
the edge and like combine the tints
together<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.430> mailed<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.820> don't

together when they mailed them don't
know<00:00:42.510> why<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.809> guess<00:00:43.200> they're<00:00:43.320> trying<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> make

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
know why I guess they're trying to make

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.500 
know why I guess they're trying to make
a<00:00:43.649> legendary<00:00:44.100> super<00:00:44.399> tin<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.760> don't<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.239> I

a legendary super tin I don't know I
don't<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.399> idea<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:47.969> had

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
don't know what kind of idea they had

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
don't know what kind of idea they had
going<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.110> anyway<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.680> had<00:00:50.070> been

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
going with that but anyway it had been

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
going with that but anyway it had been
tampered<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.180> somebody<00:00:51.539> did

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
tampered with it's just somebody did

tampered with it's just somebody did
that<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.350> some<00:00:52.890> strange<00:00:53.100> reason<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.699> guess<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that for some strange reason I guess the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240

this<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.430> has<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.670> three<00:02:42.849> photon<00:02:43.239> shock

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
this one has the three photon shock

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.600 
this one has the three photon shock
waves<00:02:43.660> or<00:02:44.110> okay<00:02:44.680> that's<00:02:44.920> one<00:02:45.099> photon

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
waves or okay that's one photon

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.920 
waves or okay that's one photon
shockwave<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.970> then<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:46.750> order

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
shockwave and then I think you order

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.970 
shockwave and then I think you order
chaos<00:02:47.819> it's<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.090> dholka<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.080> illuminate<00:02:50.799> and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
chaos it's the dholka and illuminate and

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.870 
chaos it's the dholka and illuminate and
I<00:02:51.040> think<00:02:51.220> they<00:02:51.280> have<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.670> three

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I think they have like the three

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.699 
I think they have like the three
shockwave<00:02:52.299> which<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.349> always<00:02:53.500> thought<00:02:53.590> was

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
shockwave which I always thought was

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.809 
shockwave which I always thought was
kind<00:02:53.799> of<00:02:53.890> weird<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:57.160> right<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.519> evil
