00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 Why did you study today that you can unite 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.139
 because with this you about the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.049
 whether or not to remove a cuticle is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.450
 I'm in favor of not taking away already 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.090
 many years that I took mine in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.279
 five year affair that I do not shoot 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.039
 once we were all week 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.769
 I took it and got to take it like that on Friday 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.769
 so it was often that they had 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.120
 bowl deep well same location one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.600
 know when I use the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.090
 Enamels 2010 is like it many blogs 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.640
 gringos and boss ac brazilians 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.610
 mainly daniel honorato of tomorrow 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.090
 that she thought of products that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.890
 herself created to help people to 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.149
 elza 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.460
 then very difficult at first but it is not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.489
 the intention to remove part with 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.809
 something very Brazilian eth comes from 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.939
 many generations 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.340
 in almost all other countries do not have 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.409
 That 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.049
 this custom of removing the cuticles 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.060
 if you know that I can not lines you 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.540
 You will see that the vast majority end up not 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.540
 they remove if necessary the forest and I access 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.150
 neither a bath nor take the title 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.549
 and here in Brazil the vast majority in 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.600
 half the flags of one is difficult but that 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.060
 take one and they were adapting, right? 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.060
 Come on, it's so hard to take away. 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.270
 really hard 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.830
 we had one thing always the canopy 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.590
 not even something is done is free 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:54.980
 does not have his will but is technologies and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.550
 doctors and people let's say so trained 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.520
 in whom is an endless health area that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.130
 to prove withdrawal because the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.030
 cuticle natural protection against 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.620
 of microorganisms 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.530
 very difficult to take something when 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.920
 I quit and dedicate myself to other 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.650
 people that I'm a tv always and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.780
 locked in 160 so I always had 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.120
 moisturizer in the bag and work goals 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.610
 to even test computer 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.310
 the moisturizer on the tub head in the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.560
 position of the week left important as well 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.660
 will be in the whole house because when I 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.340
 accept me because of his 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.260
 first week in the first weeks 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.980
 that you leave the skin starts to get 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.230
 the thicker the dry one begins in the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.750
 access does not come from 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.900
 everything together she is born a little there 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.610
 It was time consuming and if you present to 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.700
 to withdraw you have to leave that 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.260
 do not stay treated, just 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.269
 riches are becoming more 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.120
 does not appear with the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.190
 other chickens know another thing 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.280
 It helped me a lot when I decided not to 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.410
 It was over so I'm going to stop and 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.420
 You do not get that you go. 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.810
 stopping gradually 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.790
 When you take out on the other you have not been 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.459
 you can still see everything from drugs to 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.800
 two weeks that you do not withdraw in a 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.980
 you exit knowing that a little 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.540
 she stopped studying the nut on the stud 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.610
 for themselves and will not get it 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.280
 hard to see that no mistake much 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.280
 it's that hard 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.270
 he taught madly and he shot at goal 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.740
 one month will be two super controlled in 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.090
 week that takes care of the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.950
 hydration 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.910
 everything was done again said that it had 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.800
 so it's this kind of tension thing 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.040
 another thing that helps a lot too and I 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.150
 we are the products to soften 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.580
 I 'll join you because you too 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.560

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.070
 the whole dead line leave mine 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.560
 daughter, the decision came to the question 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.470
 this couple at home as facilitates 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.049
 you do not withdraw because if you would like 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.540
 well housed 40 minutes to make 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.900
 nail sátão I'm going to stay instead 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.390
 because you do not have to withdraw too 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.760
 your reservations and I can hear a 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.090
 A song for you, how many do 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.550
