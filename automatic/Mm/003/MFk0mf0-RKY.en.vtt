00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello how I hope you find yourself 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.319
 the best I am gil the one in charge of 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.120
 remove your your and this time we are going to 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.160
 review the correct techniques for 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.050
 place follow this video is a 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.700
 enlargement of the previous video in which 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.680
 explain the correct techniques for 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.630
 touch with the left hand in this 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.279
 video will provide you with a series of tips 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.400
 so you can place your chair with 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.589
 greater accuracy as well as a series of 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.900
 exercises for what power is your 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.460
 ability to place the nut 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.230
 first and most important that you have to 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.630
 review like most videos 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.300
 that I have climbed lately is the posture 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.980
 you have to place the chords for 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.930
 I have a video on my channel in the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.150
 which explained a series of positions for 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.040
 that you choose the one you like most but 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.230
 personally I recommend that for 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.010
 place properly is to say that if 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.379
 you can not put it 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
 of limits to two particular positions 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.120
 the academic position that is to be placed 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.090
 the guitar on the left leg with 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.280
 this inclination 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.560
 or the posture that looks like 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.770
 which is to place the guitar in the 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.630
 right leg but with the inclination 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.030
 a bit like the academic position 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.010
 this position is not the one taught 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.650
 the music conservatories but you will 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.970
 It seems a lot and also brings you everything 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.180
 that brings you or in large part 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.890
 the academic position well to start 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.760
 we have to be clear that the drought 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.160
 it is put with the index finger covering all 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.640
 the strings of a fret in particular and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.229
 then the other fingers are placed 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.080
 in relation to the position that you choose 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.180
 if it is this or the academic you are going to give 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.190
 account that there are several points of 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.550
 support on this occasion we will place 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.909
 as an example a minor if it is about 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.650
 follow the first fret middle finger on the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.420
 third fret of the second string and 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.380
 little finger and ring finger in the room 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.479
 fret of the third and fourth string 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.060
 well let's have several points of 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.710
 support that I'm only going to have with the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.990
 academic position or with this position 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.960
 that looks a bit like I'm going to have to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 this region of the guitar is 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.670
 resting on the middle of my thigh that 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.970
 this portion is supported on 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.950
 my chest and that lies hug is about 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.200
 this portion which is going to 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.170
 provide greater grip and greater 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.819
 force for it to be able to place virile not 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.920
 it is said that the inclination a little towards 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.569
 up it's going to be a little easier for me 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.610
 work because I am going to be able to 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.260
 do this move backwards to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.019
 be able to exert more pressure on the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.870
 guitar actually stand chair not 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.120
 it's so much strength is a little more than 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.519
 skill however at the beginning 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.100
 I need is strength and I the personal 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.989
 I know because I pressed the guitar with 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.019
 a lot of firmness so that I could leave 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.080
 this sound at the beginning also comes out 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.630
 a little bit mute some strings are mounted 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.690
 others do not but that's normal and what 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.799
 It is advisable not to stop practicing if 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.610
 you find yourself in the position 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.650
 academic 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.530
 I will place the same posture only 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.260
 that lower down because you can not see 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.190
 it's a little easier to do this because of 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.860
 that based on 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.120
 this point of support the fulcrum and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.920
 this point of support 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.100
 I will have even more strength to be able 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.380
 place my here 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.240
 I do not recommend you to do brute force 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.790
 about the guitar however I know that 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.380
 at the beginning it is extremely important that 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.480
 you do because even though I 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.400
 try, it's not going to come out in time 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.590
 hand would know how to get used to it and accommodate us 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.360
 in such a way that you do not do as much force and 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.370
 you realize that actually the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.710
 strength that is exercised and you have it with 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.080
 these three fingers and that the middle 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.990
 you just have to make an effort 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.280
 first and the fifth string and the sixth if 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.810
 is the case 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.660
 this detail that I just mentioned 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.690
 is what we are about to treat as 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.690
 I mentioned the capo really is not 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.300
 cover all the frets because 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.760
 always a posture I got has the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.560
 support of other fingers for example for the 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.860
 yes minor had to place these three 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.140
 fingers do not have to kill you force 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.510
 these three frets you just have to 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.300
 really press the first the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.540
 fifth and the sixth so your finger can 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.370
 make like a slight curve in the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.680
 which is just pressing up and 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.760
 below and you are supporting yourself by these three 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.100
 sides so you can tell that 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.180
 it's not so much strength if that is not a 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.180
 little bit more skill 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.080
 in relation to this position we already have a 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.000
 little tips now let's review 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.510
 the other position in relation to the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.350
 minors that is 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.700
 a minor sustained this time the 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.130
 which one is to follow in the first 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.330
 fret and ring finger and little finger on the 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.330
 fourth and fifth fret 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.400
 and it was seen on video please support me
