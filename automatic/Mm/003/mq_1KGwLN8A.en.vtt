00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.590 
something kind of interesting is arugula
is<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> good<00:02:27.190> thing<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.430> use<00:02:27.460> I'll<00:02:28.450> just

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
is it is a good thing to use I'll just

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.220 
is it is a good thing to use I'll just
pour<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.830> else<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.570> have<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.960> nice

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
pour what else I can so I have a nice

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
pour what else I can so I have a nice
full<00:02:32.620> filling<00:02:33.220> there<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.100> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
full filling there and just like the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.100 
full filling there and just like the
Lorraine<00:02:39.550> quiche<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:40.060> made<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.660> can<00:02:40.840> throw

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
Lorraine quiche we made you can throw

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.440 
Lorraine quiche we made you can throw
this<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.440> oven<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.790> our<00:02:43.000> convection

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
this in the oven at in our convection

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.300 
this in the oven at in our convection
oven<00:02:43.660> it's<00:02:43.930> 325<00:02:44.860> degrees<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.890> home<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.160> an

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
oven it's 325 degrees in the home of an

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.590 
oven it's 325 degrees in the home of an
average<00:02:48.550> home<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.300> going<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.480> be

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
average home of and it's going to be

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.250 
average home of and it's going to be
somewhere<00:02:50.280> 375<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.400> 400<00:02:51.850> degrees<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.450> it'll

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
somewhere 375 to 400 degrees and it'll

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.280 
somewhere 375 to 400 degrees and it'll
take<00:02:53.440> 45<00:02:54.250> minutes<00:02:54.760> up<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.570> an<00:02:55.690> hour<00:02:55.900> depending

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
take 45 minutes up to an hour depending

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.890 
take 45 minutes up to an hour depending
on<00:02:57.220> your<00:02:57.670> oven<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.960> how<00:02:59.170> it's<00:02:59.350> calibrated<00:03:00.900> so

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
on your oven and how it's calibrated so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.900 
on your oven and how it's calibrated so
be<00:03:02.260> careful<00:03:02.620> it's<00:03:02.740> really<00:03:02.830> liquidy<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.490> it's

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
be careful it's really liquidy and it's

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.930 
be careful it's really liquidy and it's
easy<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.240> sort<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.600> let<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.080> overflow<00:03:05.820> but<00:03:06.820> I'm

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
easy to sort of let it overflow but I'm

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.640 
easy to sort of let it overflow but I'm
just<00:03:07.120> going<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.270> go<00:03:07.420> ahead<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.810> stick<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.230> in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
just going to go ahead and stick that in

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.260 
just going to go ahead and stick that in
the<00:03:08.770> oven<00:03:09.100> be<00:03:09.400> careful<00:03:09.730> when<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:09.910> put<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.150> in

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
the oven be careful when you put it in

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.110 
the oven be careful when you put it in
there<00:03:10.500> it'll<00:03:11.500> be<00:03:11.590> really<00:03:11.770> hot<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.480> here<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.050> our

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
there it'll be really hot so here is our

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.570 
there it'll be really hot so here is our
vegetables<00:03:16.120> mixed<00:03:16.630> vegetable<00:03:17.170> quiche<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.710> in

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
vegetables mixed vegetable quiche and in

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.430 
vegetables mixed vegetable quiche and in
this<00:03:18.880> one<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.450> cooked<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.870> little<00:03:20.020> longer

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
this one I cooked a little longer

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.370 
this one I cooked a little longer
because<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.910> has<00:03:22.240> more<00:03:22.510> moisture<00:03:22.810> from<00:03:23.320> the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
because it has more moisture from the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.130 
because it has more moisture from the
vegetables<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.180> takes<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.480> little<00:03:25.630> while<00:03:25.840> to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
vegetables so it takes a little while to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.900 
vegetables so it takes a little while to
get<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.470> moisture<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.250> set<00:03:27.490> up<00:03:27.670> with<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
get that moisture to set up with the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.810 
get that moisture to set up with the
eggs<00:03:28.209> but<00:03:29.140> once<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.190> ready<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.640> nice

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
eggs but once it's ready it's a nice

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.810 
eggs but once it's ready it's a nice
golden<00:03:31.120> color<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:35.190> got<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.280> cut<00:03:36.490> through<00:03:36.670> the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
golden color and got to cut through the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.449 
golden color and got to cut through the
vegetables<00:03:37.270> really<00:03:37.540> well<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:37.990> that<00:03:38.459> they

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
vegetables really well so that they

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.000 
vegetables really well so that they
don't<00:03:39.580> sort<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:40.000> slice<00:03:40.690> through<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
don't sort of slice through that the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.430 
don't sort of slice through that the
slice<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.430> quiche

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.600 

and<00:03:45.830> this<00:03:46.070> is<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.280> little<00:03:46.550> hot<00:03:46.880> for<00:03:46.910> slicing

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
and this is a little hot for slicing

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.710 
and this is a little hot for slicing
well<00:03:49.610> when<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.790> eat<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.030> really<00:03:50.330> hot<00:03:50.510> it's

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
well when you eat it really hot it's

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.630 
well when you eat it really hot it's
this<00:03:50.960> sort<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.530> really<00:03:52.280> great<00:03:54.220> really<00:03:55.220> smooth

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
this sort of really great really smooth

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.210 
this sort of really great really smooth
almost<00:03:55.940> putting<00:03:56.330> like<00:03:56.570> texture<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.380> if<00:03:58.100> you
