00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.740
 also my career choice 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.140
 I am still working for them 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.760
 with 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.250
 in cattle I always wanted 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.120
 look after people since I was very 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.990
 young I wanted to become a nurse gold 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.080
 when I finished my training 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.210
 secondary 1 ct 2000 which was very very 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.130
 quotas there was not much 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.140
 job opportunities so I got 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.369
 directed to another of the same then when 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.890
 I finished my training 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.300
 that was the homeaway group what we 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.740
 must ask a lot of nurses 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.500
 so I decided to 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.570
 to return to the branch you had me 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.820
 not preceded when I arrived at 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:50.000
 canada throw them a family too 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.560
 but here to become a mad nurse 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.020
 and that I make them the courses at 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.610
 complex it means any time but 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.420
 I have a little baby in my arms 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.970
 and then I 'm not going much money and 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.460
 friends believe that a year the classes 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.220
 together as being 2000 people 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.850
 who come from other pencil various 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.450
 formations and we often receive them 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.979
 updating the nurses 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.810
 auxiliaries who come from other countries 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.580
 and but the approach is very 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.950
 particular no but when I was on 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.070
 the migrants it was very difficult for 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.860
 me at the level because you speak 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.660
 Quebecois me I did not understand 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.300
 always then it's better weather for 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.060
 hands me I can integrate in the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.830
 classes the skills center 2000 it's 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.020
 a set a training center 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.979
 professional then we offer to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.700
 laval various formations whose 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.850
 health sector health education 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.960
 also aesthetic trade drawing 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.250
 industrial and automotive mechanics 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.770
 yesterday's nurse training is 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.369
 spread over four sessions, including 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.909
 first two 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.920
 these 900 hours 450 a week then 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.409
 it's mostly theory one 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.630
 internship per week and last two 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.849
 semesters sony that internships we have 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.790
 decided to set up an internship project 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.680
 human not because we wanted to see a 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.660
 little bit about health 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.519
 community have a vision more 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.580
 overall what it is in a 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.489
 community other than the ex me what 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.410
 you what we are currently living we are 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.880
 chose guatemala because they tell me 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.459
 thought it was still pretty 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.650
 different as context we said 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.480
 than the internship in another country 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.010
 respond is very much to his goals 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.810
 the mans ie to identify 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.380
 health needs inside a 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.239
 community 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.790
 we exchanged a lot with the staff 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.410
 there who could use any 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.720
 their training stage all courses 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.599
 that they had close to ba of the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.400
 health their vision of health care and 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.170
 it was very profitable for our elders I 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.720
 think about transposing my experience that I have 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.739
 lived in guatemala transpose it 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.750
 here in Quebec by bringing a more 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.650
 human in school care on 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.709
 do not apprehend everything 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.109
 it's always the experiences that 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.230
 gives you it's always because even 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.410
 ok I learned how it works and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.630
 if I 'm going to change my child you have to 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.639
 that I apply them all because the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.410
 documentations always different 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.600
 the papers are different even the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.420
 devices are indifferent even though I have 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.130
 called to the star but still we 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.160
 learn from the base we learn from 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.859
 principle a plus one fits on a wire 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.359
 according to the establishment the work of 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.849
 auxiliary nurses consists of 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.920
 give assistance care to the 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.720
 clientele doing dressings give 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.299
 injections administered the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.000
 medication and work with 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.560
 high level nurses 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.520
 of the care plan it is sure that the woman 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.010
 is resilient does not give the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.690
 intravenous drugs everything 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.460
 which concerns solutes 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.260
 the nurse the nurse has to ask a 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.520
 nursing diagnosis according to the law and 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.880
 for the nursing assistant 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.810
 so they are a valuable support 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.000
 developing care with the 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.709
 clientele I am responsible for everything and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.530
 I am 36 exciting where my day 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.260
 starts with medication distribution 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.900
 who I do insulins since I have 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.940
 do the plasmas then it's ours 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.280
 folder start I started six hours 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.019
 from morning to 14 years old I finish and what 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.700
 passionate the most in my work it's 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.070
 to be able to provide support from 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.990
 quÃ©bec is lagging behind in the past 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.330
 to reinforce them by teaching him 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.030
 good things to do then to see that 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.510
 the person understands grown up and evolved 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.270
 then comes out of the hospital in good health 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.850
 which pleases energy qualities 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.030
 required for the profession ability 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.430
 adaptive ability to listen to a big 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.770
 sense of dedication to be able 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.630
 to analyze a situation that is born 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.510
 as it takes a good good happiness 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.410
 judgment of having an ability in 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.330
 sciences because we need to make 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.380
 calculations one is useful anatomy the 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.400
 physiology then 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.200
 it requires an intellectual capacity 1 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.960
 it's big it's an area where is this 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.220
 that technology changes everything changes to 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.210
 every day so you have to be very 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.880
 curious to have a lot of spirit of equipped 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.440
 work the docks the first thing 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.980
 this is wrong and only what you 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.580
 do it is always otherwise your 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.320
 day would not end and you have to have 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.170
 a lot of patience and especially 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.350
 with the elderly because the 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:41.380
 characters and it's like children 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.940
 then you have to work too but 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.620
 especially what I always said it takes 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.330
 have a big because right now the 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.630
 manpower requirements for 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.910
 auxiliary nurses are huge 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.180
 they all have a job after their 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.650
 training they even their last internship 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.670
 they do it in the centers 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.080
 hospital and he hires them on site 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.590
 and these women heroes of yesterday can 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.450
 work primarily in the network of 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.860
 health in Quebec, that is, in the 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.870
 short-term hospitals 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.350
 in the allied care paths of 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.130
 long duration 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.449
 they can also worked in the private 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.370
 for the future 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.169
 after I do not know I will work 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.830
 a lot in my field 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.860
 I think the rest is named for up to 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.710
 the end until I retired I am very 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.289
 well who I work here five days 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.229
 full time week I 'm okay 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.689
 presently but for sure one day 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.370
 maybe continue my studies doing 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:42.779
 something more human I'm not 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.779
 a conditioning in what
