a<00:03:20.100> bit<00:03:20.340> unprofessional<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.740> just<00:03:22.740> don't<00:03:23.250> have

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
a bit unprofessional I just don't have

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.960 
a bit unprofessional I just don't have
my<00:03:23.610> bar<00:03:23.850> set<00:03:24.210> up<00:03:24.240> down<00:03:24.630> there<00:03:25.310> let's<00:03:26.310> go<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:26.640> to

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
my bar set up down there let's go get to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.600 
my bar set up down there let's go get to
is<00:03:27.180> because<00:03:27.810> I'm<00:03:27.990> going<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.230> have<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.440> use<00:03:28.680> one

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.570 

time<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.640> picked<00:03:32.820> up<00:03:33.000> two<00:03:33.180> but<00:03:33.390> okay<00:03:34.580> seeing

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
time I picked up two but okay seeing

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:46.510 
time I picked up two but okay seeing
them<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.180> there<00:03:37.340> Beth<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.580> there<00:03:40.250> well

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.340 

there's<00:03:47.520> probably<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.180> way<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.450> do<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:48.990> with

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
there's probably a way to do this with

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.660 
there's probably a way to do this with
any<00:03:49.680> thing<00:03:50.490> in<00:03:50.640> your<00:03:50.790> inventory<00:03:52.130> what<00:03:53.130> all<00:03:53.610> of

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
any thing in your inventory what all of

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.320 
any thing in your inventory what all of
those<00:03:54.120> my<00:03:54.360> binoculars<00:03:55.430> refer<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.490> but

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
those my binoculars refer to but

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.730 
those my binoculars refer to but
personally<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.350> using<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.830> secondary

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
personally I like using a secondary

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.550 
personally I like using a secondary
because<00:04:01.740> if<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.120> have<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> good<00:04:03.630> primary<00:04:04.140> you

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
because if you have a good primary you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.170 
because if you have a good primary you
don't<00:04:04.740> really<00:04:04.920> need<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.190> secondary<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:06.030> can

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
don't really need a secondary you can

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.110 
don't really need a secondary you can
just<00:04:06.390> use<00:04:06.570> your<00:04:06.600> Sabre<00:04:07.020> for<00:04:07.380> zombies<00:04:08.120> any

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
just use your Sabre for zombies any

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.750 
just use your Sabre for zombies any
pistol<00:04:09.930> will<00:04:10.050> work<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:11.220> just<00:04:11.430> got<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.700> know

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
pistol will work you just got to know

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.920 
pistol will work you just got to know
the<00:04:11.970> code<00:04:12.770> all<00:04:13.770> right<00:04:13.890> now<00:04:14.570> let's<00:04:15.570> get<00:04:15.750> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
the code all right now let's get a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.740 
the code all right now let's get a
little<00:04:16.230> bit<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.440> here<00:04:17.359> we'll<00:04:18.359> want<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
little bit in here we'll want to do a

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.250 
little bit in here we'll want to do a
new<00:04:18.989> scan<00:04:19.320> set<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.890> value<00:04:20.220> top<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.609> 4<00:04:21.260> then

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
new scan set the value top to 4 then

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.680 
new scan set the value top to 4 then
we'll<00:04:22.440> go<00:04:22.530> look<00:04:22.770> up<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.220> code<00:04:23.850> for<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.390> model

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
we'll go look up the code for the model

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.650 
we'll go look up the code for the model
625<00:04:25.500> which<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.980> gun<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.160> picked<00:04:26.430> up<00:04:26.660> it's

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
625 which is the gun I picked up it's

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:39.650 
625 which is the gun I picked up it's
right<00:04:27.780> there<00:04:37.910> go<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:38.970> your<00:04:39.030> inventory<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
right there go to your inventory and

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.440 
right there go to your inventory and
drop<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:40.560> or<00:04:40.890> store<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.430> doesn't<00:04:41.820> matter<00:04:41.940> as

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
drop it or store it doesn't matter as

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.670 
drop it or store it doesn't matter as
long<00:04:42.540> as<00:04:42.690> it's<00:04:42.810> out<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:42.960> your<00:04:43.050> inventory<00:04:43.260> there

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
long as it's out of your inventory there

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.530 
long as it's out of your inventory there
should<00:04:43.830> be<00:04:43.919> two<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.100> them<00:04:44.310> double<00:04:45.270> click<00:04:45.419> them

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
should be two of them double click them

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.490 
should be two of them double click them
both<00:04:45.950> go<00:04:46.950> pick<00:04:47.280> up<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.490> gun<00:04:47.610> again<00:04:48.350> they<00:04:49.350> can

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
both go pick up the gun again they can

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.560 
both go pick up the gun again they can
both<00:04:49.650> active<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.280> personally<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.000> like<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.240> try

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
both active and personally I like to try

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.800 
both active and personally I like to try
and<00:04:51.600> see<00:04:52.010> which<00:04:53.010> one<00:04:53.340> is<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:54.660> right<00:04:54.900> one<00:04:56.810> okay

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
and see which one is the right one okay

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.310 
and see which one is the right one okay
so<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:58.169> see<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.440> top<00:04:58.620> one<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:59.630> then<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:01.110> just

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
so you see the top one is then you just

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.750 
so you see the top one is then you just
got<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:02.150> top<00:05:03.150> in<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.690> codes<00:05:04.250> for<00:05:05.250> whatever<00:05:05.640> you

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
got to top in the codes for whatever you

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.050 
got to top in the codes for whatever you
want<00:05:05.970> see<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:06.510> already<00:05:06.690> have<00:05:06.960> an<00:05:07.080> MRE<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:07.620> waters

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
want see I already have an MRE in waters

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.390 
want see I already have an MRE in waters
codes<00:05:09.060> memorized<00:05:09.919> but<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:11.040> can<00:05:11.190> spawn
