community who read this and we're
talking<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:40.050> how<00:00:40.290> much<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.620> enjoyed<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
talking about how much they enjoyed it I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.460 
talking about how much they enjoyed it I
have<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> liked<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.630> didn't<00:00:42.990> love

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
have to say I liked it but I didn't love

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.200 
have to say I liked it but I didn't love
it<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.770> way<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.130> was<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.580> of<00:00:44.640> hoping<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it the way that I was kind of hoping to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
it the way that I was kind of hoping to
I<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:45.720> part<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.080> the<00:00:46.170> reason<00:00:46.200> why<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
I think part of the reason why is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.100 
I think part of the reason why is
because<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.460> book<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:48.090> weirdly<00:00:48.570> talked

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
because this book was weirdly talked

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.830 
because this book was weirdly talked
about<00:00:49.470> or<00:00:49.740> by<00:00:50.190> weirdly<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> mean<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.720> way

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
about or by weirdly I mean the way

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.300 
about or by weirdly I mean the way
people<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.200> talking<00:00:52.560> about<00:00:52.650> this<00:00:52.920> book<00:00:53.130> I

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
people are talking about this book I

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
short I believe this is less than 300

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.960 
short I believe this is less than 300
pages<00:02:49.709> yeah<00:02:50.709> it's<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.069> just<00:02:51.340> under<00:02:51.579> 300

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
pages yeah it's like just under 300

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.050 
pages yeah it's like just under 300
pages<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.450> 290<00:02:53.140> pages<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.829> so<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> story

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
pages like 290 pages and so with a story

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.759 
pages like 290 pages and so with a story
this<00:02:55.360> short<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.140> you're<00:02:56.260> following<00:02:56.410> around

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
this short and you're following around

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.440 
this short and you're following around
multiple<00:02:57.160> perspectives<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:57.940> even<00:02:58.239> less

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
multiple perspectives you get even less

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.850 
multiple perspectives you get even less
time<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.079> might<00:02:59.230> with<00:02:59.500> some<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.799> the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
time that you might with some of the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.009 
time that you might with some of the
other<00:03:00.040> books<00:03:00.549> I've<00:03:00.760> read<00:03:01.090> where<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.780> books

are like 500 pages and there's multiple
perspectives<00:03:04.269> at<00:03:04.720> least<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.349> to

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
perspectives at least then you get to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.960 
perspectives at least then you get to
dig<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.709> little<00:03:05.890> bit<00:03:06.010> deeper<00:03:06.129> but<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.549> feel<00:03:06.730> like

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
dig a little bit deeper but I feel like

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.600 
dig a little bit deeper but I feel like
outside<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.840> save<00:03:08.290> maybe<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.769> mom<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.430> don't

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
characters which is not something I

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.960

enjoy because my favorite part about any

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.640 
enjoy because my favorite part about any
story<00:03:16.299> is<00:03:16.540> getting<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.959> know<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.200> characters

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
story is getting to know the characters

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.440 
story is getting to know the characters
like<00:03:18.190> my<00:03:18.310> biggest<00:03:18.519> grape<00:03:18.910> but<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.239> book<00:03:19.420> is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
like my biggest grape but this book is

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.809 
like my biggest grape but this book is
that<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.989> wish<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.560> was<00:03:20.650> either<00:03:20.799> longer<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.609> wish

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
that I wish it was either longer I wish

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.160 
that I wish it was either longer I wish
it<00:03:21.970> was<00:03:22.060> just<00:03:22.090> hold<00:03:22.480> from<00:03:22.690> like<00:03:22.900> one

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
it was just hold from like one

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.449 
it was just hold from like one
characters<00:03:23.620> perspective

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
characters perspective

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.190 
characters perspective
honestly<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.000> wanted<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.630> just<00:03:25.810> keep<00:03:25.959> reading

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
honestly I wanted to just keep reading

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.740 
honestly I wanted to just keep reading
about<00:03:26.440> Lydia<00:03:26.709> most<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.430> time<00:03:27.670> because<00:03:28.420> her

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
about Lydia most of the time because her

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.470 
about Lydia most of the time because her
life<00:03:29.079> well<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> wouldn't<00:03:29.889> say<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.280> was<00:03:30.340> good<00:03:31.209> I

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
life well I wouldn't say it was good I

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.879 
life well I wouldn't say it was good I
would<00:03:31.720> say<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:31.959> was<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.170> most<00:03:32.349> interesting<00:03:32.650> to

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
would say it was the most interesting to

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.069 
would say it was the most interesting to
me<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.370> think<00:03:33.760> Lydia<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.299> Marilyn<00:03:34.690> probably

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
me I think Lydia and Marilyn probably

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.710 
me I think Lydia and Marilyn probably
had<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.680> most<00:03:35.709> developed<00:03:36.310> stories<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.420> this

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
had the most developed stories in this

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.140 
had the most developed stories in this
book<00:03:38.440> which<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:38.799> might<00:03:39.130> be<00:03:39.160> why<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.459> was<00:03:39.849> most

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
book which is might be why I was most

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.059 
book which is might be why I was most
drawn<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.510> them<00:03:40.870> but<00:03:41.200> if<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.500> story<00:03:41.739> was<00:03:41.889> told

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
drawn to them but if the story was told

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.470 
drawn to them but if the story was told
from<00:03:42.370> either<00:03:42.519> of<00:03:42.639> their<00:03:42.819> perspectives<00:03:43.329> but

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
from either of their perspectives but

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.120 
from either of their perspectives but
preferably<00:03:43.840> Lydia<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.560> probably<00:03:44.799> would<00:03:45.040> have

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
preferably Lydia I probably would have

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.280 
preferably Lydia I probably would have
enjoyed<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.669> like<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.880> million<00:03:46.450> times<00:03:46.660> more

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
enjoyed this like a million times more

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.740 
enjoyed this like a million times more
I<00:03:47.319> feel<00:03:47.650> like<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:48.040> story<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.639> like<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:49.090> start

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
I feel like this story is like the start

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750 
I feel like this story is like the start
of<00:03:50.049> something<00:03:50.109> really<00:03:50.829> good<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.549> had

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
of something really good and had

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.789 
of something really good and had
potential<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.329> go<00:03:52.630> even<00:03:52.840> farther<00:03:53.169> and<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.590> just

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
potential to go even farther and it just

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.500 
potential to go even farther and it just
didn't<00:03:54.130> go<00:03:54.190> far<00:03:54.340> enough<00:03:54.849> for<00:03:55.090> me<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.359> that's

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
didn't go far enough for me and that's

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.479 
didn't go far enough for me and that's
why<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:56.019> was<00:03:56.319> left<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.680> little<00:03:56.799> bit<00:03:56.980> disappointed

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
why I was left a little bit disappointed

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.129 
why I was left a little bit disappointed
that<00:03:57.639> being<00:03:58.000> said<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.239> didn't<00:03:58.690> hate<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:58.959> book

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
that being said I didn't hate this book

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.809 
that being said I didn't hate this book
whatsoever<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.889> gave<00:04:00.099> it<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.280> 3<00:04:00.310> out<00:04:00.549> of<00:04:00.579> 5<00:04:00.669> stars

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
whatsoever I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.330 
whatsoever I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars
look<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.419> liked<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.230> didn't<00:04:02.650> love<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:03.250> I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
look I liked it I didn't love it and I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.890 
look I liked it I didn't love it and I
think<00:04:03.370> part<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.120> might<00:04:04.299> have<00:04:04.329> just<00:04:04.720> had

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
think part of that might have just had

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.289 
think part of that might have just had
to<00:04:05.049> do<00:04:05.169> with<00:04:05.380> like<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.620> hype<00:04:05.859> machine<00:04:06.069> or<00:04:06.579> just

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
to do with like the hype machine or just

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.809 
to do with like the hype machine or just
add<00:04:07.480> marketing<00:04:08.169> for<00:04:08.680> me<00:04:08.859> I<00:04:09.160> feel<00:04:09.400> like<00:04:09.459> if<00:04:09.669> I'd

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
add marketing for me I feel like if I'd

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.339 
add marketing for me I feel like if I'd
known<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.150> little<00:04:10.480> bit<00:04:10.569> better<00:04:10.690> what<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.109> story

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
known a little bit better what the story

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.690 
known a little bit better what the story
was<00:04:11.470> about<00:04:11.680> going<00:04:11.829> into<00:04:12.099> it<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.400> could<00:04:12.669> have

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
was about going into it I could have

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.940 
was about going into it I could have
managed<00:04:13.269> my<00:04:13.419> expectations<00:04:14.169> better<00:04:14.349> and<00:04:14.739> I

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
managed my expectations better and I

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.520 
managed my expectations better and I
feel<00:04:14.980> bad<00:04:15.340> faulting<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:16.180> book<00:04:16.539> for<00:04:16.989> my<00:04:17.320> own

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
feel bad faulting a book for my own

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.650 
feel bad faulting a book for my own
expectations<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:19.000> that's<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.630> way

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
expectations but that's just the way

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.959 
expectations but that's just the way
that<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.019> felt<00:04:20.260> but<00:04:20.620> at<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.859> end<00:04:21.010> of<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.310> so<00:04:21.640> it's

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
that I felt but at the end of it so it's

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.089 
that I felt but at the end of it so it's
hard<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.270> give<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.140> higher<00:04:23.349> rating<00:04:23.770> if<00:04:24.010> I

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
hard to give it a higher rating if I

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.200 
hard to give it a higher rating if I
didn't<00:04:24.370> feel

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
didn't feel

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.550 
didn't feel
way<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.479> I<00:04:25.539> feel<00:04:25.750> when<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:26.020> normally<00:04:26.440> get

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
way that I feel when I normally get

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.350 
way that I feel when I normally get
booked<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.889> higher<00:04:27.039> rating<00:04:27.340> there<00:04:27.940> are<00:04:28.120> other

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
booked a higher rating there are other

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.270 
booked a higher rating there are other
aspects<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.050> book<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.289> I<00:04:29.680> could<00:04:30.009> easily

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
aspects of this book that I could easily

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.400 
aspects of this book that I could easily
talk<00:04:30.639> about<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.270> title<00:04:31.600> comes<00:04:31.870> from<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.199> fact

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
talk about the title comes from the fact

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.920 
talk about the title comes from the fact
that<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:33.310> characters<00:04:33.759> are<00:04:34.150> really<00:04:34.569> bad<00:04:34.750> at

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
that the characters are really bad at

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.570 
that the characters are really bad at
communicating<00:04:35.440> with<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.979> other<00:04:36.099> characters

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
communicating with the other characters

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.860 
communicating with the other characters
in<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.849> book<00:04:37.060> so<00:04:37.240> there's<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.509> lot<00:04:37.840> of

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
in this book so there's a lot of

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.659 
in this book so there's a lot of
situations<00:04:38.560> where<00:04:38.800> they<00:04:39.099> could<00:04:39.340> have<00:04:39.430> just

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
situations where they could have just

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.550 
situations where they could have just

been solved by just communicating better

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.010 
been solved by just communicating better
by<00:04:42.190> being<00:04:42.340> open<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:43.120> honest<00:04:43.449> and<00:04:43.720> just

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
by being open and honest and just

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.629 
by being open and honest and just
talking<00:04:44.349> about<00:04:44.440> their<00:04:44.680> feelings<00:04:45.069> all<00:04:45.310> the

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
talking about their feelings all the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.330 
talking about their feelings all the
characters<00:04:45.970> in<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.210> book<00:04:46.300> seem<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.990> just

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
characters in this book seem to just

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.469 
characters in this book seem to just
internalize<00:04:48.340> everything<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:49.090> not<00:04:49.180> really

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
internalize everything and not really

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.020 
internalize everything and not really
talk<00:04:49.660> about<00:04:49.690> their<00:04:50.020> feelings<00:04:50.470> which<00:04:51.039> causes<00:04:51.940> a

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
talk about their feelings which causes a

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.879 
talk about their feelings which causes a
lot<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.240> anxiety<00:04:52.479> on<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.020> reader<00:04:53.349> but<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.650> think

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
lot of anxiety on the reader but I think

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.680 
lot of anxiety on the reader but I think
it's<00:04:54.009> purposeful<00:04:54.520> but<00:04:54.849> I<00:04:54.940> do<00:04:55.030> know<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.389> that

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
it's purposeful but I do know that that

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.420 
it's purposeful but I do know that that
might<00:04:55.900> be<00:04:56.020> frustrating<00:04:56.590> for<00:04:56.620> some<00:04:56.860> people<00:04:57.160> and

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
might be frustrating for some people and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.710 
might be frustrating for some people and
so<00:04:57.550> some<00:04:57.759> people<00:04:57.849> might<00:04:58.120> not<00:04:58.240> like<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.570> book

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
so some people might not like the book

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.300 
so some people might not like the book
for<00:04:58.870> that<00:04:58.930> so<00:04:59.470> yeah<00:04:59.590> those<00:04:59.860> are<00:04:59.919> my<00:05:00.280> quick
