00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.100
 welcome to this switch tutorial 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.230
 max in which we will learn to create a 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.450
 simple animation of a car in 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.880
 trajectory as we observe in the 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.170
 screen follows all my activities to 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.170
 through my fan page on facebook 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.630
 dotcom diagonal creative graphics 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.670
 click the button I like and follow me 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.050
 before starting, I told you that switch 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.320
 mac is a program to create 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.519
 animations like adobe flash 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.230
 originally this program comes in 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.320
 English but with the help of a translator 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.060
 has been found in Spanish for 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.220
 More details about the program 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.320
 I will leave the links below this video 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.250
 once we have opened our 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.350
 Program 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.690
 we're going to file again we're going to 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.790
 look like a scene like it is here in the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.540
 option of film in width we place 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 500 height 300 and in speed of 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.670
 frame 29 frames per second 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.160
 we have our scene like that inside the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.210
 pack comes a file called vectors 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.700
 of pneumatic and road cars as well as 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.890
 we are observing on the screen is a 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.210
 file that can be opened with coreldraw 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.970
 here we will find three elements 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.380
 a car and a tire we are going to 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.110
 select the road only 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 giving click we are going to copy edition 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.560
 we think so max menu edit paste 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.930
 graphic we mark the first box that 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.780
 says to combine imported objects in a 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.960
 form and click on import we will place 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.200
 very good our image so on this side 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.810
 since we are going to slide it from the center to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.700
 our left we are going to hide this 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.920
 image by clicking on this small 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.860
 icon with the help of the tool 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.410
 rule let's create some guides like that on 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.470
 around the white box that is the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.649
 scene one here and also another one 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.649
 here below we make visible again the 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.940
 image let's decrease the zoom 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.950
 approximately 33 percent 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.050
 we select this tool that is 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.840
 called animation path we make a 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.459
 click here to the center of the image and let's go 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.519
 to drag towards on our side 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.650
 left in this way so more or less 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.210
 here we can see that it has appeared 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.240
 a line of color 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.030
 and here in this part above that is the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.430
 timeline activates an effect which 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.410
 it's called moving if we move the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.290
 head to zero we can see that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.690
 automatically the image slips from 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.910
 side to side here where it says shape 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.700
 we click and place it as 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.850
 road name to be able to identify 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.280
 well our images we place 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.890
 completely the head to zero done 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.140
 this click on this icon to increase the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.150
 zoom one hundred percent we go back 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.180
 again to coreldraw we selected 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.090
 this car in the same way edition copy 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.120
 we go back to their macs we 're going to edition 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.820
 paste graph in the same way click on 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.770
 combine objects import we have 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.920
 our car around here with the tool 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.080
 to move we are going to place our 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.780
 auto so we go back to 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.220
 Coreldraw we select the wheel edition 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.700
 copy we return edit paste chart 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.800
 import and there we have our tire 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.580
 let's increase the zoom by pressing 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.720
 control 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.420
 plus the sum key in this way to 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.980
 better observe our scene 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.160
 we select this auto here we go 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.380
 to name auto we select this 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.190
 shape and we will put wheel 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.340
 we press control r to trim the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.460
 object and disappear we go to the menu 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.010
 insert select spread this us 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.830
 is going to help you to repeat over and over 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.990
 time the image that we are going to animate with 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.920
 the inserted script we press control 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.040
 v 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.900
 once I checked uve twice here 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
 we can see that within the spread 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.510
 there are two wheels we are going to select one 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.150
 with this tool to rotate we are going to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.910
 move the image a few degrees doing 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.480
 click on this little circle and we rotate 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.510
 in this way so only here you 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 let's put wheel one and we're going to 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.870
 put wheel 2 to change the names 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.180
 you only make a sustained click on 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.740
 the text here where it says wheel 1 in the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.840
 timeline let's give button 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.930
 right appears 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.870
 and then appear we're going to put you as 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.400
 time only one frame 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.220
 we select wheel 2 and up here 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.840
 after the first frame we're going to 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.990
 put the same effect right button 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.020
 appear and appear again reduce 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.419
 to a frame the wheel 2 and we press 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.520
 here where it says play to play 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.680
 the movie and there we can see that 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.590
 the image of the wheel is moving 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.510
 let's stop the animation we close the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.699
 sprint and here we are going to put it as a 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.800
 man rolls here on the timeline 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.169
 we will not see the effect of the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.750
 wheel since this is inside for 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.360
 watch it nothing else active the sprint 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.250
 by clicking on this little icon and 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.380
 we can automatically see the effect 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.690
 what's inside for each of the 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.020
 wheels close we appear in the scene 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.120
 original scene 1 we select the wheel 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.880
 we are going to place it here we press 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.669
 control is controlled to paste and 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.850
 duplicate those wheels at the same time 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.580
 We spread the spread and its effects by 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.370
 here we are going to zoom out a bit 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.800
 this way here we have it I'm going to 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.189
 press play and automatically 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.009
 we can see how the road is encouraged 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:46.139
 the tires and gives the feeling that the 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.300
 auto is moving in trajectory 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:52.259
 let's stop the animation we press 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.539
 t control to open the animation in a 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.909
 player and here we can observe 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.219
 better still this way we will stay 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.469
 our animation is going to repeat one and 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:04.080
 again because all the 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:06.270
 animations are repeated automatically to 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.060
 unless a command is applied to 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.490
 stop to stop the scene let's 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.520
 close here to finish we're going to 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.159
 export file we select where 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.000
 says projector here we're going to put you by 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.800
 example auto animation we click on 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.960
 in saving our 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.229
 animation we go to the folder where 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.759
 we have saved here what we have I am going to 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.159
 Double click here to open the 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:33.629
 animation and here we can observe the 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.669
 Of course, it will not be possible 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:38.310
 appreciate it well since I'm recording the 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.770
 screen but I'll leave the link 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.810
 this multimedia file so that what 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.780
 can download and appreciate in 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.670
 correctly the animation correctly 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.650
 the materials are on my site 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.100
 web through the link below this 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.230
 video 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.290
 it's that easy to create an animation 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.030
 basic and simple switch max follow 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.430
 all the steps correctly and they 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.530
 it will stay the same as I hope there will be 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.000
 liked and be useful see you in 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.000
