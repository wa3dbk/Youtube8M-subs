00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
we're working on one white alleble so I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.400 
we're working on one white alleble so I
got<00:00:21.240> three<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> them<00:00:21.539> put<00:00:21.810> together<00:00:21.930> i'm<00:00:22.260> going

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
got three of them put together i'm going

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.779 
got three of them put together i'm going
to<00:00:22.470> put<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> button<00:00:22.890> here<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.310> illustrate<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to put a button here just illustrate a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.259 
to put a button here just illustrate a
single<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:25.099> like<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.369> swaps<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> blue

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
single one like so so swaps the blue

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.300 
single one like so so swaps the blue
with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.750> wide<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.439> swap<00:00:28.920> those<00:00:29.099> with

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
with the wide you can swap those with

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.600 
with the wide you can swap those with
whatever<00:00:29.519> once<00:00:31.070> you're<00:00:32.070> able<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.489> basically

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
whatever once you're able to basically

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.700 
whatever once you're able to basically
put<00:00:33.030> them<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.300> together<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.140> your<00:00:34.320> input

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
put them all together this is your input

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
put them all together this is your input
block<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.219> these<00:00:35.520> blocks<00:00:35.940> holding<00:00:36.360> these

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
block so these blocks holding these

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
block so these blocks holding these
torches<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.110> where<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> power<00:00:37.590> goes<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.040> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
torches are where the power goes in so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.010 
torches are where the power goes in so
for<00:00:38.760> example<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> power<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.870> into

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
for example I have the power going into

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.540 
for example I have the power going into
those<00:00:40.260> blocks<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:40.920> repeaters<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
those blocks with these repeaters and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.150 
those blocks with these repeaters and
let's<00:00:42.480> give<00:00:42.629> us<00:00:42.750> ourselves<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
let's give us ourselves a little bit of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.410 
let's give us ourselves a little bit of
room<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.520> they<00:00:44.610> know<00:00:44.760> we'll<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.180> three

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
of them going let's get some redstone

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.040 
of them going let's get some redstone
it's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.440> wiring<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.309> go

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
it's a little bit of wiring there we go

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
it's a little bit of wiring there we go
there<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:55.430> everything<00:00:56.430> alright

these<00:01:08.820> let's<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.689> repeater<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.950> three

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
these let's put a repeater here on three

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.090 
these let's put a repeater here on three
tix<00:01:12.150> let's<00:01:12.420> put<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.840> sticky<00:01:13.320> piston<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.860> so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
tix let's put a sticky piston like so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.179 
tix let's put a sticky piston like so
and<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.820> redstone<00:01:15.180> block<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:17.100> here

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and a redstone block like so from here

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.280 
and a redstone block like so from here
we're<00:01:17.460> gonna<00:01:17.520> put<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> redstone<00:01:18.119> torch<00:01:18.540> shut<00:01:19.140> up

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
we're gonna put a redstone torch shut up

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
we're gonna put a redstone torch shut up
phone<00:01:19.590> block<00:01:20.100> their<00:01:20.430> redstone<00:01:21.060> torch<00:01:21.390> here

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
phone block their redstone torch here

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
from here on we're gonna go one repeater

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.940 
from here on we're gonna go one repeater
what<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:28.110> ticks<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.829> then

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
what is that two ticks on this one then

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.630 
what is that two ticks on this one then
let's<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.640> up<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.280> sticky<00:01:32.280> piston

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
let's go up like so and sticky piston

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
let's go up like so and sticky piston
facing<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:33.270> sticky<00:01:33.659> piston<00:01:34.020> facing

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
facing down sticky piston facing

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.890 
facing down sticky piston facing
outwards<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.180> let's<00:01:36.450> put<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> block

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
outwards like so and let's put the block

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.039 
outwards like so and let's put the block
that's<00:01:37.079> gonna<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.590> exposed<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.869> is

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that's gonna be exposed like so this is

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.889 
that's gonna be exposed like so this is
the<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.439> gonna<00:01:40.650> swap<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.630> mean<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the one that's gonna swap I mean if you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
the one that's gonna swap I mean if you
mess<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.439> portion<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.159> flip-flop<00:01:44.700> up

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
mess this portion up just flip-flop up

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
mess this portion up just flip-flop up
guys<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.450> nothing<00:01:45.750> no<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.140> deal<00:01:46.350> alright

guys it's nothing no big deal alright
and<00:01:47.280> let's<00:01:47.310> set<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> wall<00:01:48.229> basically

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and let's set up the wall basically

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.889 
and let's set up the wall basically
what's<00:01:49.380> gonna<00:01:49.530> kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.890> flesh<00:01:50.689> like<00:01:51.689> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
what's gonna kind of be flesh like that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
what's gonna kind of be flesh like that
so<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.259> some<00:01:52.470> kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.740> guiding<00:01:53.520> going

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
so we have some kind of guiding going

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.200 
so we have some kind of guiding going
for<00:01:54.149> us

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
for us

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
alright so there we go this one is the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.060 
alright so there we go this one is the
one<00:01:58.690> that's<00:01:58.840> going<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:59.020> swap<00:01:59.260> out<00:01:59.470> all<00:01:59.680> right

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
one that's going to swap out all right

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.510 
one that's going to swap out all right
and<00:02:00.510> redstone<00:02:01.510> block<00:02:01.960> right<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:03.010> a

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and redstone block right here and a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.670 
and redstone block right here and a
block<00:02:04.150> to<00:02:04.180> push<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.840> could<00:02:04.960> be<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> white<00:02:05.380> block

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
block to push it could be a white block

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.020 
block to push it could be a white block
it<00:02:05.830> could<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.040> any<00:02:06.159> block<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:06.580> block<00:02:06.760> doesn't

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
it could be any block this block doesn't

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.090 
it could be any block this block doesn't
do<00:02:07.330> anything<00:02:07.659> but<00:02:07.810> basically<00:02:08.500> assist<00:02:08.920> in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
do anything but basically assist in

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.980 
do anything but basically assist in
pushing<00:02:09.369> stuff<00:02:09.759> okay<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.119> keep<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.569> in<00:02:10.720> mind

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
pushing stuff okay so keep that in mind

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.260 
pushing stuff okay so keep that in mind
and<00:02:11.230> then<00:02:11.920> sticky<00:02:12.310> piston<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.760> would<00:02:12.910> say<00:02:13.060> put

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
and then sticky piston I would say put

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.449 
and then sticky piston I would say put
this<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.680> very<00:02:14.709> end<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.220> everything

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
this one at the very end of everything

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.699 
this one at the very end of everything
okay<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.209> then<00:02:16.810> that's<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.170> basically<00:02:17.380> this

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
okay and then that's it basically this

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.199 
okay and then that's it basically this
is<00:02:17.830> our<00:02:17.980> input<00:02:18.130> block<00:02:18.520> right<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:18.730> again<00:02:19.090> so

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
is our input block right here again so

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.210 
is our input block right here again so
we're<00:02:19.300> going<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> use<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.600> button<00:02:20.100> going<00:02:21.100> to

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
we're going to use a button going to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.949 
we're going to use a button going to
stop<00:02:21.459> off<00:02:21.670> between<00:02:21.910> those<00:02:22.209> two<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.720> doesn't

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
stop off between those two it doesn't

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.710 
stop off between those two it doesn't
have<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.260> be<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:24.160> solid<00:02:24.819> block<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.569> use<00:02:25.690> a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
have to be a solid block you can use a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.810 
have to be a solid block you can use a
transparent<00:02:26.110> block<00:02:26.680> if<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.190> choose<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.670> do

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
transparent block if you so choose to do

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.610 
transparent block if you so choose to do
so<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.870> case<00:02:29.050> we're<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.410> swap

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
so so in this case we're going to swap

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.320 
so so in this case we're going to swap
it<00:02:29.769> out<00:02:29.830> with<00:02:29.890> some<00:02:30.130> glowstone<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:33.330> like

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
it out with some glowstone like so like

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.170 
it out with some glowstone like so like
so<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.800> again<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.550> want<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.820> do<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> bunch
