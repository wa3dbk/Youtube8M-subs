00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.490
 good to finish the assembly and 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.120
 We're going to put the tape 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.789
 dan ta so that she does not go there she comes 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.190
 with an adhesive underneath you will 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.870
 put and the mother is you get by 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:25.870
 here it is and tomorrow it is and walking 6 times 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:30.820
 Yeah but before you remember to pull the 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:36.880
 row of the table command pick up 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:39.310
 down and then we take the tape that 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.170
 start here you leave a ball 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.170
 you will take a walk 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.030
 it's just a straight turn you leave one 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.010
 Little nibble here that's what's going to come 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.590
 here inside the cross has a good 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.790
 here he goes inside you 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.640
 begins with addressing the era is the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.640
 maximum that gives the example here in the hand 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:22.659
 leaves leftover after neither pulling 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.659
 nor the thickness of the tape to see it is 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.990
 You have to pull it here. 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:36.979
 She's kind of paying attention to stay. 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.770
 juscias aquino announced in charge you 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.219
 make a come back and if it ended right here 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.079
 you do more one days leading inside 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.810
 but taking it 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.140
 pulls rubber also take over 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:58.879
 take a little interest in the basic 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:02.479
 Commando , you 're going up there, right? 

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:05.569
 and then it will pick up the plastic above the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.780
 command yet another very fair turn 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.780
 on here 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 It's good to be always very tight here. 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:23.170
 because it is where it continues with 6 thickness 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.480
 here at the end you end with a 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.650
 Extra tape because you can not trust 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.079
 much of the color of the ribbon that passed the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:46.190
 handlebar color is a guaranteed one 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:51.739
 that he will not come back to finish 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.019
 You'll put the lid here to do it. 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.019
 with that what's left to stay 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.080
 in there
