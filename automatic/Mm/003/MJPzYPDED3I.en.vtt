00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.820
 if we mean by secularity not only 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.890
 a report of the state with religion 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 but the question of state report 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
 with authority in general its 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.750
 designation his criticism we see that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.560
 the school and this essential crossroads 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.480
 yes implementation criticism 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.940
 necessary of all authority and all 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.730
 dogma be it political religious 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.190
 economic 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.390
 they say that school is in crisis are 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.879
 credited she is only the room 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.809
 echo of a crisis that surrounded him 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.870
 exceeds since his invention of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.920
 quotation marks in 1789 and especially since the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.970
 development of its cruise regime 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 since 1880 French school has 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.309
 globally assume two tons the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.409
 transmission of knowledge and training 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.280
 an identity 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.970
 in other words a mission 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.500
 pedagogical and a political mission 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.799
 the second under the cover 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.440
 from the first as well far from being 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.110
 a technical institution in the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.399
 theory would be the pedagogy intended to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 put rising generations into 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.220
 possession of knowledge and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.010
 skills 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.380
 intended to integrate into existence 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.090
 this school is on the contrary a 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.970
 political ideological institution of 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.360
 identity formation here are chizÃ© in 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.030
 class who use the transmission 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.880
 teaching as an alibi for this 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.010
 reproduction operation but which in 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.850
 same time can not do without this 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.300
 mask actually performed for one hand 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.920
 this talent transmission and its 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.480
 deep ambivalence that she can 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.420
 to achieve those goals that put 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.860
 implementing procedures that tries without 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.710
 stop at the same time to thwart them 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.930
 we know that the French school which is a 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.490
 place of permanent reform is at the same 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.710
 time the place of their cancellation 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.310
 permed 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.649
 nothing else counts in 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.040
 basically that politico objective 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.200
 ideological that assigned him the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.580
 republic that made it one of its 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.790
 pillars which is the objective can be 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.130
 to formulate in a very simple way the school 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.110
 aims to produce failure 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.420
 school 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.580
 to be complete we must add as well 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.640
 a modest percentage of success 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.459
 school and this in such a way that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.370
 this failure do not appear as the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.810
 result of the institution itself 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.450
 as the consequence of the defects 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.350
 behavioral and psychological and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.989
 morals of those who frequent them 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.400
 students and students 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.420
 so it's a wonderful machine of a 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.890
 visibility of the key production of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.980
 the whole social of all classes of 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.010
 any breakdown class society 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.010
 that of obedience and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.950
 acceptance of social garages on 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.030
 understands from there the vice of form 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.260
 of the traditional business that 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.620
 tries to find ways to 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.110
 reform the school to reduce failure 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.610
 school as much want to ask to 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.989
 the school to be the opposite of this 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.239
 that she is and yet by virtue of 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.940
 the ambivalence indicated previously 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.370
 there is also a doubling of the means 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.049
 to disrupt this functioning which 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.879
 contains in itself the seeds of its 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.319
 contradiction especially through 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.560
 the existence of an instruction to 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.340
 critical dimension we come to this 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.269
 paradox that school a transformable 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.440
 for the above reasons says 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.120
 and at the same time quite easy to deform 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.390
 we can briefly indicate 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.129
 possible deformation factors it 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.560
 relies largely on 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.840
 mentality changes more than on 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.030
 means increases and we will go 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.660
 so here not against current speech 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.419
 traditional trade unions 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.849
 the central point to touch 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:12.150
 but it's hard to admit 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.190
 is the question of evaluation 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.889
 it's not about evaluating anymore but 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.820
 to evaluate things and not the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.950
 people disconnect the transmission 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.960
 knowledge of the training of 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.610
 identity 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.160
 act 5 that can happen at any 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.800
 moment every day in every 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.200
 classes aim to 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.110
 produce knowledge and not 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.120
 types of people was given by 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.979
 example to any student 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.490
 the opportunity to redo as much as it is 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.520
 necessary 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.349
 the assimilation journey until 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.970
 that this is concretized in a 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.539
 reality in accordance with the objective 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.560
 defined levies as long as this 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.889
 goal is not achieved 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.960
 no evaluation is required to be at 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.420
 unless you want to explicitly 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.940
 stigmatization of a slow delay 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.870
 a brief incapacity of a classification 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.370
 and exclusion and then we go out 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.270
 of a teaching logic to be 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.970
 clearly in a political logic 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.130
 this attitude that does not cost in lift 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.450
 nothing or so little 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.860
 obviously leads step by step 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.020
 innumerable consequence of tournon 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.000
 questioning of the canon law and 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.110
 yet aberrant of a curriculum 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.550
 organized according to age classes 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.080
 paradigm shift to think the 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.510
 school work no longer as a 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.390
 working on oneself but as a job 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.530
 on a topic and therefore opening on 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.270
 rule models in social work 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.160
 normal 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.050
 and let's remember that marx was 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.080
 strongly opposed to compulsory schooling 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.060
 in a special institution for the benefit of a 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.160
 training not just technical but 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.740
 also speculative literary related to 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.330
 world of work 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.710
 serious reflection on 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.910
 disadvantages of compulsory schooling 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.410
 in its current rigidity and vice versa 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.720
 on the salutary organization of a 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.960
 universal lifelong learning 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.150
 long life abandoning debates 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.970
 sterile around pedagogy for a 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.490
 decidedly non- pedagogical practice or to 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.070
 teaching pedagogy what we have 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.210
 could call the term obviously pose of 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.520
 many problems 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.890
 the natural method that applies to all 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.830
 levels and in all disciplines 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.080
 learning a real written language 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.210
 reading real books allows 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.910
 to discard these teratological objects that 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.500
 are the textbooks 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.600
 an example in the field of sciences 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.760
 especially the interest turn to the 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.110
 science being done and not 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.500
 towards it was to death of knowledge 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.270
 bachelard scientist already denounced 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.440
 would allow a real release of 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.510
 these disciplines like mathematics 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.400
 the physics that are today 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.860
 shamefully served as an instrument of 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.110
 selection of people selection for 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.370
 give a new impetus 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.130
 to these tools of understanding the world 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.320
 natural and technical 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.420
 such a cultural revolution would have for 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.130
 effect and this is not the least of 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.820
 completely put in the hands of 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.390
 policies 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.910
 the thankless task then abandoned by 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.720
 the school of stigma 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.830
 source of voluntary servitude 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.450
 identity that would continue to confer 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.850
 colas its members on that of 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.670
 equal citizens in rights despite their 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.920
 differences in rhythm and style 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.140
 of appropriation of the assets it would remain 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.350
 then to invent authentic 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.460
 social integration procedure which does not 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.470
 would be more masked by 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.760
 pedagogical manipulations but who 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.690
 appears very openly for this 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.690
 that they are political choices 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.670
 2 

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.670
 and
