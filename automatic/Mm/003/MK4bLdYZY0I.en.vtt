always I was trying to make to make it a
nice<00:00:10.290> race<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:11.040> not<00:00:11.190> only<00:00:11.340> important<00:00:12.269> for

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.019 
the result I think it's also important
for<00:00:15.230> for<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> head<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.550> for

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
for for the head a little bit and for

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.769 
for for the head a little bit and for
the<00:00:18.090> sensation<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> climbs<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.439> race

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
that's why i was i was doing a few big

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
that's why i was i was doing a few big
attracts<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.570> wasn't<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.019> saving

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
attracts and I wasn't really saving

try and yeah it's also when you win in
the<00:01:46.649> sprint<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.100> different<00:01:47.640> than<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.270> when

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the sprint it's different than and when

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450
