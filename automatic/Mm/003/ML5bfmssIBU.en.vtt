off<00:02:43.740> with<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> mortar<00:02:44.250> shot<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.270> harder<00:02:45.600> to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
off with a mortar shot this is harder to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.960 
off with a mortar shot this is harder to
do<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.440> lead<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.800> shot<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.459> super

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.210 

now<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.330> brig<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.840> incapacitated<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.980> can

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
now the brig is incapacitated so we can

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.880 
now the brig is incapacitated so we can
board<00:02:54.550> him<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:54.910> we<00:02:55.180> choose<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.660> but<00:02:56.500> since<00:02:56.680> we

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
board him if we choose to but since we

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.620 
board him if we choose to but since we
still<00:02:57.099> have<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> tower<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.700> deal<00:02:57.849> with<00:02:58.060> we'll

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
still have a tower to deal with we'll

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.830 
still have a tower to deal with we'll
take<00:02:58.810> him<00:02:58.959> down<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.410> go<00:02:59.560> finish<00:02:59.860> off<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.160> boy

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.930 

even<00:03:06.530> though<00:03:06.680> we<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.280> port<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.790> these

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
even though we can the port and these

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.089 
even though we can the port and these
towers<00:03:08.360> still<00:03:08.599> do<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> lot<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.200> damage<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:09.980> we

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
towers still do a lot of damage so we

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:25.060 
towers still do a lot of damage so we
still<00:03:10.310> have<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.550> brace<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:11.000> defend<00:03:11.270> ourselves

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.470 

now<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> towers<00:03:26.760> are<00:03:26.910> down<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.330> we<00:03:27.390> need

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
now that the towers are down and we need

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.660 
now that the towers are down and we need
to<00:03:27.600> infiltrate<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.320> capture<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.800> sport<00:03:29.100> to

capture a for it you need to find and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.910 
capture a for it you need to find and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
kill the four commandments

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.220 
kill the four commandments
seemlessly<00:03:33.670> we<00:03:33.970> go<00:03:34.120> from<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.540> navel<00:03:34.840> straight

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
seemlessly we go from the navel straight

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.110 
seemlessly we go from the navel straight
into<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> four<00:03:35.860> tower<00:03:36.069> we<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.700> destroyed

the<00:03:37.930> seamless<00:03:38.319> concept<00:03:38.739> was<00:03:38.860> something<00:03:39.190> we

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
the seamless concept was something we

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.100 
the seamless concept was something we
