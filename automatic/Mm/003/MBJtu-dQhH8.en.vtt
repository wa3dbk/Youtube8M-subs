00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.440
 hello everyone today rests 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.820
 on black hole I hope you 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.800
 I'm really good 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.320
 today I'm going to help you lose 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.080
 more points or to make also two of 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.570
 best waves on newton our zombies 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.240
 so I hope it's really going to get you 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.850
 help you really have to if you follow the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.990
 video you really have way of 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.910
 resist more easily already for 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.309
 start you could I advise you the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.170
 plunging on the wrong way for more 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.640
 phase iii at the friends who are invaded 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.800
 which are translated and instead of 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.719
 finally wait for the most points you 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.579
 does four five balls on a zombie and 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.879
 you ass then you are to do 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.989
 many more points and then the time 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.440
 that you are in the first three 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.539
 waves 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.609
 you must continue to do this 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.460
 strategy because I think it's 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.350
 which brings the most points 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.289
 after as soon as you see you have enough 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.510
 money always year when alas he 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.760
 cash in the Loire for now 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.190
 in fact from the beginning we will already see a 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.930
 now why not here I had 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.530
 already a pretty good weapon that have a 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.150
 fall and already so that was for a more 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.260
 great facility that always go there 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.630
 where that drinks falls because 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.800
 when you know it's not up to 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.900
 rooms are at the turret 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.820
 they are seeing this from the very beginning for 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.340
 activate the teddies you saw at 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.780
 beginning there is the bus it takes on the small 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.510
 market there is a trick this one is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.270
 behind the white house and the other 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.990
 noos he's just at the top of 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 the house everything just play 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.460
 this barricade he simply on 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.960
 the link of this agent to the cd that you 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.189
 activate it you have a music and if 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.350
 you want to see the music but I will 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.750
 propose to go see this video as 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.909
 see that's what for drinks 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.630
 otherwise you are told that you left 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.229
 tray 5 or 6 exane open behind the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.880
 White House 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.420
 I think it's the best place 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.390
 that resist bah you expect them 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.880
 zombies elsewhere for him it's a little 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 like me kill you his big band you 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.569
 we still do not need to turn 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.850
 you make quiet points and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.260
 after sounding that you are saving for 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.370
 no points especially always have to 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.840
 to make money or even 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.730
 best-selling endemic plants 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.980
 for the strategy it takes these are 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.239
 contracts won by love clare comics or 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 weapons are I think the best 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.830
 then you as soon as there is a beginning of 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.950
 sleeve it's always good to throw 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.600
 your grenades on the throne of zombies 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.200
 like for example here for already delayed 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.310
 a little bit they say q you have 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.019
 money as I told you you 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.910
 buy masto this is the most important 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.590
 for the strategy also why not 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.390
 speed colas if you want and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.040
 rapid resuscitation but I do not have that 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.209
 and I just had speed corner in the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.570
 part but I did not really 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.060
 need 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.489
 but I did not have rapid resuscitation 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.500
 if not after as soon as the widow or the games 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.269
 are already starting to fall here all saints 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 in fact you just have to be like me 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.609
 I do it is I think the best 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.440
 strategy on recipes but I can 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.090
 tell you that when this with its 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.489
 strategies even though just online because 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.780
 that the source gone I was online the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.410
 missed people I do not know 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.320
 but in addition the parliament 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.330
 it is from a wave yes I had 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.920
 already started to do this this strategy 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.350
 is actually the strategy it's always 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.230
 that but we can see that sometimes we 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.720
 fact that will approach the strategy is 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.520
 very well but here if you going through 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.290
 a friend comes it's possible that sometimes 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.450
 it gets stuck for that you start to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.870
 shoot everything it's jesus christ several 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.270
 times where that can go but really 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.950
 limit was really worth role could have 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.200
 immediately to when even 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.490
 pretty good sensitivity always turned 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.250
 but see for all still have to 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.380
 two is largely achievable with 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.820
 peaks do that with friends this moment 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.900
 possible to do a very big wave 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.120
 and I'm talking about at least a good dough 30 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.780
 and frankly I know what I think about 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.000
 meyer vice 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.000
 you see that I realize and that there is 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.200
 a new bond that will fall there 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.660
 always have to look where she falls 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.550
 morality there he falls if I looked 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.890
 always to important successes of the 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.020
 less is my passage to yet 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.730
 even if the motion is fine but I 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.560
 did not need him so is in 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.390
 does more advanced in the waves more 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.940
 favor of zombies I have a member he is 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.290
 available release was to kill 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.040
 you have to let them spawn and who 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.740
 all add up behind you for 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.450
 the burqa does not have much in fact I I 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.550
 kill them that's normal only at the beginning 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.390
 and you can see that my charming art 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.480
 very quickly 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.920
 that's why a very good 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.110
 strategy because it's simple a 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.580
 dentist is what the super money 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.440
 quick 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.970
 but really super vote not on his 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.130
 parties I will not do it anyway 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.790
 unique seeland was not sure but to go 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.520
 was not super run was not great 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.410
 strong but I still managed their 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.930
 bac and i7 and it was mostly my last 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.540
 part if you saw at first that I 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.070
 did not have 2 of our party that I 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.750
 did not really play today 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.090
 especially on this map you saw that 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.440
 the party before it goes and a demented 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.330
 and that's the way it's because in fact there 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.860
 have to turn around while avoiding the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.280
 zombies that you have parked behind 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.600
 but if that that encircles the meaning we are 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.340
 always in the sense that I turn a 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.310
 many others it is much more 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.440
 complicated i think bah for me you if 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.450
 you want to taste 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.970
 and then I turn I turn and I he 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.890
 must do really that after we love 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.780
 or four other centers it's best 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.780
 count on bing but it's mostly to 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.330
 from the bacteria 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.680
 were then there will be more zombies 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.750
 which is much longer so 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.310
 ammunition for its hotter beta but 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.590
 especially for his zombies you see 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.090
 that he advances to two by the hour and zombies 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.810
 who sees the same speed as in the morning 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.850
 it's super annoying that why that it 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.169
 beats me I advise that we should 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.220
 kills the fastest what if you 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.200
 are really France 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.200
 if you can not kill them you do not 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.690
 do nothing but if I could really 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.889
 on it because they are actually this 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.360
 that bother you anyway because they 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.700
 him who do not have fast enough he'll be 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.140
 it does not sound to go to more than 4 is it 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.840
 must be in front of you and you 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.130
 block without making a blocked money then 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.750
 there you hit all those air 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.130
 there you see that it's a moment that 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.260
 I was shocking to see how it goes 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.790
 not eelv and especially not really do 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.080
 turn around you have to shoot everything had in the 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.780
 treatment 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.720
 that's why you really need everything 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.250
 strategy there always have to keep 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.930
 it really happens all the time miss 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.150
 do not think we are feeling an era 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.360
 to make a strategy there the part of 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.220
 final and lasted almost two hours but 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.080
 I act to make a package for you 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.190
 say that to make your time it 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.660
 was going to change jacket 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.390
 I have already made a lot of mistakes at 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.310
 bath thanks to this strategy you 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.650
 still have the end of the metal path and that 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.270
 do not leave but it does not really bother 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.880
 not in seaweed if you can 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.770
 always thanks to this area do 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.490
 something to avoid zombies 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.199
 so I hope it's 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.180
 the strategy that will have helped you because 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.610
 that I think it's a very 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.289
 good strategy this circus video and if he 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.120
 please you can tell me if this 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.940
 strategy has helped us it's mostly 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.889
 even if you do not have to resist 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.970
 we want to make a lot of money for them 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.970
 beat everyone
