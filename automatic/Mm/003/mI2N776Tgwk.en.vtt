00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800 
wasn't good enough and I would just tell
anyone<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.910> stick<00:01:54.150> with<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.600> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
anyone just stick with it because it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.020 
anyone just stick with it because it
actually<00:01:54.960> gets<00:01:55.229> easier<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.940> know

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
actually gets easier and you know

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
actually gets easier and you know
eventually<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.660> pays<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.350> program<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
eventually it pays off the program that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
eventually it pays off the program that
I<00:01:59.070> did<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> did<00:01:59.580> an<00:01:59.670> accelerated<00:02:00.360> program

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
I did I did an accelerated program

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
I did I did an accelerated program

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.990 
assistant for a year and a half to get a
seat<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> had<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.100> an<00:02:05.190> internship<00:02:05.490> after

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
seat so I had to do an internship after

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.510 
seat so I had to do an internship after
that<00:02:06.530> probably<00:02:07.530> waited<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.009> four<00:02:08.369> months

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that probably waited about four months

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.310 
that probably waited about four months

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
tested to the board's I actually

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
tested to the board's I actually
couldn't<00:02:12.240> practice<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.930> about<00:02:13.080> four<00:02:13.290> months

couldn't practice for about four months

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340 
couldn't practice for about four months

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
I just started right away I was excited

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
I just started right away I was excited
I<00:02:18.690> passed

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
I passed

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.310 
I passed
that's<00:02:20.100> all<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> care<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.700> real<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:21.450> guess<00:02:21.900> like

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
that's all I care in a real I guess like

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.350 
that's all I care in a real I guess like
when<00:02:22.470> people<00:02:22.560> want<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.520> know<00:02:23.550> answers<00:02:23.850> or

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
when people want to know answers or

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.780 
when people want to know answers or
curious<00:02:24.989> about<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.950> field<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.370> lot<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.580> people

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
curious about this field a lot of people

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.720 
curious about this field a lot of people
don't<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.840> enough<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.410> or<00:02:28.730> have

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
don't know what enough to is or have

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.210 
don't know what enough to is or have
never<00:02:29.940> even<00:02:30.060> heard<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> guess<00:02:31.440> you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
never even heard of this so I guess you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.190 
never even heard of this so I guess you
know<00:02:32.340> people<00:02:32.640> who<00:02:32.760> are<00:02:32.880> interested<00:02:33.360> or<00:02:33.540> people

know people who are interested or people

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.780 
know people who are interested or people
who<00:02:34.320> even<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.739> me<00:02:34.920> working<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.550> they<00:02:35.670> could

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
who even see me working here they could

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.430 
who even see me working here they could
just<00:02:35.940> google<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.420> or<00:02:36.510> something<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> find<00:02:37.290> out

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
just google it or something and find out

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:54.180 
just google it or something and find out
exactly<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.070> is

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190
