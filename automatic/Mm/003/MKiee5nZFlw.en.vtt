00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
one way of fixing it which is usually

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.110 
one way of fixing it which is usually
the<00:03:31.680> easy<00:03:31.889> way<00:03:32.099> when<00:03:32.340> both<00:03:32.519> sides<00:03:32.729> are<00:03:32.909> joined

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the easy way when both sides are joined

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.129 
the easy way when both sides are joined
together<00:03:34.370> I'm<00:03:35.370> going<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.579> give<00:03:35.729> you

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
together I'm going to give you

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.800 
together I'm going to give you
instructions<00:03:37.139> on<00:03:37.829> how<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.329> put<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.479> zippers

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
instructions on how to put the zippers

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.659 
instructions on how to put the zippers
back<00:03:40.139> together<00:03:40.530> when<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:41.010> two<00:03:41.190> sides<00:03:41.459> have

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
back together when the two sides have

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.430 
back together when the two sides have
come<00:03:41.849> apart<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.959> little<00:03:43.199> bit<00:03:43.290> more

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
come apart this is a little bit more

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.530 
come apart this is a little bit more
tricky<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.760> good<00:03:44.909> this<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.329> going<00:03:45.479> to

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
tricky and it's good this is going to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.539 
tricky and it's good this is going to
take<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> little<00:03:45.870> bit<00:03:46.019> more<00:03:46.199> work<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:47.280> what<00:03:47.430> you

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
take a little bit more work but what you

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.119 
take a little bit more work but what you
want<00:03:47.729> to<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:47.909> is<00:03:48.120> create<00:03:48.510> yourself<00:03:48.659> a<00:03:49.139> gap

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
want to do is create yourself a gap

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.689 
want to do is create yourself a gap
again<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:51.030> we<00:03:51.180> did<00:03:51.209> earlier<00:03:51.629> so<00:03:52.459> what<00:03:53.459> if

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
again like we did earlier so what if

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.159 
again like we did earlier so what if
they're<00:03:53.909> if<00:03:54.120> they've<00:03:54.299> separated<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:55.049> make

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
they're if they've separated just make

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.449 
they're if they've separated just make
sure<00:03:55.319> you<00:03:55.409> give<00:03:55.560> yourself<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:56.010> gap<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.370> you

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
sure you give yourself a gap but you

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.800 
sure you give yourself a gap but you
want<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.639> make<00:03:56.790> sure<00:03:56.909> that<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> gap<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.329> even

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
want to make sure that the gap is even

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.300 
want to make sure that the gap is even
on<00:03:57.930> both<00:03:57.959> sides<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:58.560> if<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.739> decide<00:03:59.040> on<00:03:59.159> two

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
on both sides so if you decide on two

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
on both sides so if you decide on two
inches<00:03:59.579> make<00:03:59.879> sure<00:04:00.000> your<00:04:00.120> gapping<00:04:00.510> two<00:04:00.629> inches

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
inches make sure your gapping two inches

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.899 
inches make sure your gapping two inches
you<00:04:01.019> can<00:04:01.139> mark<00:04:01.379> it<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.709> take<00:04:02.430> off<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.729> teeth

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
you can mark it and take off the teeth

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.449 
you can mark it and take off the teeth
using<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.359> pliers<00:04:03.599> now<00:04:04.040> what<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.159> have<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.340> do

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
using the pliers now what you have to do

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.069 
using the pliers now what you have to do
is<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.639> have<00:04:05.729> to<00:04:05.790> reverse<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.419> so<00:04:06.599> essentially

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
is you have to reverse it so essentially

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.099 
is you have to reverse it so essentially
you're<00:04:07.650> going<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.829> be<00:04:07.889> putting<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.250> slider<00:04:08.609> on

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
you're going to be putting the slider on

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.780 
you're going to be putting the slider on
reversed<00:04:10.109> when<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.220> zipper<00:04:11.459> teeth<00:04:11.579> were

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
reversed when the zipper teeth were

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.089 
reversed when the zipper teeth were
together<00:04:12.269> we're<00:04:13.169> able<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.769> using<00:04:13.949> the

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
together we're able to do it using the

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.420 
together we're able to do it using the
mouth<00:04:14.629> okay<00:04:15.629> what<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:16.560> need<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.769> do<00:04:16.889> now<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.280> we

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
mouth okay what we need to do now is we

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.330 
mouth okay what we need to do now is we
need<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.699> turn<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.970> over<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.630> slide<00:04:19.340> both

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
need to turn it over and you slide both

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.730 
need to turn it over and you slide both
sides<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.909> zippers<00:04:21.269> through<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.289> head<00:04:22.560> of

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
sides of the zippers through the head of

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.600 
sides of the zippers through the head of
the<00:04:22.889> zipper<00:04:23.219> and<00:04:23.400> then<00:04:24.330> you

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the zipper and then you

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.339 
the zipper and then you
you're<00:04:25.030> going<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.330> need<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.569> join<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:26.020> because

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
you're going to need to join it because

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.510 
you're going to need to join it because
what<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.680> going<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.830> do<00:04:27.009> it's<00:04:27.159> going<00:04:27.189> to<00:04:27.340> go

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
what it's going to do it's going to go

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.830 
what it's going to do it's going to go
through<00:04:28.289> these<00:04:29.289> two<00:04:29.349> sides<00:04:29.860> of<00:04:30.539> your<00:04:31.539> slider

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
through these two sides of your slider

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.939 
through these two sides of your slider
and<00:04:32.759> then<00:04:33.759> it's<00:04:33.909> going<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.120> be<00:04:34.210> joined<00:04:34.710> at<00:04:35.710> the

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
and then it's going to be joined at the

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.129 
and then it's going to be joined at the
bottom<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.430> little<00:04:37.210> bit<00:04:37.330> hard<00:04:37.569> to<00:04:37.629> understand

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
bottom a little bit hard to understand

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.029 
bottom a little bit hard to understand
but<00:04:38.259> let's<00:04:38.560> do<00:04:38.770> it

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
but let's do it

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.510 
but let's do it
see<00:04:39.280> if<00:04:39.340> we<00:04:39.490> could<00:04:39.639> make<00:04:40.509> this<00:04:40.659> happen<00:04:40.719> so

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
see if we could make this happen so

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.550 
see if we could make this happen so
you're<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.699> take<00:04:42.819> your<00:04:42.969> slider<00:04:43.560> and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
you're going to take your slider and

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.749 
you're going to take your slider and
you're<00:04:44.830> going<00:04:44.949> to<00:04:44.979> take<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.250> reverse<00:04:45.490> side

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
you're going to take the reverse side

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.300 
you're going to take the reverse side
you're<00:04:45.909> going<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.060> put<00:04:46.210> one<00:04:46.389> side<00:04:46.629> through

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
you're going to put one side through

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.529 
you're going to put one side through
just<00:04:48.310> get<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.580> down<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.729> about<00:04:48.909> the<00:04:49.090> teeth<00:04:49.360> and

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
just get it down to about the teeth and

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.360 
just get it down to about the teeth and
you<00:04:49.599> can<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:50.439> turn<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.770> over<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.039> you<00:04:51.159> look

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
you can you turn it over and you look

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.740 
you can you turn it over and you look
through<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.669> mouth<00:04:51.849> you<00:04:52.120> can<00:04:52.270> kind<00:04:52.479> of<00:04:52.539> see

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
through the mouth you can kind of see

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.899 
through the mouth you can kind of see
and<00:04:52.990> get<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.919> get<00:04:54.009> an<00:04:54.099> idea<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.430> where<00:04:54.669> your

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
and get to get an idea of where your

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.779 
and get to get an idea of where your
teeth<00:04:55.120> are<00:04:55.270> falling<00:04:55.330> inside<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.080> slider<00:04:56.349> so

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
teeth are falling inside the slider so

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.860 
teeth are falling inside the slider so
you<00:04:57.789> take<00:04:58.029> your<00:04:58.180> other<00:04:58.240> side<00:04:58.479> you're<00:04:58.689> going<00:04:58.779> to

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
you take your other side you're going to

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.839 
you take your other side you're going to
put<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.020> through<00:04:59.349> and<00:04:59.680> here's<00:05:00.610> where<00:05:00.819> the

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
put that through and here's where the

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.149 
put that through and here's where the
key<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.479> want<00:05:01.509> to<00:05:01.689> look<00:05:01.840> down<00:05:02.110> into<00:05:02.409> the

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
key is you want to look down into the

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.700 
key is you want to look down into the
slider<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.789> make<00:05:04.569> sure<00:05:04.779> that<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.080> teeth<00:05:05.319> are

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
slider and make sure that the teeth are
