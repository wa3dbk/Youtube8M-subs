stills<00:00:23.210> 17<00:00:24.210> millimeters<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.350> wide<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.400> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
stills 17 millimeters is wide on that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.779 
stills 17 millimeters is wide on that
full<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> grain<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.230> take<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.650> same<00:00:29.039> 17

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
full of grain but if I take that same 17

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
full of grain but if I take that same 17
millimeters<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.599> put<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> 1<00:00:31.650> 6<00:00:31.920> crop

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
millimeters and put it on a 1 6 crop

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.620 
millimeters and put it on a 1 6 crop
sensor<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.719> wide<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> need<00:00:35.130> more

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630
