is locking up the moisture so you have

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.420 
is locking up the moisture so you have
less<00:02:03.799> grease<00:02:04.070> penetration<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:06.250> I've<00:02:07.250> added

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
less grease penetration so I've added

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.160 
less grease penetration so I've added
the<00:02:07.670> apples<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.299> little<00:02:08.570> bit<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:08.989> kickdown

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
the apples a little bit of kickdown

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.860 
the apples a little bit of kickdown
flour<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.209> use<00:02:11.329> quite<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.630> bit<00:02:11.690> of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
flour and I like to use quite a bit of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.610 
flour and I like to use quite a bit of
cinnamon<00:02:12.430> when<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.549> fry<00:02:13.880> an<00:02:14.030> apple<00:02:14.299> fritter

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
cinnamon when you fry an apple fritter

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.979 
cinnamon when you fry an apple fritter
remember<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:16.150> not<00:02:17.150> only<00:02:17.359> is<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.450> product

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
remember that not only is that product

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.640 
remember that not only is that product
proofed<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.070> then<00:02:19.459> fried<00:02:20.260> yet<00:02:21.260> also

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
proofed and and then fried yet also

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.920 
proofed and and then fried yet also
because<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.640> proofing<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> Frank<00:02:23.390> tends

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
because of the proofing and Frank tends

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.349 
because of the proofing and Frank tends
to<00:02:24.109> dilute<00:02:24.440> flavors<00:02:24.889> so<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.430> add<00:02:25.699> a<00:02:26.000> lot<00:02:26.209> of

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
to dilute flavors so I add a lot of

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.210 
to dilute flavors so I add a lot of
cinnamon

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
cinnamon

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.410

what<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.250> do<00:02:30.370> differently<00:02:30.820> at<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.090> stage<00:02:31.270> I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
what I do differently at this stage I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.120 
what I do differently at this stage I
usually<00:02:31.750> log<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.830> would<00:02:33.010> be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
usually log it up like I would be

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.390 
usually log it up like I would be
cutting<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.490> Persian<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.860> instead<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:35.920> using<00:02:36.160> a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
cutting a Persian and instead of using a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400 
cutting a Persian and instead of using a
bench<00:02:36.610> scraper<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.810> use<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> French

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
bench scraper I like to use a French

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.000 
bench scraper I like to use a French
knife<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:39.010> think<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.850> cuts<00:02:40.030> quick<00:02:40.720> quicker<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
knife I think it cuts quick quicker so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.380

what I'm looking for here is I'm going
to<00:02:43.450> go<00:02:43.540> through<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.840> dough<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:45.780> then<00:02:46.860> back

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
to go through this dough and then back

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.710 
to go through this dough and then back
this<00:02:48.100> way<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.730> what<00:02:48.910> I'm<00:02:49.000> looking<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.600> to

this way and what I'm looking for is to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.740 
this way and what I'm looking for is to
get<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.960> pieces<00:02:50.220> about<00:02:51.220> as<00:02:51.460> small<00:02:51.790> as<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
get the pieces about as small as the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.710 
get the pieces about as small as the
apple<00:02:53.400> filling<00:02:54.400> if<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.000> make<00:02:55.180> them<00:02:55.330> too<00:02:55.390> large

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
apple filling if you make them too large

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.990 
apple filling if you make them too large
they<00:02:56.050> tend<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.350> pull<00:02:56.560> apart<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.490> fryer<00:02:57.610> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
they tend to pull apart in the fryer and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.970 
they tend to pull apart in the fryer and
we're<00:02:58.900> going<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.080> try<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.380> avoid<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.830> by

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
we're going to try to avoid that by

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.670 
we're going to try to avoid that by
making<00:03:00.310> small<00:03:00.520> pieces<00:03:01.140> ok<00:03:02.140> we've<00:03:02.320> chopped

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
making small pieces ok we've chopped

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.110 
making small pieces ok we've chopped
through<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.950> donut<00:03:03.220> we've<00:03:03.700> gotten<00:03:04.030> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
through the donut we've gotten the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.960 
through the donut we've gotten the
pieces<00:03:04.480> about<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.840> size<00:03:05.050> of<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.790> Apple<00:03:06.790> which

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
pieces about the size of the Apple which

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.600 
pieces about the size of the Apple which
I'd<00:03:07.150> say<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.360> about<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> minimum<00:03:07.900> size<00:03:08.610> then

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
I'd say is about a minimum size then

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.430 
I'd say is about a minimum size then
what<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.820> would<00:03:10.060> suggest<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.690> do<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.990> chop<00:03:11.260> off

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
what I would suggest you do is chop off

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.430 
what I would suggest you do is chop off
the<00:03:11.560> size<00:03:11.740> pieces<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.310> want<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.440> roll

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
the size pieces that you want and roll

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.140 
the size pieces that you want and roll
them<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:14.650> flour<00:03:14.830> flatten<00:03:15.640> with<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.910> palm<00:03:16.120> of

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
them in flour flatten with the palm of

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.140 
them in flour flatten with the palm of
your<00:03:16.270> hand<00:03:16.360> what<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.080> does<00:03:17.350> is<00:03:17.890> seals<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
your hand what that does is seals up the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.060 
your hand what that does is seals up the
pores<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.960> fissures<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.830> allow<00:03:21.010> the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
pores and the fissures that allow the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.090 
pores and the fissures that allow the
steam<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> or<00:03:22.000> they<00:03:22.180> allow<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.950> grease<00:03:23.950> to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
steam to or they allow the grease to

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.430 
steam to or they allow the grease to
penetrate<00:03:24.550> one<00:03:25.420> thing<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.690> didn't<00:03:25.990> cover<00:03:26.140> too

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
penetrate one thing I didn't cover too

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.080 
penetrate one thing I didn't cover too
is<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.800> reason<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.220> use<00:03:27.280> cake<00:03:27.760> donut

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
is the reason that I use cake donut

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.410 
is the reason that I use cake donut
flour<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:29.410> want<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.250> emphasize<00:03:30.730> how<00:03:30.940> important

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
flour I want to emphasize how important

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.290 
flour I want to emphasize how important
that<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.830> if<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:33.220> look<00:03:34.030> at<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.270> fryer<00:03:34.900> full<00:03:35.200> of

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
that is if you look at a fryer full of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.580 
that is if you look at a fryer full of
frying<00:03:37.300> fritters<00:03:37.840> you'll<00:03:38.230> see<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.410> lot<00:03:38.560> of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
frying fritters you'll see a lot of

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.729 
frying fritters you'll see a lot of
steam<00:03:38.920> escaping<00:03:39.480> what<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.870> physically

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
steam escaping what that is physically

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.040 
steam escaping what that is physically
is<00:03:42.070> as<00:03:42.520> that<00:03:42.700> steam<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.030> escaping<00:03:43.690> it's

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
is as that steam is escaping it's

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.479 
is as that steam is escaping it's
causing<00:03:44.500> grease<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.830> penetrate<00:03:45.280> so

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
causing grease to penetrate so

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.880 
causing grease to penetrate so
physically<00:03:46.060> as<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.420> steam<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.110> escaping<00:03:47.770> its

going<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.550> soaking<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.270> lot<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.450> grease<00:03:49.690> so

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
going in soaking in a lot of grease so

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.660 
going in soaking in a lot of grease so
we're<00:03:50.020> trying<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.290> prevent<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.620> by<00:03:51.370> binding

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
we're trying to prevent that by binding

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.420 
we're trying to prevent that by binding
up<00:03:51.940> these<00:03:52.090> apples<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.980> cake<00:03:54.160> donut

up these apples with the cake donut

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.280 
up these apples with the cake donut
flour<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:54.940> we're<00:03:55.150> not<00:03:55.270> over<00:03:55.510> frying<00:03:55.780> which

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
flour so we're not over frying which

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.800 
flour so we're not over frying which
also<00:03:56.590> causes<00:03:57.010> grease<00:03:57.220> penetration<00:03:57.880> we're

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
also causes grease penetration we're

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.229 
also causes grease penetration we're
