00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.550 
still have the white it just is it's
going<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.010> go<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.160> color<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.760> lot<00:03:29.970> faster<00:03:30.300> if<00:03:30.840> i

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
going to go to color a lot faster if i

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.729 
going to go to color a lot faster if i
mix<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.280> blue<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.820> could<00:03:33.030> see<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.739> but

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
mix the blue in I could see it but

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.020 
mix the blue in I could see it but
through<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.980> camera<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.580> hard<00:03:35.850> time

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
through the camera I have a hard time

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.120 
through the camera I have a hard time
seeing<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.510> but

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
seeing it but

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.730 
seeing it but
does<00:03:37.250> have<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> blue<00:03:37.700> tint<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.740> it's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
does have a blue tint to it so it's

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.110 
does have a blue tint to it so it's
definitely<00:03:40.070> going<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.280> work<00:03:40.430> for<00:03:40.730> what<00:03:41.090> I

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
definitely going to work for what I

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.930 
definitely going to work for what I
needed<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.570> do<00:03:41.860> anyway<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.340> was<00:03:43.520> that's

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
needed to do anyway so that was that's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.440 
needed to do anyway so that was that's
the<00:03:44.060> outline<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.830> kind<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.940> map

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the outline and and the kind of the map

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.330 
the outline and and the kind of the map
if<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.720> will<00:03:47.870> as<00:03:48.290> Mike<00:03:48.530> Lavallee<00:03:48.890> calls<00:03:49.160> it

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
if you will as Mike Lavallee calls it

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.340 
if you will as Mike Lavallee calls it
and<00:03:49.540> that's<00:03:50.540> where<00:03:50.750> we're<00:03:50.870> going<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.050> go<00:03:51.080> off

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
and that's where we're going to go off

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.170 
and that's where we're going to go off
with<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.680> fire<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.550> we're<00:03:52.850> going<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> put<00:03:53.120> some

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
with the fire so we're going to put some

detailed<00:04:20.360> with<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.660> stencil<00:04:21.110> I<00:04:21.520> have<00:04:22.520> a

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
detailed with the stencil I have a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.510 
detailed with the stencil I have a
tendency<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.060> really<00:04:23.690> throw<00:04:24.410> some<00:04:24.620> stylized

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520

tendency to really throw some stylized
type<00:04:26.450> fire<00:04:27.200> in<00:04:27.380> there<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.560> really<00:04:27.920> dig<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.310> when

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
type fire in there I really dig it when

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.190

you can darken the lions or brighten the
lines<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.560> little<00:04:30.590> bit<00:04:30.980> but<00:04:31.640> now<00:04:31.790> I'll<00:04:31.910> push<00:04:32.090> it

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
lines a little bit but now I'll push it

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.720 
lines a little bit but now I'll push it

really far back with the candy and I'll

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.970 
really far back with the candy and I'll
go<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.030> highlight<00:04:35.450> just<00:04:35.780> little<00:04:36.320> tiny<00:04:36.530> areas

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
go and highlight just little tiny areas

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.330 
go and highlight just little tiny areas
not<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.280> lot<00:04:37.640> but<00:04:37.910> just<00:04:38.180> enough<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:39.010> kind<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.130> see

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
not a lot but just enough to kind of see

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
not a lot but just enough to kind of see
it<00:04:40.430> i'll<00:04:40.610> use<00:04:40.760> my<00:04:40.790> airbrush<00:04:41.740> for<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.860> step<00:04:43.360> to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
it i'll use my airbrush for that step to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.620 
it i'll use my airbrush for that step to
kind<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.780> push<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.110> back<00:04:45.260> just<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.560> tad<00:04:45.800> but

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
kind of push it back just a tad but

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.530 
kind of push it back just a tad but
basically<00:04:47.630> that's<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.380> in<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.530> nutshell<00:04:48.560> so

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
basically that's it in a nutshell so

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.700 
basically that's it in a nutshell so
that's<00:04:50.540> what<00:04:50.750> they<00:04:50.870> look<00:04:51.020> like<00:04:51.080> we'll<00:04:51.500> come

back with a candy coat and you can see
what<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.570> looks<00:04:53.600> like<00:04:53.870> when<00:04:54.080> it's<00:04:54.230> all<00:04:54.380> done

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
kind of really darkened them up always

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.080 
kind of really darkened them up always
in<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.800> camera<00:05:01.130> for<00:05:01.370> some<00:05:01.580> reason<00:05:01.940> they

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
in the camera for some reason they

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.430 
in the camera for some reason they
always<00:05:02.330> look<00:05:02.510> brighter<00:05:02.780> than<00:05:02.990> what<00:05:03.170> they<00:05:03.290> are

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
always look brighter than what they are

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.150 
always look brighter than what they are
but<00:05:04.070> they<00:05:04.280> are<00:05:04.310> fairly<00:05:05.150> dark<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:06.160> with

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
but they are fairly dark and with

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.830 
but they are fairly dark and with
another<00:05:07.460> coat<00:05:07.700> of<00:05:07.730> candy<00:05:08.300> over<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.510> top<00:05:08.660> it's

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
another coat of candy over the top it's

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.720 
another coat of candy over the top it's
going<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.050> push<00:05:09.200> him<00:05:09.320> back<00:05:09.440> even<00:05:09.500> further<00:05:09.950> when

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
going to push him back even further when

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.840 
going to push him back even further when
the<00:05:11.030> little<00:05:11.570> white<00:05:11.750> highlights<00:05:12.200> go<00:05:12.380> in<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.850> it

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
the little white highlights go in and it

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.370 
the little white highlights go in and it
should<00:05:14.120> be<00:05:14.150> set<00:05:14.540> for<00:05:14.870> clear<00:05:15.080> coat<00:05:15.290> so<00:05:16.090> that's

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
should be set for clear coat so that's

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.870 
should be set for clear coat so that's
pretty<00:05:18.380> much<00:05:18.590> in<00:05:18.920> I'll<00:05:19.130> go<00:05:19.310> back<00:05:19.490> in<00:05:19.700> with<00:05:19.730> a

of the base of the fire to kind of make

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.130 
of the base of the fire to kind of make
it<00:05:25.850> a<00:05:25.970> little<00:05:26.060> bit<00:05:26.240> just<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.540> tad<00:05:26.750> bit<00:05:26.780> hotter
