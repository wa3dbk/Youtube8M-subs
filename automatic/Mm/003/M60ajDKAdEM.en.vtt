00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.720 

basically<00:01:46.650> placing<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.250> block<00:01:47.430> down<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
basically placing the block down the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.660 
basically placing the block down the
third<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.480> for<00:01:49.230> a<00:01:49.260> third<00:01:49.500> click<00:01:50.630> when<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
third time for a third click when that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.450 
third time for a third click when that

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.190 

so<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.700> wasn't<00:02:02.200> laggy<00:02:03.850> that'd<00:02:04.850> be<00:02:04.880> cool<00:02:08.200> so

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
so if I wasn't laggy that'd be cool so

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.070 
so if I wasn't laggy that'd be cool so
there<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.590> go<00:02:09.650> so<00:02:10.640> then<00:02:10.910> you've<00:02:11.060> got<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.930> as

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
there you go so then you've got to so as

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.990 
there you go so then you've got to so as
you<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.320> see<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.830> gotta<00:02:16.360> find<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:19.000> on

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
you can see you just gotta find out on

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.320 
you can see you just gotta find out on
the<00:02:20.900> server<00:02:21.170> what<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:22.090> there<00:02:23.090> I've<00:02:23.270> got

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the server what it is there I've got

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.060 
the server what it is there I've got
four<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:27.080> on<00:02:27.230> some<00:02:27.470> servers<00:02:27.830> you'll<00:02:27.980> be

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
four like on some servers you'll be

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.010 
four like on some servers you'll be
clicking<00:02:28.460> much<00:02:28.640> faster<00:02:29.150> than<00:02:29.270> others<00:02:29.600> here

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
clicking much faster than others here

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:37.590 
clicking much faster than others here
obviously<00:02:30.880> i'm<00:02:31.880> clicking<00:02:32.180> produce<00:02:32.660> low<00:02:36.190> but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
obviously i'm clicking produce low but

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.890 
obviously i'm clicking produce low but
once<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.690> get<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.840> 64<00:02:40.420> obviously<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.570> see<00:02:41.750> i'm

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
once you get to 64 obviously you see i'm

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.610 
once you get to 64 obviously you see i'm
placing<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.740> on<00:02:43.070> top<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:44.450> what<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.170> already<00:02:45.290> was

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
placing it on top of what it already was

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.730 
placing it on top of what it already was
on<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.820> can't<00:02:47.060> place<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.330> stack<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.690> 64<00:02:48.380> on

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
on and you can't place a stack of 64 on

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.620 
on and you can't place a stack of 64 on
the<00:02:48.800> stack<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.580> 64<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:53.120> pretty<00:02:53.330> simple

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
the stack of 64 so it's pretty simple

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.790 
the stack of 64 so it's pretty simple
it'll<00:02:53.990> just<00:02:54.230> I'll<00:02:54.980> get<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:55.640> here<00:02:56.380> but<00:02:57.380> it'll

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
it'll just I'll get it here but it'll

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.360 
it'll just I'll get it here but it'll
just<00:02:58.010> stay<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.600> chest<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.920> your<00:03:01.190> mouse

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
just stay in the chest and in your mouse

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.460 
just stay in the chest and in your mouse
and<00:03:02.530> I'll<00:03:03.530> show<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.770> right<00:03:04.100> now<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:06.230> do

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.680 
and I'll show you right now so you do
the<00:03:06.500> same<00:03:06.770> thing<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.090> it'll<00:03:08.300> stay<00:03:08.480> in

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the same thing and then it'll stay in

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.990 
the same thing and then it'll stay in
the<00:03:08.810> chest<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.500> your<00:03:09.620> mouth<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:10.850> you

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
the chest and in your mouth and then you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
the chest and in your mouth and then you
can<00:03:11.150> get<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.390> going<00:03:11.570> faster<00:03:12.020> by<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:14.020> going

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020
