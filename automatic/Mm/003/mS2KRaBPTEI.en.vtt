playing<00:02:35.640> he<00:02:35.850> was<00:02:35.970> looking<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.330> different<00:02:36.630> way

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
playing he was looking a different way

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.920 
playing he was looking a different way
than<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> song<00:02:37.319> but<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:38.330> guess<00:02:39.330> his<00:02:39.450> control

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
than the song but I guess his control

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.199 
than the song but I guess his control
just<00:02:40.110> moving<00:02:40.470> somehow<00:02:43.760> there<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:44.850> go<00:02:45.000> half

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
just moving somehow there we go half

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.460 
just moving somehow there we go half
time<00:02:45.620> switching<00:02:46.620> sides<00:02:47.810> okay<00:02:48.810> i<00:02:48.840> think<00:02:49.260> i'm

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
time switching sides okay i think i'm

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.860 
time switching sides okay i think i'm
going<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.709> leftover<00:02:50.250> area<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.420> go<00:02:51.600> left

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
going to leftover area I like to go left

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.449 
going to leftover area I like to go left
over<00:02:52.140> here<00:02:52.260> most<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.560> times<00:02:52.830> because<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.340> can

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
over here most of times because you can

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.100

drop<00:02:53.610> your<00:02:53.730> grenade<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.569> right<00:02:54.720> side<00:02:54.959> of

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
