00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.790
 hello youtube good friends today les 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.390
 I will teach how to format your phone 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.820
 Android without entering gay recovery mode 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.470
 Well first things first if 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.300
 you want to format the phone 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:25.750
 sd card with his card as 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:29.150
 they do not take it out because if not the way that 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.890
 sd card as they take it out 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.890
 well then let's start forming 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.220
 and we're going to setup 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.220
 Privacy 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 to reset to defaults and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.890
 format memory card if you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.600
 they want they were formatting up their 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.390
 card erase everything they have 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 because his phone was super mega 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.629
 clean satipo all because they give to both 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.559
 they make the card sd card to clean 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.559
 good 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.689
 and look at everything 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.979
 let's see how quickly we restart the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.290
 phone with all erased as if it 's 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.620
 as if it were leaving the factory 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.620
 very well 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:27.810
 Well, until now, we are going well 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.810
 let's see that it does not come out it is but wolf 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.600
 we see that here begins to erase everything 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.280
 I recommend that you do not change the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.500
 operating system because if they change it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 The operating system 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.550
 there are many times that it fails if it does not accept 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.940
 the cell the operating system and that 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.520
 It does if you if not only guarantee 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.359
 they are accepted for nothing 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.380
 if we came from experience and the other 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.500
 it happened to me 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.050
 I had to buy other units that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.730
 Well, here is samsung 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.730
 after this everything follows 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.319
 same if you change the system 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.630
 operative do the same as this video 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.140
 it gets into privacy settings and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.800
 reset defaults only 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.080
 that I recommend that you continue with the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.770
 operating system that has in the other 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.069
 video I will teach you how to update your 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.950
 operating system from your phone very 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.950
 well then do not download anything or anyone 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.980
 those who have the ones that appear in them 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.690
 English or the Spanish fields can 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.200
 change and do language 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.080
 Spanish English Spanish Portuguese and I do not know 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.710
 what 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.710
 well 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.460
 quito 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:19.860
 they can not log in or create 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:24.170
 Well, I just initialize well 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.170
 that this 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.200
 very well here I started we see that says 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.660

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.260
 true forgiveness 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.280
 they give robotics 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.370
 and create session or sign in for forgiveness 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.480
 for that big mistake 200 200 after 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.160
 who have logged in 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.160
 is going to tell them if they want 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.040
 If you want to sync everything 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:46.120
 synchronize 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:50.170
 is to put your facebook or something like that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:55.740
