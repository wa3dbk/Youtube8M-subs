00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
quite easily it's not as hard with the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.630 
quite easily it's not as hard with the
Nexus<00:00:49.260> tablet<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.039> will<00:00:50.190> check<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> out

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
Nexus tablet and we will check it out

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
Nexus tablet and we will check it out
just<00:00:51.300> after<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.079> what's<00:00:52.379> inside<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.309> box

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
just after we see what's inside the box

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
just after we see what's inside the box
also<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.440> course<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
also so we have here of course the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.729 
also so we have here of course the
lightning<00:00:56.340> cable<00:00:56.899> which<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.050> very<00:00:58.260> important

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
lightning cable which is very important

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.810 
lightning cable which is very important
since<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.160> no<00:00:59.190> 30<00:00:59.550> pin<00:00:59.789> connector

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
since there is no 30 pin connector

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 
since there is no 30 pin connector
anymore<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.770> small<00:01:02.070> USB

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
anymore then we have a really small USB

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
anymore then we have a really small USB
adapter<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.049> actually<00:01:04.350> probably

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
adapter and which is actually probably

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
adapter and which is actually probably
the<00:01:04.979> same<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> apple<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the same one as with the apple and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.340 
the same one as with the apple and
iphone<00:01:08.010> 4<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.970> 5<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> generation

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
then we'll check out the differences in

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.980 
then we'll check out the differences in
the<00:01:23.009> design<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> post<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.900> the
