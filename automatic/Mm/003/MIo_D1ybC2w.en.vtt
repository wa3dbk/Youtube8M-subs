00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
it but I don't really mind per se

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
it but I don't really mind per se
besides<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.170> fact<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.610> won't<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
besides the fact that I just won't be a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
besides the fact that I just won't be a
good<00:01:21.090> story<00:01:21.450> Jason<00:01:21.869> Aaron<00:01:22.200> he's<00:01:22.409> been<00:01:22.560> writing

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
good story Jason Aaron he's been writing

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.469 
good story Jason Aaron he's been writing
Thor<00:01:23.130> god<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.369> thunder<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.210> good

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
Thor god of thunder which is really good

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.859 
Thor god of thunder which is really good
he's<00:01:25.170> riding<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.299> character

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
he's riding a you know this character

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.289 
he's riding a you know this character
and<00:01:28.140> Thor<00:01:28.500> comics<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.909> looks<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.090> they're

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and Thor comics so it looks like they're

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.230 
and Thor comics so it looks like they're
replacing<00:01:30.900> Thor<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:32.040> sure<00:01:32.310> how<00:01:33.030> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
replacing Thor now I'm not sure how it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
replacing Thor now I'm not sure how it's
gonna<00:01:33.329> work<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:34.470> didn't<00:01:34.799> think<00:01:34.890> Thor

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
gonna work because I didn't think Thor

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399 
gonna work because I didn't think Thor
was<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> title<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.119> thought<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:36.900> his<00:01:37.079> name

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
was a title I thought that was his name

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
was a title I thought that was his name
which<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.189> why<00:01:38.340> when<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.670> characters<00:01:39.060> pick

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
which is why when other characters pick

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.749 
which is why when other characters pick
up<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> name<00:01:39.659> Thor<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.860> had<00:01:41.009> characters<00:01:41.549> like

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
up the name Thor we had characters like

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
up the name Thor we had characters like
thunder<00:01:42.150> strike<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.110> he<00:01:43.200> became

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
thunder strike you know he became

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
thunder strike you know he became
thunder<00:01:43.770> strike<00:01:44.040> when<00:01:44.220> there's<00:01:44.369> Thor<00:01:44.759> because

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
thunder strike when there's Thor because

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.899 
thunder strike when there's Thor because
Thor<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> title<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.740> much<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.399> his

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
Thor is not a title as much as it is his

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.690 
Thor is not a title as much as it is his
name<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.540> know<00:01:48.659> he's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> deity<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.189> I'm<00:01:50.549> really

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
name you know he's a deity so I'm really

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.420 
name you know he's a deity so I'm really
confused<00:01:51.119> about<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.659> uh<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.920> Angela

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
confused about this uh if it is Angela

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
confused about this uh if it is Angela
on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> LA<00:01:53.850> she<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.240> wouldn't<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:54.540> by<00:01:54.659> Angela

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
on the LA she just wouldn't go by Angela

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.679 
on the LA she just wouldn't go by Angela
I<00:01:55.409> guess<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.189> name<00:01:56.310> Thor<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.729> more<00:01:56.909> popular<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
I guess the name Thor is more popular so
