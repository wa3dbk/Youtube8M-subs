around to the side of the box we can see
right<00:01:37.650> off<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.979> bat<00:01:38.240> UMTS<00:01:39.290> 850<00:01:40.490> 1900<00:01:41.490> those

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
right off the bat UMTS 850 1900 those

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.719 
right off the bat UMTS 850 1900 those
are<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.119> AT&amp;T<00:01:42.689> beds<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.920> thus<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.460> phone

at it get some first impressions again
we've<00:01:51.600> already<00:01:51.840> covered<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.380> phone<00:01:52.619> on

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
we've already covered this phone on

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.200 
we've already covered this phone on
pocket<00:01:53.250> now<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.610> we're<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> cover

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
pocket now so we're not going to cover

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.090 
pocket now so we're not going to cover
it<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.479> depth<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.380> talk<00:01:55.619> about<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it in depth just talk about how it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.330 
it in depth just talk about how it
specifically<00:01:56.670> works<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.750> AT&amp;T<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.740> our<00:01:59.130> guess

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
specifically works on AT&amp;T and our guess

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.819 
specifically works on AT&amp;T and our guess
is<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.549> it'll<00:01:59.820> work<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.240> well<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.829> all

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
is that it'll work very well because all

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.240 
is that it'll work very well because all
you<00:02:01.979> need<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.460> those<00:02:02.759> band

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
you need is those band

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
see a lot of differences the hd2

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.390 
see a lot of differences the hd2
obviously<00:03:01.989> didn't<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.320> kickstand<00:03:02.770> next

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
display of course the AT&amp;T inspire 4G

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.530 
display of course the AT&amp;T inspire 4G
but<00:03:09.430> kind<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.640> have<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> similar<00:03:10.000> shape<00:03:10.299> there

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
but kind of have a similar shape there

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.199 
but kind of have a similar shape there
with<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> rounded<00:03:11.170> edges<00:03:11.970> hd7<00:03:12.970> actually

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
with the rounded edges hd7 actually

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.520 
with the rounded edges hd7 actually
looks<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.480> little<00:03:13.630> bit<00:03:13.810> nicer<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.170> little<00:03:14.320> bit

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
looks a little bit nicer a little bit

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.560 
looks a little bit nicer a little bit
cleaner<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.100> I'd<00:03:15.489> say<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.910> it's<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.299> little

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
cleaner and I'd say it's it's a little

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.720 
cleaner and I'd say it's it's a little
bit<00:03:16.690> thinner<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:18.160> we're<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.430> talk<00:03:18.580> about

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
bit thinner so we're going to talk about

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.880 
bit thinner so we're going to talk about
the<00:03:18.940> hd7<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.720> little<00:03:19.989> bit<00:03:20.140> more<00:03:20.290> again<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.739> is

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
the hd7 a little bit more again this is

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.800 
the hd7 a little bit more again this is
a<00:03:20.980> very<00:03:21.220> rare<00:03:21.519> device<00:03:21.910> because<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.510> can't

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
a very rare device because you can't

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.830 
a very rare device because you can't
really<00:03:23.070> get<00:03:24.070> this<00:03:24.280> phone<00:03:24.549> on<00:03:24.820> AT&amp;T<00:03:25.239> unless<00:03:25.690> you

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
really get this phone on AT&amp;T unless you

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.449 
really get this phone on AT&amp;T unless you
buy<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.080> unlocked<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.830> again<00:03:27.220> for<00:03:27.370> the
