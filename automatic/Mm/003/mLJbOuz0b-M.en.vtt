00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
straight tool I'll go like that go up

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.410 
straight tool I'll go like that go up
like<00:01:46.080> this<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.310> did<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> correctly<00:01:47.880> and

like this and if I did it correctly and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 
like this and if I did it correctly and
connected<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.020> edges<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.070> select<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
connected all edges when you select it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
connected all edges when you select it
it<00:01:51.090> should<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.570> gray<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> middle<00:01:52.530> you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it should go gray in the middle you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
it should go gray in the middle you
should<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> different<00:01:53.610> change<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
should see a different change of the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.980 
should see a different change of the
color<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> edges<00:01:55.920> are<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.280> correctly

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
color if all the edges are not correctly

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.770 
color if all the edges are not correctly
attached<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.740> won't<00:01:58.890> get<00:01:59.189> this

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
attached then you won't get this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.530 
attached then you won't get this
coloring<00:02:00.780> shape<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.909> okay<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.119> let's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
coloring shape here so okay so let's

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.899 
coloring shape here so okay so let's
take<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.049> bad<00:02:04.350> boy<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.729> less

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
take this bad boy and I don't know less

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.880 
take this bad boy and I don't know less
shape<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.659> little<00:02:06.689> bit<00:02:07.049> I'll<00:02:07.470> shape<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
shape it just a little bit I'll shape it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.720 
shape it just a little bit I'll shape it
like<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.509> shape<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:10.070> maybe<00:02:11.070> shape<00:02:11.459> that

going out maybe I'll notice the offset

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.970 
going out maybe I'll notice the offset
button<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.300> sets<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.900> higher<00:03:30.170> lower<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:30.860> I'm

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
button that sets it higher lower but I'm

pretty sweet and it'll basically follow

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.790 
pretty sweet and it'll basically follow
any<00:03:49.820> shape<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.450> can<00:03:50.750> draw<00:03:51.020> which<00:03:51.380> is<00:03:51.530> really
