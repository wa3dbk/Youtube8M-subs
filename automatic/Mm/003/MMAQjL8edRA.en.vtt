the<00:00:14.830> realization<00:00:15.430> that<00:00:15.550> we<00:00:15.700> should<00:00:15.970> turn<00:00:16.359> this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
the realization that we should turn this

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.620 
the realization that we should turn this
into<00:00:16.840> a<00:00:16.990> separate<00:00:17.529> entity<00:00:18.519> didn't<00:00:19.449> come

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
into a separate entity didn't come

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.749 
into a separate entity didn't come
immediately<00:00:20.050> we<00:00:21.039> just<00:00:21.249> wanted<00:00:21.490> to<00:00:21.550> do

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
immediately we just wanted to do

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.040 
immediately we just wanted to do
something<00:00:21.999> together<00:00:22.240> that<00:00:22.449> was<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.689> driving

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
something together that was the driving

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.870 
something together that was the driving
force<00:00:23.169> behind<00:00:23.650> it<00:00:23.919> it<00:00:24.130> became<00:00:24.550> more<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:24.849> more

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
force behind it it became more and more

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.749 
force behind it it became more and more
clear<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:25.300> us<00:00:25.480> that<00:00:25.509> this<00:00:26.320> is<00:00:26.679> neither<00:00:27.249> Robin

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
clear to us that this is neither Robin

clear to us that this is neither Robin
nor<00:00:28.060> example<00:00:28.599> it's<00:00:28.720> something<00:00:29.169> else

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
me for a long time and we started

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.120 
me for a long time and we started
writing<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:41.130> these<00:01:41.580> lyrics<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.210> were<00:01:42.270> about

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
writing on these lyrics that were about

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
writing on these lyrics that were about
that<00:01:44.130> almost<00:01:44.880> physical<00:01:45.330> feeling<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that almost physical feeling of the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
that almost physical feeling of the
finding<00:01:46.320> maybe<00:01:46.770> who<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.160> are<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
finding maybe who you are and what you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
finding maybe who you are and what you
want<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.350> life<00:01:58.640> there's

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
something very fragile about voices that

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.120 
something very fragile about voices that
are<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:02.130> man-made<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.780> metaphor<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.800> you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
are not man-made like a metaphor for you

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
are not man-made like a metaphor for you
know<00:02:05.280> what<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.090> actually<00:02:06.600> human<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
know what is actually human like the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
know what is actually human like the
defects<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> weirdness<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> things

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
defects and the weirdness and the things

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.030 
defects and the weirdness and the things
that<00:02:09.600> don't<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.170> make<00:02:10.440> sense<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.920> how

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
that don't really make sense and how

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.710 
that don't really make sense and how
this<00:02:11.220> machine<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.730> trying<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.270> sound<00:02:12.480> human

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this machine is trying to sound human

this machine is trying to sound human
but<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.260> not<00:02:13.440> really

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.340 

the<00:02:17.430> starting<00:02:17.790> point<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> toy<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:18.840> kids<00:02:19.020> I

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
the starting point is a toy for kids I

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.560 
the starting point is a toy for kids I
can<00:02:19.830> say<00:02:20.040> certain<00:02:20.430> words<00:02:20.460> playing<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
pre-recorded words we can basically make

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.820 
pre-recorded words we can basically make
the<00:02:26.820> robot<00:02:27.120> say<00:02:27.330> things<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:28.050> shouldn't<00:02:28.350> say<00:02:28.590> we

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
the robot say things it shouldn't say we

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.940 
the robot say things it shouldn't say we
do<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> fascination<00:02:30.210> for<00:02:30.420> technology<00:02:31.260> we

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
do have a fascination for technology we

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.370 
do have a fascination for technology we
love<00:02:32.190> sci-fi<00:02:32.580> movies<00:02:33.150> when<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:33.840> kids<00:02:34.080> in

said it accidental pop song and I think

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.220

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.000 

it's<00:03:51.760> an<00:03:51.910> old<00:03:52.090> thing<00:03:52.390> old<00:03:53.050> but<00:03:53.380> one<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.920> the
