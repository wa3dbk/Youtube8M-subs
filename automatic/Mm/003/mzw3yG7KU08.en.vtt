professionals that we are no less I even

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.450 
professionals that we are no less I even
have<00:00:52.630> a<00:00:52.660> click<00:00:52.960> tip<00:00:53.140> of<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.500> day<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.890> am<00:00:54.190> sure

you<00:00:54.640> will<00:00:54.700> all<00:00:54.850> like<00:00:55.150> it

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.810 

what<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.990> so<00:01:04.350> let's<00:01:05.100> understand<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:05.730> very

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
what is I so let's understand and very

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.300 
what is I so let's understand and very
simple<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> easy<00:01:06.690> language<00:01:07.100> ISO<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
simple and easy language ISO is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
simple and easy language ISO is
basically<00:01:08.790> magnification<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> light<00:01:10.200> hitting

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
basically magnification of light hitting

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.760 
basically magnification of light hitting
on<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.160> sensor<00:01:11.660> boosting<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:12.810> ISO<00:01:13.320> means

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
on the sensor boosting the ISO means

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.400 
on the sensor boosting the ISO means
more<00:01:14.100> magnification<00:01:14.660> making<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.810> image<00:01:16.140> look

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
more magnification making the image look

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.410 
more magnification making the image look
brighter<00:01:18.710> still<00:01:19.710> confused<00:01:20.310> let's<00:01:20.820> understand

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
brighter still confused let's understand

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
brighter still confused let's understand
is<00:01:21.600> by<00:01:21.780> seeing<00:01:22.050> few<00:01:22.320> examples<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> images

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
is by seeing few examples of images

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.190 
is by seeing few examples of images
which<00:01:23.910> will<00:01:24.090> clear<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.750> doubts<00:01:24.810> about

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
which will clear all your doubts about

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
which will clear all your doubts about
it<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.280> clicking<00:01:26.700> images<00:01:27.240> with

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
it we will be clicking images with

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.950 
it we will be clicking images with
different<00:01:27.750> ISO<00:01:28.620> values<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.520> darkroom

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
different ISO values in a darkroom

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.750 
different ISO values in a darkroom
keeping<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> dots<00:01:31.410> in<00:01:31.680> front<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.310> camera

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
keeping the dots in front of the camera

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.990 
keeping the dots in front of the camera
to<00:01:33.120> understand<00:01:33.690> ISO<00:01:34.229> perfectly<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.790> can

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to understand ISO perfectly as you can

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
to understand ISO perfectly as you can
see<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.750> torchlight<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.590> used<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.040> get

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
see the torchlight are used to get

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.749 
see the torchlight are used to get
brighter<00:01:38.580> as<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.450> ISO<00:01:39.960> value<00:01:40.290> increases<00:01:41.040> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
brighter as the ISO value increases but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.030 
brighter as the ISO value increases but
it<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> camera<00:01:42.900> sensor<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.979> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it is the camera sensor that is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
it is the camera sensor that is
magnifying<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> light<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.810> torch<00:01:46.080> light

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
magnifying the light the torch light

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
magnifying the light the torch light
remains<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> same<00:01:47.220> ISO<00:01:48.119> has<00:01:48.300> its<00:01:48.570> own

remains the same ISO has its own

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.719 
remains the same ISO has its own
advantages<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.619> disadvantages

the<00:01:51.330> advantage<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.930> ISO<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.100> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the advantage of ISO is that when you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.090 
the advantage of ISO is that when you
boost<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.759> ISO<00:01:54.150> from<00:01:54.360> 100<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.900> 200<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.500> 400

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
boost up your ISO from 100 to 200 to 400

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
boost up your ISO from 100 to 200 to 400
we<00:01:56.520> are<00:01:56.580> able<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.270> brighter<00:01:57.600> images<00:01:58.020> in

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
we are able to take brighter images in

we are able to take brighter images in
low<00:01:58.380> light<00:01:58.590> conditions<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.450> disadvantage<00:02:00.450> of

low light conditions the disadvantage of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.719 
low light conditions the disadvantage of
it<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.410> you<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.340> start<00:02:02.399> getting

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it is when you do that you start getting

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.330 
it is when you do that you start getting
grainy<00:02:03.240> images<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.140> texture<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.130> would

grainy images the texture that you would
