longer<00:01:39.770> hair<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:40.070> can<00:01:40.189> use<00:01:40.220> one<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.460> these

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
longer hair you can use one of these

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.330 
longer hair you can use one of these
rounded<00:01:40.970> brushes<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:42.229> like<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.740> don't<00:01:43.220> know

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
rounded brushes and like I don't know

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.469 
rounded brushes and like I don't know
how<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.460> do<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.670> because<00:01:43.729> my<00:01:43.909> hair<00:01:44.060> shorter<00:01:44.360> but

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
how to do it because my hair shorter but

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.030 
how to do it because my hair shorter but
like<00:01:44.630> then<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:44.869> go<00:01:44.960> like<00:01:45.080> this<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.439> then<00:01:45.560> the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
like then you go like this and then the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.010 
like then you go like this and then the
hairdresser<00:01:46.400> they<00:01:46.520> blow<00:01:46.729> down<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:47.990> that

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
hairdresser they blow down and so that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.630 
hairdresser they blow down and so that
pretty<00:01:48.440> much<00:01:48.500> stronger<00:01:48.860> hair<00:01:49.159> straight<00:01:49.460> so

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
pretty much stronger hair straight so

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.980 
pretty much stronger hair straight so
you<00:01:49.700> don't<00:01:49.880> have<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.150> use<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> nice

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
you don't have to use a nice

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.170 
you don't have to use a nice
straightening<00:01:51.890> irons<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.610> use<00:01:52.790> more<00:01:53.000> heat

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
straightening irons and use more heat

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.639

and<00:01:53.210> damage<00:01:53.630> your<00:01:53.659> hair<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.200> if<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.470> can<00:01:54.590> just

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and damage your hair so if you can just

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:55.950 
and damage your hair so if you can just
we<00:01:54.830> do<00:01:54.890> my<00:01:55.040> own<00:01:55.250> step<00:01:55.490> would<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.759> much<00:01:55.909> faster

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
we do my own step would be much faster

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.850 
we do my own step would be much faster
afterwards<00:01:56.960> just<00:01:57.080> want<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.380> comb<00:01:57.590> out<00:01:57.710> your

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
afterwards just want to comb out your

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.090 
afterwards just want to comb out your
