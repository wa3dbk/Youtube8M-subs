Oslo<00:00:59.820> was<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.449> therefore<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.289> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
Oslo was because therefore a lot of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
Oslo was because therefore a lot of
courses<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.800> virology<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
courses in virology and that is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
courses in virology and that is
something<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.080> definitely<00:01:04.920> can't

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
something that you definitely can't

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.520 
something that you definitely can't
study<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.150> Spain<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.439> are

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
study in Spain I don't think there are

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.420 
study in Spain I don't think there are
courses<00:01:07.799> anywhere

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
courses anywhere

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.570 
courses anywhere
and<00:01:09.110> very<00:01:10.110> few<00:01:10.439> other<00:01:10.590> places<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.070> Europe<00:01:11.220> too

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and very few other places in Europe too

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.560 
and very few other places in Europe too
so<00:01:12.560> there<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> lot<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.890> extra<00:01:14.310> expertise<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so there is a lot of extra expertise in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.190 
so there is a lot of extra expertise in
virology<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:17.299> studying<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.509> Oslo<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.960> really

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
virology here studying in Oslo is really

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
virology here studying in Oslo is really
