00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
alright guys this is a quick tutorial on

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.120 
alright guys this is a quick tutorial on
how<00:00:12.590> to<00:00:13.450> create<00:00:14.450> multiple<00:00:14.690> materials<00:00:15.320> for

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
how to create multiple materials for

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.370 
how to create multiple materials for
your<00:00:16.279> character<00:00:16.760> this<00:00:17.660> is<00:00:17.810> especially<00:00:18.140> useful

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
your character this is especially useful

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.490 
your character this is especially useful
if<00:00:18.920> you're<00:00:19.040> creating<00:00:19.550> a<00:00:20.500> customizable

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
if you're creating a customizable

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.260 
if you're creating a customizable
character<00:00:21.680> for<00:00:22.189> your<00:00:22.310> unity<00:00:22.760> game<00:00:22.970> or<00:00:23.240> a

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
character for your unity game or a

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.760 
character for your unity game or a
blender<00:00:23.570> game<00:00:23.750> or<00:00:24.760> UDK<00:00:25.760> game<00:00:26.029> I<00:00:26.300> guess<00:00:26.840> I'm<00:00:27.650> not

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
blender game or UDK game I guess I'm not

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.689 
blender game or UDK game I guess I'm not
sure<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:29.140> would<00:00:30.140> check<00:00:30.440> out<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.619> FAQs<00:00:30.920> but

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
sure I would check out the FAQs but

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.020 
sure I would check out the FAQs but
anyways<00:00:32.029> um<00:00:32.300> I<00:00:33.430> already<00:00:34.430> got<00:00:34.640> like<00:00:34.850> a<00:00:34.879> little

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
anyways um I already got like a little

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.670 
anyways um I already got like a little
setup<00:00:35.360> going<00:00:35.629> because<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:36.230> kind<00:00:36.470> of<00:00:36.500> already

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
setup going because I kind of already

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.319 
setup going because I kind of already
did<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.949> video<00:00:37.100> for<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:37.670> but<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:39.320> didn't<00:00:40.329> go

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
did a video for it but it didn't go

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.910 
did a video for it but it didn't go
right<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.670> this<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.730> another<00:00:43.880> video<00:00:47.920> extremely

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
right so this is another video extremely

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.369 
right so this is another video extremely
tired<00:00:49.450> alright<00:00:50.450> so<00:00:50.690> I<00:00:50.719> have<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.170> character<00:00:51.969> I

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
tired alright so I have the character I

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.959 
tired alright so I have the character I
applied<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.680> material<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.370> arm<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.850> way

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
applied the material to the arm the way

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.940 
applied the material to the arm the way
I<00:00:56.000> did<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.329> was<00:00:56.390> I<00:00:56.629> selected<00:00:57.140> every<00:00:57.680> single

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
I did that was I selected every single

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.010 
I did that was I selected every single
vertices<00:00:58.340> that<00:00:58.370> I<00:00:58.550> could<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.570> wanted<00:00:59.899> to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
vertices that I could that I wanted to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.540 
vertices that I could that I wanted to
be<00:01:00.170> dissever<00:01:00.770> material<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:02.210> went<00:01:02.570> over<00:01:02.809> and

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
be dissever material and I went over and

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.050 
be dissever material and I went over and
I<00:01:05.080> put<00:01:06.080> I<00:01:06.670> made<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> new<00:01:08.180> material<00:01:08.869> with<00:01:09.080> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
I put I made a new material with the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.779 
I put I made a new material with the
positive<00:01:11.140> plus<00:01:12.140> sign<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:13.300> then<00:01:14.300> I<00:01:14.390> assigned<00:01:14.840> I

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
positive plus sign and then I assigned I

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.639 
positive plus sign and then I assigned I
signed<00:01:16.789> all<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.300> these<00:01:17.720> vertices<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.500> that

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
signed all of these vertices to that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.910 
signed all of these vertices to that
material<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:19.640> as<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.060> can<00:01:20.209> see<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.539> can

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
material and now as you can see you can

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.730 
material and now as you can see you can
increase<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:24.130> light<00:01:25.130> or<00:01:25.160> dark<00:01:25.550> depending

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
increase it light or dark depending

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.279 
increase it light or dark depending
specularity<00:01:27.740> if<00:01:28.610> it's<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.179> piece<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.509> armor<00:01:32.289> and

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
specularity if it's a piece of armor and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.230 
specularity if it's a piece of armor and
whatnot<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:36.530> rest<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.920> them<00:01:37.240> is

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
whatnot and the rest of them is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.670 
whatnot and the rest of them is
basically<00:01:40.420> another<00:01:41.420> material

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.620 

all<00:01:46.250> right<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.740> after<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.800> did<00:01:48.890> all<00:01:49.010> that

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
all right so after I did all that

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.150 
all right so after I did all that
basically<00:01:50.630> what<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.810> did<00:01:50.930> was<00:01:51.230> I<00:01:51.380> went<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.710> and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
basically what I did was I went in and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.050 
basically what I did was I went in and
made<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.880> UV<00:01:53.510> seem<00:01:56.200> as<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:57.530> see<00:01:57.770> here<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.430> I

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
made a UV seem as you can see here and I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.880 
made a UV seem as you can see here and I
selected<00:01:59.480> all<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.990> vertices<00:02:00.260> that<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.650> wanted

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
selected all the vertices that I wanted

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.580 
selected all the vertices that I wanted
to<00:02:00.950> be<00:02:01.250> unwrapped<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.660> unwrapped<00:02:03.080> them<00:02:03.290> in

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
to be unwrapped and I unwrapped them in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.680 
to be unwrapped and I unwrapped them in
the<00:02:04.010> UV<00:02:04.280> editing<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.030> can<00:02:05.090> see<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.510> is<00:02:05.660> just

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
the UV editing you can see this is just

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.490 
the UV editing you can see this is just
his<00:02:05.990> arm

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
his arm

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.880 
his arm
that's<00:02:06.740> unwrapped<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:09.500> will<00:02:09.710> actually

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
that's unwrapped and this will actually

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.800 
that's unwrapped and this will actually
be<00:02:10.100> assigned<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.850> material<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:14.150> you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
be assigned to that material if you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
be assigned to that material if you
bring<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.590> into<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.950> texture<00:02:16.310> editor<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:18.590> not

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
bring it into the texture editor or not

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.820 
bring it into the texture editor or not
the<00:02:18.950> texture<00:02:19.220> editor<00:02:19.340> but<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.830> assigning

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the texture editor but the assigning

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.060 
the texture editor but the assigning
textures<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> material<00:02:23.750> will<00:02:24.740> actually

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
textures to the material will actually

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.120 
textures to the material will actually
be<00:02:25.250> on<00:02:25.490> there<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.500> I'll<00:02:27.500> show<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.770> what<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
be on there and I'll show you what it

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.430 
be on there and I'll show you what it
does<00:02:30.040> basically<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.970> already<00:02:32.390> did<00:02:33.050> all<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
does basically I already did all of the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.920 
does basically I already did all of the
unwrapping<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> character<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.750> went

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
unwrapping for the character and I went

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.500 
unwrapping for the character and I went
over<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.320> textures<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.370> assigned<00:02:38.360> a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
over to the textures and assigned a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.620 
over to the textures and assigned a
texture<00:02:38.990> image<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.910> course<00:02:43.240> what<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:44.360> want<00:02:44.510> to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
texture image of course what you want to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.590 
texture image of course what you want to
do<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:44.990> want<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> open<00:02:46.330> go<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.390> wherever

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
do is you want to open go to wherever

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.430 
do is you want to open go to wherever
you<00:02:47.720> save<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.080> image<00:02:48.580> its<00:02:49.580> title<00:02:50.390> -<00:02:50.600> it's<00:02:51.230> all

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
you save the image its title - it's all

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.520 
you save the image its title - it's all
black<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:52.360> colored<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.510> all<00:02:53.600> black<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:56.530> you

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
black I colored it all black and you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.330 
black I colored it all black and you
want<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.769> go<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.090> material<00:02:59.090> one<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.100> just<00:03:01.100> sign

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
want to go to material one and just sign

here tab add some lights
maybe<00:03:44.209> intensity<00:03:44.840> increase<00:03:45.200> intense<00:03:46.069> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
maybe intensity increase intense the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.550 
maybe intensity increase intense the
energy<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:49.130> turn<00:03:49.489> into<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.790> Sun<00:03:50.560> and
