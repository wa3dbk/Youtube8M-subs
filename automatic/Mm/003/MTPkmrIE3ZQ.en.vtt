00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.740
 most of them suffice, say 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
 normal car to get from a to b 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.900
 but there are also super athletes on the 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.230
 the streets are wide and deep 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.939
 So why do most of them do it ? 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 for the sake of appearance, one needs one 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 first a sportier fell one 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.570
 bigger cases 17 18 inches 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.879
 then the tires are also flatter like 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.040
 Here you can see this athletic advice 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.650
 much flatter than the standard advice 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
 as the old wheel and you become this now 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.330
 athletic advice to the car so you can see 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.879
 that the gap between mature and 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.570
 Body becomes bigger here you need 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.220
 now a sports suspension of the athletes 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.960
 So it is lower has a sports suspension 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.970
 as the two come up to see 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.890
 but there are also differences if 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.659
 you should know what you want or 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.089
 needs now, for example, a 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.850
 series shock absorbers with a series 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.710
 feather and goal it is the vehicle 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.350
 lower and many do in 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.370
 the few that spring simply cut the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.980
 but it is forbidden 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.860
 is better such a solution a 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.780
 complete landing gear the vehicle has one 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 certain altitude and gas pressure 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.980
 Shock absorber is accordingly with the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.450
 spring set on the vehicle and 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.700
 for the sporty ambitious driver 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.800
 Of course there is this solution here 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.410
 you still bring that through a woman 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.659
 adjust the height of the chassis and also 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.090
 the damper with hardness accordingly 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.300
 to adjust 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.740
 cost 600 to 1200 euro in 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.600
 there are two bilstein bumpers 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.159
 one with gas and the other with oil 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 filled the whole is going through 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 the trend piston this is this 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 Contribution are here with the damper in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.330
 the herd can be adjusted 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.100
 and here are the benefits she has freely read 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.930
 the advantages of wide tires 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.220
 I have a better braking effect and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.470
 can be a bit faster in the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.970
 Bends drive as you are here very nice 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.610
 the vehicle looks deeper now 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.010
 placed by that is the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 The center of gravity is the lower one 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.759
 I have no bank and roll more 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.489
 that is a very sporty overall 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.709
 vote is less daring 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.569
 that the ride comfort a bit 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.319
 Lost by the tight chassis 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.430
 and by the flags 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.079
 help with so many benefits 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.450
 some perhaps from thrift then 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:29.170
 yourself to the tool without expertise 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.939
 But that can be the topic 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.189
 Chassis is a very complex topic 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.450
 that's why my tip let a few 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.920
 more basically in one 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.889
 workshop by a skilled person with a 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.150
 tree track crash must follow 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.980
 be controlled and it must 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.230
 be registered to a last tip 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.000
 when you go on a big trip 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.590
 Practice the driving behavior first 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.450
 it should change seriously 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.060
 everyone should be aware of which 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.829
 landing gear for him comes in consultation 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.480
 There is also in specialized workshops that is 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.489
 Necessary not to bad 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.110
 streets with a rebberg the 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.260
 to strain the spine 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.260
 keep me
