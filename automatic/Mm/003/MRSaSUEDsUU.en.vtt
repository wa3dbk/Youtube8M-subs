00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:12.929
 here and set up here as well we see the first 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.610
 channel it means that this meander with gas 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.260
 he 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.260
 increase your time open up 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.169
 it means the first nozzle is connected 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:33.489
 yellow accordingly it jumps with us 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:35.970
 lambda probe means hours turn on mode 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.970
 accumulation 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 reduces this umbrella there 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.320
 I will turn off the treatment now 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:02.530
 Well here itâ€™s hard to see me here it does not give 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:12.550
 expand starts crap so here 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:15.480
 let's see it jumps from the place here it is 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.490
 here and there goes here and there i have it 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.740
 lambda probe it directly controls 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.310
 nozzle opening time even on 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.310
 Idling 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.010
 for example a rich mixture 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.470
 Often a rich mix jumped 5 when 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.020
 it increases with vice versa decreases 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.480
 opening time poor mix she 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.480
 increases and back and forth so jumps 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 included 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.979
 but the fact that 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.300
 qnet 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.410
 vodka jump once did not ask once and 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.780
 up and at this time here is very little 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.710
 little distance it is practically not 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.190
 visible poor mix he increased rich 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.240
 Well, less back and forth 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.240
 all all work 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 thanks for watching all the best
