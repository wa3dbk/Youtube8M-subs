00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.900
 she has a measured center where she came from right there 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.749
 martínez is the CEO of nascar digital 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.589
 and we're going to talk about how all that 3d technology is revolutionizing the 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.319
 business world and welcome as happened to Carlos as these agassa 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:32.760
 indigenous people of the entity 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.530
 the headquarters of the company that has three lines of business one of them is 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.660
 the hucacion where 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.510
 We train people to follow the world 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.850
 any since exactly to design to diagram make all technology 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.319
 sensibly another that this technology is to say 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.530
 we involve digital tools 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.450
 on television channels in advertising agencies in 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.840
 it's people who need 3d for part of their processes and 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.180
 and the third we make products focused on the international part, let's look at them 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.300
 harlequin and what are those applications that 3d is having in 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.710
 the world of business 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.060
 Well right now it's very interesting because this one 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.360
 percent the 3d is something like the time the internet began to enter 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 to all companies to change business models then 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.640
 likewise all this 3d digital technology is entering 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.300
 not only to common spaces like the cinema 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.970
 in video games it's police things that where it's commonly 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.240
 but now all the companies are 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.520
 where you can simulate processes you no longer have to carry your model for example 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.490
 to a wind tunnel but you do it digital then they are low costs 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.030
 the lp 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.080
 It is proven that when you get into a process, install the companies you are 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.000
 saving 40% of the costs that if really quite high 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.960
 I am struck by the limit you fall before leaving with the company 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.979
 settled the investigation and Canada and the United States because 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.300
 yes for a hundred we realized let's say that within the philosophy of the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.400
 company, the idea is that it is very international, let's say it from 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.810
 Before the beginning 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.479
 that we have to investigate very well as you notice the companies out the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.729
 who are leaders 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.019
 start with a process and end with a final product 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.319
 and in this 3d story we did an investigation for four years in 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.590
 very important companies for example in cinema in gringo rex zenimax works 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.990
 per cent of those who fled after narrow form 13 after those who do saw 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.810
 flights as 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.069
 and electronic ubisoft 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.150
 e in digital architecture in industrial design and so on and so on 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.209
 and we detect the processes that they have to have a final product 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.989
 clear and on that we set up a workflow and all of our 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.379
 let's say our products our courses 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.740
 the way we implement in companies 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.260
 we make them under standards under those international standards was very 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.280
 Interesting 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.020
 in the case of the personnel, it is as a trainer that you are 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.170
 training but who is interested in the subject 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.399
 the country almost sme to the impression or not 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:01.150
 really this is very new 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.309
 true i percent 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.329
 both businessmen 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.209
 like the let's say the clos esta pse-ee mental horns 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.779
 are realizing that this is one of the great opportunities even the 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.689
 National government 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.359
 placed this tale of 3d and animation inside one of the 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.460
 assumptions hussein most important lines of future development 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.760
 that within the tics 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.049
 already then this efe this is a cube and a really business opportunity 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.379
 3D world moves a lot of money out in series in videogames 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.479
 and sent games that are not only fun but are also 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.339
 for example to train for academic business actions 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.129
 trainings on different topics 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.219
 for example ed we develop a product 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.990
 queen the pedagogical bases 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.450
 if it is to say all that weighs on the tunnel dating 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.970
 that people are cooperative then developed a percent the the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.039
 competencies that wants to develop events in its employees 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.250
 and on that you mount a video game 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.510
 that had reports tell the director or the head of human resources 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.480
 i the agent in his house what he plays 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.699
 has fun connects by e 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.709
 the with the other companions 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.449
 but really below what you are is achieving some skills in 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.370
 that person and you can see how cooperative he found so much 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.379
 person to another 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.189
 then not only for example my game is entertainment but 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.099
 as well 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.860
 is part or can be part 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.860
 d percent the new forms of training for 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.550
 and I would like you to explain us very well and the theory will not be extended 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.650
 according to 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.759
 in this world of 3d you are going to generate many business opportunities for 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.809
 different areas 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.999
 look what they understand for example 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.020
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.499
 like these international models 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:56.740
 of business have changed 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.220
 many of the companies are migrating part of their productions 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.460
 to places where the costs are not very high 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.620
 or have a common day of innovation level 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.939
 I had the movies for example that they take out one after another saga 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.379
 because you really need more ideas that reach people 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.100
 and that's really a business opportunity where we 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.480
 we no longer have to leave here for example to the pxc family for beech 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.840
 they locked apple and strained in a video game 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.130
 puebla prey of isend ustea the outside 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.530
 if not you can raise the placid from here locally 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.680
 send them for example 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.860
 on the internet under some schemes that they come standards that already have 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.919
 and an idea of ​​yours can be placed on bonds the standards send them online and 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.470
 you can hire part 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.220
 the work that you do l is what activated also super carpio 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.879
 interesting 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.680
 how is the profile has someone who wants to work in 3d conditions 

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:54.460
 requirements to gather 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.360
 basically for one hundred 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.319
 it must be the person who likes the story 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.990
 yes yes yes if you like something and you are passionate 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.839
 you just have to get on the road because 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:12.360
 is let's say he trains the tools 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.719
 By the way, this is already here and technology is becoming cheaper 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.199
 the same as you have and you buy or innocent king is the same as 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:21.909
 do you have 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.099
 that is using a person I did not feel char 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.410
 it really is not anymore 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.740
 Technology is not an apology 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.199
 neither the information is an apology, it's already on the way and I really want it and 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:35.930
 ready 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.889
 has many times for having accepted the rats invitation with us here 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.939
 sharing this interesting topic 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:43.939
 of 3d animation because the context of the invitations 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.699
 expte 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.699
