00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
much cheaper than a new one so I figured

touch screen is while I was scrolling

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.230 
touch screen is while I was scrolling
the<00:05:51.280> wrong<00:05:51.550> way<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:55.360> touch<00:05:56.080> pad<00:05:57.240> isn't

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
perfect it does leave a little to be

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.920 
perfect it does leave a little to be
desired<00:06:00.010> and<00:06:01.020> responsiveness<00:06:02.020> but<00:06:02.560> I<00:06:03.930> was

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
desired and responsiveness but I was

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.560 
desired and responsiveness but I was
scrolling<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.440> wrong<00:06:05.680> way<00:06:05.890> just<00:06:06.540> thought<00:06:07.540> I

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
scrolling the wrong way just thought I

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.600 
scrolling the wrong way just thought I
better<00:06:07.810> correct<00:06:08.169> that<00:06:08.820> but<00:06:09.930> swiping<00:06:10.930> across

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
better correct that but swiping across

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.580 
better correct that but swiping across
there<00:06:12.610> brings<00:06:13.360> up<00:06:13.539> the<00:06:13.660> charms<00:06:13.990> menu<00:06:14.080> just

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
there brings up the charms menu just

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.710 
there brings up the charms menu just
like
