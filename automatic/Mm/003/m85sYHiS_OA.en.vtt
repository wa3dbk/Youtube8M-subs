00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
learn to play this way although that's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.490 
learn to play this way although that's
not<00:00:35.040> natural<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.810> you'll<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.470> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
not natural for them but you'll see a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.840 
not natural for them but you'll see a
lot<00:00:37.560> of<00:00:37.770> left-handed<00:00:38.190> players<00:00:38.400> playing<00:00:38.730> the

lot of left-handed players playing the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.280 
lot of left-handed players playing the
guitar<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.360> way<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
guitar this way which is kind of the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.320 
guitar this way which is kind of the
reverse<00:00:40.440> now<00:00:41.400> this<00:00:41.580> feels<00:00:41.820> incredibly

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
reverse now this feels incredibly

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.910 
reverse now this feels incredibly
awkward<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.930> me<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.410> I've<00:00:43.560> been<00:00:43.590> playing

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
awkward for me because I've been playing

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.790 
awkward for me because I've been playing
it<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> other<00:00:44.280> way<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.490> so<00:00:44.790> many<00:00:44.910> years

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
it the other way for so many years

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.690 
it the other way for so many years
however<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:46.980> you're<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.280> starting<00:00:47.490> off

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
however if you're just starting off

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.390 
however if you're just starting off
playing<00:00:48.060> there's<00:00:48.330> nothing<00:00:48.750> wrong<00:00:48.930> with

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
playing there's nothing wrong with

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.710 
playing there's nothing wrong with
learning<00:00:50.400> to<00:00:50.610> play<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.790> guitar<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.330> way<00:00:51.480> in

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
learning to play the guitar this way in

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.930 
learning to play the guitar this way in
fact<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.230> probably<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.310> natural<00:00:53.580> as

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
fact it's probably just as natural as

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.920 
fact it's probably just as natural as
the<00:00:54.090> other<00:00:54.210> way<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.020> only<00:00:55.200> difference<00:00:55.820> is<00:00:56.930> one

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the other way the only difference is one

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.420 
the other way the only difference is one
thing<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.200> keep<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.470> mind<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.040> strings

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
thing to keep in mind is your strings

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.770 
thing to keep in mind is your strings
are<00:00:59.490> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.760> backwards<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.630> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
are going to be backwards so this is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
are going to be backwards so this is
actually<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.260> highest<00:01:01.620> note<00:01:01.830> and<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
actually your highest note and this is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
actually your highest note and this is
your<00:01:02.910> lowest<00:01:03.240> note<00:01:03.619> high<00:01:04.619> string<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.339> low

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
your lowest note high string and low

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.429 
your lowest note high string and low
string<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.540> they're<00:01:06.750> they're<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
string so they're they're kind of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.590 
string so they're they're kind of
reversed<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.240> starting<00:01:09.420> off

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
reversed but if you're just starting off

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
reversed but if you're just starting off
playing<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.440> can<00:01:10.620> learn<00:01:10.800> it<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.040> way<00:01:11.190> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
playing you can learn it that way just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460 
playing you can learn it that way just
as<00:01:11.580> easy<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.120> other<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> there's<00:01:13.260> some

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
as easy as the other and there's some

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
as easy as the other and there's some
great<00:01:13.680> left-handed<00:01:14.670> guitar<00:01:15.030> players<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.360> do

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
great left-handed guitar players that do

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.430 
great left-handed guitar players that do
play<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.550> Jimi<00:01:17.550> Hendrix<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.440> and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
play it that way Jimi Hendrix is one and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.580 
play it that way Jimi Hendrix is one and
Paul<00:01:20.040> McCartney<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.820> comes<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.180> mind

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
Paul McCartney is one that comes to mind

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
Paul McCartney is one that comes to mind
I<00:01:23.180> remember<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.510> just<00:01:24.780> starting<00:01:25.080> off

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I remember when I was just starting off

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.170 
I remember when I was just starting off
playing<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.040> natural<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.550> for<00:01:26.790> me<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> want

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
playing the natural way for me to want

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
playing the natural way for me to want
to<00:01:27.270> hold<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> guitar<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to hold the guitar was like this so I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.890 
to hold the guitar was like this so I
could<00:01:29.580> kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.000> what's<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
could kind of see what's going on you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.270 
could kind of see what's going on you
get<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.080> bird's<00:01:31.380> eye<00:01:31.500> view<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.010> hold<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
get a bird's eye view when you hold it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.750 
get a bird's eye view when you hold it
this<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.270> problem<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
this way the problem with that is that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.430 
this way the problem with that is that
you<00:01:35.760> end<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.000> having<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.510> of<00:01:36.570> Crane<00:01:37.409> your

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
you end up having to kind of Crane your

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.010 
you end up having to kind of Crane your
hand<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:39.000> make<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> chords<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
hand and to make the chords and the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.130 
hand and to make the chords and the
notes<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:41.190> isn't<00:01:41.690> which<00:01:42.690> actually<00:01:42.960> makes

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
notes which isn't which actually makes

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
notes which isn't which actually makes
playing<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.500> lot<00:01:43.620> more<00:01:43.770> difficult<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> would

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
playing a lot more difficult so I would

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.660 
playing a lot more difficult so I would
recommend<00:01:45.110> you're<00:01:46.110> starting<00:01:46.500> off<00:01:46.650> put<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

of playing on electric guitar electric

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.149 
of playing on electric guitar electric
guitars<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.420> often<00:02:07.080> much<00:02:07.409> thinner<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.979> well

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
guitars are often much thinner as well

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.820 
guitars are often much thinner as well
but<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.299> same<00:02:09.509> principle<00:02:09.959> applies<00:02:10.229> push<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
but the same principle applies push the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.640 
but the same principle applies push the
back<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> guitar<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:12.209> against<00:02:12.599> your<00:02:13.170> torso

so<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> beginning<00:02:15.240> you're<00:02:15.510> probably

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so in the beginning you're probably

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.590 
so in the beginning you're probably
going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.170> doing<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> lot<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.160> know

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
going to be doing a lot of you know

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.240 
going to be doing a lot of you know
graining<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.200> see<00:02:18.380> what's<00:02:18.560> going<00:02:18.770> on<00:02:18.950> over

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
graining to see what's going on over

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.700 
graining to see what's going on over
here<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:19.550> that's<00:02:19.670> okay<00:02:20.140> as<00:02:21.140> long<00:02:21.380> as<00:02:21.440> the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
here but that's okay as long as the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.520 
here but that's okay as long as the
guitar<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.130> held<00:02:22.400> properly<00:02:23.230> there's<00:02:24.230> nothing

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
guitar is held properly there's nothing

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.980 
guitar is held properly there's nothing
wrong<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:24.680> craning<00:02:25.220> your<00:02:25.250> neck<00:02:25.370> like<00:02:25.730> that

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
wrong with craning your neck like that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.540 
wrong with craning your neck like that
one<00:02:26.990> other<00:02:27.140> thing<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> point<00:02:27.710> out<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:27.920> these

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
one other thing to point out is these

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.360 
one other thing to point out is these
little<00:02:28.880> dots<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:29.750> see<00:02:29.900> up<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.440> down<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
little dots that you see up and down the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.280 
little dots that you see up and down the
fretboard<00:02:31.940> those<00:02:32.300> are<00:02:32.420> called<00:02:32.600> fret<00:02:32.870> markers

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
fretboard those are called fret markers

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.020 
fretboard those are called fret markers
and<00:02:33.890> those<00:02:34.070> are<00:02:34.220> just<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> reference

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and those are just there as a reference

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.210 
and those are just there as a reference
so<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.720> can<00:02:35.930> quickly<00:02:36.620> know<00:02:37.010> where

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
so that you can quickly know where

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.090 
so that you can quickly know where
you're<00:02:37.340> at<00:02:37.490> on<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.760> fretboard<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.650> know<00:02:39.830> if

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
you're at on the fretboard so I know if

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.470 
you're at on the fretboard so I know if
I<00:02:40.220> need<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.460> play<00:02:40.580> in<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.760> seventh<00:02:41.060> fret<00:02:41.240> I'm

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
I need to play in the seventh fret I'm

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.070 
I need to play in the seventh fret I'm
right<00:02:41.690> here

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
right here

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.720 
right here
you<00:02:42.260> know<00:02:42.350> it's<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> third<00:02:42.800> dot<00:02:43.010> -<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.550> great

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
you know it's the third dot - so great

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.530 
you know it's the third dot - so great
you'll<00:02:44.120> start<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.450> learn<00:02:44.630> these<00:02:44.840> things<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you'll start to learn these things and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.480 
you'll start to learn these things and
when<00:02:47.540> I'm<00:02:47.690> playing<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.860> now<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.100> can't

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
when I'm playing like this now I can't

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.990 
when I'm playing like this now I can't
you<00:02:49.880> know<00:02:49.970> my<00:02:50.690> my<00:02:51.200> angle<00:02:51.890> my<00:02:52.160> vantage<00:02:52.460> point<00:02:52.490> is

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
you know my my angle my vantage point is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.670 
you know my my angle my vantage point is
to<00:02:53.210> look<00:02:53.360> at<00:02:53.570> right<00:02:53.810> at<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.020> left<00:02:54.260> side<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
to look at right at the left side of the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.430 
to look at right at the left side of the
neck<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.580> don't<00:02:55.790> necessarily<00:02:56.540> see<00:02:57.050> those

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
neck so I don't necessarily see those

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.530 
neck so I don't necessarily see those
dots<00:02:57.650> but<00:02:57.950> what<00:02:58.100> I<00:02:58.130> do<00:02:58.250> see<00:02:58.640> on<00:02:58.910> my<00:02:59.150> guitar<00:02:59.480> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
dots but what I do see on my guitar and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.600 
dots but what I do see on my guitar and
most<00:02:59.840> guitars<00:02:59.990> have<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:01.400> have

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
most guitars have this is you have

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.810 
most guitars have this is you have
little<00:03:01.880> dots<00:03:02.210> on<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:03.140> side<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.500> your<00:03:03.590> neck<00:03:03.820> so

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
little dots on the side of your neck so

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.790 
little dots on the side of your neck so
that<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.240> can<00:03:05.570> those<00:03:05.750> dots<00:03:06.020> correspond<00:03:06.650> with

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
that you can those dots correspond with

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.830 
that you can those dots correspond with
these<00:03:06.980> dots<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.940> can<00:03:08.120> see<00:03:08.360> really

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
these dots so that you can see really

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.540 
these dots so that you can see really
quickly<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.320> can<00:03:09.530> see<00:03:09.710> exactly<00:03:09.860> where<00:03:10.310> I'm<00:03:10.430> at

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
quickly I can see exactly where I'm at

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.130 
quickly I can see exactly where I'm at
so<00:03:11.120> if<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.270> need<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.510> go<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.720> seventh<00:03:12.020> fret

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
so if I need to go to the seventh fret

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.310 
so if I need to go to the seventh fret
there<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.830> is

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
there it is

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.630 
there it is
and<00:03:15.320> that's<00:03:15.650> what<00:03:15.800> those<00:03:15.920> are<00:03:16.070> for<00:03:16.100> now<00:03:16.430> not

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
and that's what those are for now not

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.240 
and that's what those are for now not
all<00:03:16.670> guitars<00:03:17.020> have<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.440> front<00:03:18.800> markers<00:03:19.100> on

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
all guitars have the front markers on

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.390 
all guitars have the front markers on
the<00:03:19.490> left<00:03:20.270> side<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.630> neck<00:03:20.920> in<00:03:21.920> fact<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
the left side of the neck in fact the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.010 
the left side of the neck in fact the
guitar<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.030> started<00:03:23.450> off<00:03:23.570> with<00:03:23.630> and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
guitar that I started off with and

guitar that I started off with and
played<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.440> four<00:03:24.860> years<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.430> beginning

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
played for four years in the beginning

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
that I buy into that so much I mean

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.720 
that I buy into that so much I mean
that's<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:51.200> me<00:03:51.380> maybe<00:03:51.740> that<00:03:51.980> does<00:03:52.190> help<00:03:52.400> but

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
that's just me maybe that does help but

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.630 
that's just me maybe that does help but
I<00:03:52.910> think<00:03:53.360> posture<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.440> stuff<00:03:54.710> I<00:03:55.160> think<00:03:55.550> the

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
I think posture and stuff I think the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.160 
I think posture and stuff I think the
most<00:03:55.760> important<00:03:56.240> thing<00:03:56.420> is<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.660> be

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
most important thing is to be

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.200 
most important thing is to be
comfortable<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.980> so<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.580> it<00:03:58.730> feels<00:03:58.880> natural

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
comfortable and so that it feels natural

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.020 
comfortable and so that it feels natural
and<00:03:59.770> you<00:04:00.770> do<00:04:00.920> want<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> hold<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.580> with<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.850> back

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
and you do want to hold it with the back

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.840 
and you do want to hold it with the back
of<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.360> pressed<00:04:02.600> up<00:04:02.750> against<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.320> but<00:04:04.190> just

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
of it pressed up against you but just

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.460 
of it pressed up against you but just
because<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.300> helps<00:04:05.540> with<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.780> leverage<00:04:06.140> and

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
because it helps with the leverage and

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.110 
because it helps with the leverage and
you<00:04:06.800> know<00:04:06.920> how<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.190> hold<00:04:07.460> your<00:04:07.610> hand<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.060> how

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
you make the chords and the notes but

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.680 
you make the chords and the notes but
don't<00:04:10.430> worry<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:10.790> much<00:04:10.850> about<00:04:11.000> your<00:04:11.420> posture

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690
