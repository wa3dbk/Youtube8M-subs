00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
here and I haven't started it I did go

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.350 
here and I haven't started it I did go

get the water hose as you see over there

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.960 
get the water hose as you see over there
and<00:00:59.800> we<00:01:00.800> put<00:01:00.980> some<00:01:01.129> water<00:01:01.780> down<00:01:02.780> in<00:01:03.020> yonder<00:01:03.970> and

I<00:01:05.149> think<00:01:05.890> we're<00:01:06.890> going<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.220> try<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.580> start<00:01:08.060> it

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
I think we're going to try to start it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.670 
I think we're going to try to start it
and<00:01:08.960> there<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:09.649> no<00:01:09.830> Magneto<00:01:10.340> as<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:10.820> see<00:01:11.090> I

and there is no Magneto as you see I

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.820 
and there is no Magneto as you see I
close<00:01:12.680> up<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.009> hole<00:01:13.190> there<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:15.140> number<00:01:15.740> on

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
close up the hole there this number on

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.090 
close up the hole there this number on
this<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.250> here<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.670> two<00:01:17.270> nine<00:01:17.690> eight<00:01:18.229> four

what's<00:01:25.100> going<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:27.430> we<00:01:28.430> do<00:01:28.670> have<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.149> ground

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
what's going on we do have it the ground

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.930 
what's going on we do have it the ground
hooked<00:01:33.670> right<00:01:34.670> yonder<00:01:35.709> and<00:01:36.709> we<00:01:37.280> got<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.729> wire

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
hooked right yonder and we got the wire

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.760 
hooked right yonder and we got the wire
hooked<00:01:38.240> up<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:38.720> our<00:01:38.959> igniter

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
hooked up in our igniter

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.190 
hooked up in our igniter
the<00:01:40.670> only<00:01:40.789> thing<00:01:41.060> we'd<00:01:41.240> have<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.569> do<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.990> make

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
the only thing we'd have to do to make

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.699 
the only thing we'd have to do to make
this<00:01:42.410> system<00:01:42.709> hot<00:01:43.130> would<00:01:43.789> be<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:45.140> attach<00:01:45.500> this

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
this system hot would be to attach this

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.580 
this system hot would be to attach this
wire<00:01:45.950> here<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.450> see<00:01:47.599> we<00:01:47.750> got<00:01:47.929> spark<00:01:48.349> here

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
wire here and you see we got spark here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.490 
wire here and you see we got spark here
uh<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:50.060> just<00:01:50.300> let<00:01:50.509> us<00:01:50.630> know<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.289> system

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
uh that just let us know that the system

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.330 
uh that just let us know that the system
is<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:53.140> good<00:01:54.140> working<00:01:54.319> order<00:01:54.530> in<00:01:54.709> contact<00:01:55.220> you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
is in good working order in contact you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.969 
is in good working order in contact you
know<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.990> ground<00:01:57.229> wasn't<00:01:57.619> working<00:01:57.860> we

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
know if that ground wasn't working we

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.880 
know if that ground wasn't working we
wouldn't<00:01:58.099> have<00:01:58.340> no<00:01:58.429> spark<00:01:58.759> here<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.890> we're

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
wouldn't have no spark here so we're

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.540 
wouldn't have no spark here so we're
gonna<00:02:01.069> hook<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.399> up<00:02:01.550> there<00:02:01.929> and<00:02:02.929> then<00:02:03.550> we'll

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
gonna hook it up there and then we'll

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:14.770 
gonna hook it up there and then we'll
look<00:02:04.910> down<00:02:05.349> here<00:02:07.330> at<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.739> choke<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:13.819> just

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
look down here at the choke and we just

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.630 
look down here at the choke and we just
feel<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.200> little<00:02:15.470> bit<00:02:15.739> here<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.190> needle

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
feel a little bit here on this needle

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.260 
feel a little bit here on this needle
valve<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:18.520> don't<00:02:19.520> know<00:02:19.700> if<00:02:19.819> that's<00:02:20.000> going<00:02:20.209> to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
valve I don't know if that's going to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.790 
valve I don't know if that's going to
work<00:02:20.330> but<00:02:20.870> uh<00:02:22.120> said<00:02:23.120> all<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:23.690> done<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.230> set
