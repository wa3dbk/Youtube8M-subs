here<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.890> disease<00:00:02.460> which<00:00:03.300> we<00:00:03.929> may<00:00:04.140> not<00:00:04.170> be

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
here is a disease which we may not be

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.430 
here is a disease which we may not be
able<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.859> totally<00:00:05.390> show<00:00:06.390> just<00:00:06.870> on<00:00:07.080> light

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
able to totally show just on light

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.610 
able to totally show just on light
microscopy<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.150> usually<00:00:09.420> diagnosed<00:00:10.349> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
microscopy and it's usually diagnosed a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.700 
microscopy and it's usually diagnosed a
much<00:00:10.920> better<00:00:11.190> by<00:00:11.490> electron<00:00:12.210> microscopy<00:00:12.710> but

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
much better by electron microscopy but

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.770 
much better by electron microscopy but
nevertheless<00:00:14.070> let's<00:00:14.790> look<00:00:15.059> at<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> little

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
nevertheless let's look at it a little

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
nevertheless let's look at it a little
bit<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.580> kidney

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
bit this is a kidney

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.929 
bit this is a kidney
here's<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.140> blow-up<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> glomerulus

here's a blow-up of the glomerulus

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.769 
here's a blow-up of the glomerulus
