00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:16.170
 oh god i arrived in heaven at 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.970
 browser 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.510
 I'm chunk today I'm here for 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.250
 to present you a new fashion modio gela 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.789
 pocket size mod 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.320
 let's start right away, but I have to do a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.269
 important announcement 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 in a few days youtube will change the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.610
 channel registration rules 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 in what sense all users do not 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.040
 will be active on a channel for about one 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.530
 month so they won't watch the videos but 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.620
 above all, they won't like me 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.050
 will not comment this will be entered 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.980
 automatically from the youtube channel 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.219
 this is because we say the managers of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.680
 youtube claim that many accounts are 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.410
 fake or no longer active 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.699
 so to do a little bit of cleaning 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.189
 especially to increase competition 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.850
 among the important channels have decided to 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.700
 implement this new rule we say that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 if a person or user does not comment 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.990
 I don't like it or it doesn't follow 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.450
 the channel is automatically this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.460
 entered by the channel this will be one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.619
 serious loss for all channels of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.040
 youtube especially for the older ones 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.140
 because since so many people are there now 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.820
 people on youtube that spring youtube there 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 users who first look at youtube then 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.820
 they no longer look at it and others do 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 but they add those that don't 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.079
 they were already registered to the ok channel 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.930
 so all the bigger channels will have 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.420
 a large loss of subscribers if this 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.130
 reform will then be implemented for 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.259
 fight this new reform vi 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.390
 I ask to stay active on the canal 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.759
 putting one like commenting each 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.829
 video if you can do any 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.509
 comment I also reply the comments 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.640
 more stupid with a smiley face 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.500
 interested enough that you stay active 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 because if you can't keep going 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.380
 way anyway all the videos there 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.590
 will be on the canal 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.390
 now let's move on to the review of the mod 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
 today's fashion is the size of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.720
 pocket and gives us the chance gives us the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.730
 possibility to create a new one 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.870
 dimension in which we can do 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.670
 any 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.790
 a flaw of this fashion is that it leaves 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.069
 others is incompatible like me if 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.010
 I access this new dimension with the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.530
 shaders I wo n't see anything I'll show you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.879
 anyway then let's see the mod 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.920
 to access these dimensions 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.370
 portable we need this 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.040
 block precisely the dimensional pocket is 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.900
 quite expensive though we say that there 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.630
 it is from four and four dimensions 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.580
 at the pocket they are really, really useful 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.560
 I'll show you how to get it 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.380
 deal with four stone bric two 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.209
 iron blocks a diamond block e 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.819
 the two objects that are introduced by 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.989
 this fashion the never crystal si si 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.360
 kraft has it this way 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.739
 you have to kill several gases and then 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.260
 lander crystal I was wrong to click 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.870
 ok helander crystal that kraft with the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.660
 so you will have to kill 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.180
 several and air men to do her then 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.370
 offending this dimension anyway 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.220
 poker is very simple to use 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.650
 if you are unable to use them 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.480
 you also have the guide that even more 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.880
 simple it comes with a block and a 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.889
 leather guide explains carefully 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.630
 all there is to do all 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.880
 crafting so you don't have to either 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.030
 use the not enough idem and then it is 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.500
 fashion is very simple 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.269
 really nice because i like it 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.819
 especially for use as you can 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.940
 do i show you because it is a great one 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.760
 cool place a dimensional pocket 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.560
 ok right click to activate these 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.350
 participatory effects that lead us 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.940
 inside the new world 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.430
 See, it's all black like I told you 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.920
 this is because it leaves alone it works 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.989
 well then let's do upton shaders e 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.120
 we turn off the time as you see I'm in 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.160
 this new dimension 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.319
 this new dimension is beautiful 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.450
 because it is also related to the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.579
 normal size ie we can 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.349
 transmit the red son impulses from 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.569
 here to the other and something a little bit 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.940
 detail that you have to find out I have 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.829
 tried to do it twice is not me 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.359
 came once it came to me like 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.729
 let's get back to normal size enough 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.799
 do right shift and now we are 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.330
 here came another thing 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.789
 interesting that we can create gods 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.970
 interdimensional bridges between 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.850
 look at dimensions 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.060
 while in this perfect I put another 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.770
 pocket size here also came in 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.530
 this dimension and so on 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.870
 so I have infinite dimensions 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.670
 we can do it as often as we want 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.650
 logically, then the world becomes overloaded 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.060
 it was because creating a dimension in one 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.060
 dimension in one dimension 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.460
 well it's pretty heavy let's say 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.960
 however it is well done because inside 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.220
 of this space we can create 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.320
 everything 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.570
 if the mode if the package in which 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.450
 we insert this fashion is technical we can 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.580
 also divide all the various sectors by 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.840
 example do not know wind energy 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.490
 of water 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.080
 in all these dimensions and to do 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.990
 return all the energy 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.060
 finally to the normal world so there is one 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.250
 correlation between all the dimensions that 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.170
 makes this fashion fantastic let's go back 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.780
 in the normal world always doing shift 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.310
 right click and as you can see we are back 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.280
 to our normal size 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.800
 fashion is beautiful just for the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.860
 fact that it is all chained together between the 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.500
 different worlds and is perfect for creating 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.540
 especially the fashions technical pec 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.770
 I recommend a lot and remember you 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.020
 guys still put it like it 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.910
 write videos subscribe to the channel 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.100
 share the video comment for 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.530
 stay up to date prevent youtube 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.260
 take you away from the members 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.300
 put so many beautiful reichs to the thousand likes 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.380
 I will publish a new video sign up 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.990
 to the channel in see you next 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.990
 video from patches all hello to everyone
