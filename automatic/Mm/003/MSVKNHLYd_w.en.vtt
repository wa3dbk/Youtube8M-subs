things<00:01:00.159> can<00:01:00.429> be<00:01:00.489> great<00:01:00.760> but<00:01:00.909> if<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.089> don't

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
things can be great but if you don't

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.020 
things can be great but if you don't
have<00:01:01.390> great<00:01:01.659> picture<00:01:02.079> quality<00:01:02.109> it's<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:03.429> ok

have great picture quality it's a ok

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.490 
have great picture quality it's a ok
experience<00:01:04.570> we<00:01:04.930> have<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.170> best<00:01:05.320> experience

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
experience we have the best experience

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.770 
experience we have the best experience
possible<00:01:05.890> because<00:01:06.490> we<00:01:06.610> have<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.909> best<00:01:07.180> engine

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
possible because we have the best engine

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.390 
possible because we have the best engine
and<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.409> engine<00:01:08.680> would<00:01:08.800> be<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.010> x-reality

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
and that engine would be the x-reality

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.550 
and that engine would be the x-reality
pro<00:01:09.490> engine<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.540> makes<00:01:10.870> everything<00:01:11.050> look

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
pro engine it makes everything look

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.530 
pro engine it makes everything look
better<00:01:11.830> one<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.759> ways<00:01:12.909> we<00:01:13.119> do<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.299> is<00:01:13.420> we

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
better one of the ways we do it is we

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.209 
better one of the ways we do it is we
actually<00:01:13.960> have<00:01:14.409> something<00:01:14.649> called<00:01:14.799> multiple

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
actually have something called multiple

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.810 
actually have something called multiple
frame<00:01:15.520> analysis<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:17.409> looks<00:01:17.860> at<00:01:18.100> all<00:01:18.520> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
frame analysis and it looks at all the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.999 
frame analysis and it looks at all the
pixels<00:01:19.270> in<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.479> current<00:01:19.810> frame<00:01:20.079> looks<00:01:20.829> at

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
pixels in the current frame looks at

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.090 
pixels in the current frame looks at
past<00:01:21.640> frames<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.210> future<00:01:22.509> frames<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.170> then

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
past frames and future frames and then

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.330 
past frames and future frames and then
it<00:01:24.520> fills<00:01:24.909> in<00:01:25.149> Los<00:01:25.329> resolution<00:01:26.110> now<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.619> other

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
it fills in Los resolution now the other

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.420 
it fills in Los resolution now the other
step<00:01:27.820> is<00:01:28.060> in<00:01:28.450> 3d<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:29.229> processor<00:01:29.829> can

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
step is in 3d this processor can

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.609 
step is in 3d this processor can
actually<00:01:30.880> tell<00:01:31.180> whether<00:01:31.840> something<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.350> near

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
actually tell whether something is near

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.160 
actually tell whether something is near
or<00:01:32.799> far<00:01:32.829> in<00:01:33.399> a<00:01:33.490> 3d<00:01:33.820> picture<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.450> adjust

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
or far in a 3d picture and adjust

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.679 
or far in a 3d picture and adjust
accordingly<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.060> means<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.359> you<00:01:37.539> get

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
accordingly what that means is you get

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.490 
accordingly what that means is you get
deeper<00:01:38.079> 3d<00:01:38.500> more<00:01:39.340> realistic<00:01:39.640> 3d<00:01:40.119> so<00:01:41.049> more<00:01:41.469> of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
deeper 3d more realistic 3d so more of

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.800 
deeper 3d more realistic 3d so more of
immersive<00:01:42.100> experience<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.850> what's<00:01:43.689> really

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
immersive experience and what's really

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.719 
immersive experience and what's really
nice<00:01:44.049> about<00:01:44.109> it<00:01:44.350> too<00:01:44.500> is<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.740> reduces<00:01:45.159> I<00:01:45.340> string

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
nice about it too is it reduces I string

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.999 
nice about it too is it reduces I string
speaking<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.359> 3d<00:01:46.719> this<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.590> my<00:01:47.740> favorite
