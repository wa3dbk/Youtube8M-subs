a<00:02:37.510> short<00:02:37.750> day<00:02:37.870> i<00:02:37.900> think<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.590> probably

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
a short day i think it is probably

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.650 
a short day i think it is probably
undecided<00:02:39.460> is<00:02:39.580> whether<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:40.240> can<00:02:40.330> play<00:02:40.630> a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
undecided is whether you can play a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.390 
undecided is whether you can play a
proper<00:02:41.020> seven<00:02:41.350> at<00:02:41.470> international<00:02:42.010> level<00:02:42.040> and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
proper seven at international level and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.430 
proper seven at international level and
then<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:43.000> he<00:02:43.090> good<00:02:43.240> enough<00:02:43.330> at<00:02:43.570> six<00:02:43.810> he's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
then is he good enough at six he's

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.250 
then is he good enough at six he's
probably<00:02:44.650> caught<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.400> no<00:02:46.150> man's<00:02:46.450> land<00:02:46.720> those

research look at this research by easy
yes<00:04:04.870> yeah<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:06.040> that's<00:04:06.400> in<00:04:06.520> stringer<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.820> think

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
yes yeah so that's in stringer I think

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.960 
yes yeah so that's in stringer I think
where<00:04:08.440> we<00:04:08.530> going<00:04:08.739> wrong<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.010> rugby<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.520> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
where we going wrong in rugby is the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.580 
where we going wrong in rugby is the
fact<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.239> we<00:04:10.450> have<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:10.870> many<00:04:10.930> laws<00:04:11.290> they're

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
fact that we have so many laws they're

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.680 
fact that we have so many laws they're
so<00:04:11.770> complex<00:04:12.190> yeah<00:04:12.459> but<00:04:12.880> we<00:04:13.000> don't<00:04:13.239> do<00:04:13.540> them

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
so complex yeah but we don't do them

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.870 
so complex yeah but we don't do them
objectively<00:04:13.930> they<00:04:14.680> are<00:04:14.739> rift<00:04:15.010> subjectively

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
objectively they are rift subjectively

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.190 
objectively they are rift subjectively
and<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.299> think<00:04:16.510> that's<00:04:16.720> where<00:04:16.900> you're<00:04:17.020> going

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
and I think that's where you're going

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.199 
and I think that's where you're going
wrong<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.890> I<00:04:17.980> think<00:04:18.160> Fox<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.489> right<00:04:18.700> in<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.970> berm

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
wrong and I think Fox is right in a berm

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.729 
wrong and I think Fox is right in a berm
one<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.900> areas<00:04:19.930> where<00:04:20.320> it's<00:04:20.440> going<00:04:20.590> wrong

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
one of the areas where it's going wrong

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.830 
one of the areas where it's going wrong
is<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:20.919> breakdown<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:22.210> know<00:04:22.360> most

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
is the breakdown and you know most

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.180 
is the breakdown and you know most
people<00:04:23.080> speak<00:04:23.229> about<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:24.190> mall<00:04:24.400> going<00:04:24.700> wrong

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
people speak about the mall going wrong

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.730 
people speak about the mall going wrong
but<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.790> rack<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.120> also<00:04:26.450> yeah<00:04:27.110> slightly

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
but the rack is also yeah slightly

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.090 
but the rack is also yeah slightly

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.120 
is not formed and I think what folks is
getting<00:04:40.580> at<00:04:40.790> is<00:04:41.090> so<00:04:42.020> when<00:04:42.200> is<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.380> form<00:04:42.680> in<00:04:42.890> a

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
getting at is so when is a form in a

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.130 
getting at is so when is a form in a
riff<00:04:43.550> speak<00:04:43.820> about<00:04:44.000> beaten<00:04:44.330> by<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.480> rack<00:04:44.690> so

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
riff speak about beaten by the rack so

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.560 
riff speak about beaten by the rack so
if<00:04:45.230> there's<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.410> tackle<00:04:45.740> situation<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.460> /

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
if there's a tackle situation and /

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.300 
if there's a tackle situation and /
or<00:04:47.810> burger<00:04:48.260> have<00:04:48.680> got<00:04:48.860> their<00:04:49.010> hands<00:04:49.190> and

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
or burger have got their hands and

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.950 
or burger have got their hands and
they're<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.580> one<00:04:49.790> second<00:04:50.240> late<00:04:50.270> because<00:04:50.600> two

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
they're just one second late because two

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.010 
they're just one second late because two
players<00:04:51.230> have<00:04:51.500> never<00:04:51.980> made<00:04:52.520> contact<00:04:52.930> then<00:04:53.930> I

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
players have never made contact then I

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.210 
players have never made contact then I
beaten<00:04:54.290> by<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.440> right<00:04:54.620> thing<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:54.860> can't<00:04:55.070> have

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
beaten by the right thing you can't have

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.950 
beaten by the right thing you can't have
your<00:04:55.310> hands<00:04:55.580> in<00:04:55.700> so<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:55.910> think<00:04:56.210> that's<00:04:56.450> that's

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
your hands in so I think that's that's

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.110 
your hands in so I think that's that's
objectively<00:04:57.590> rift<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:58.520> other<00:04:58.700> thing<00:04:58.970> is

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
objectively rift the other thing is

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.720 
objectively rift the other thing is
joining<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.660> rack<00:05:00.020> so<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.650> says<00:05:00.890> there<00:05:01.160> you

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
joining the rack so it says there you

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.870 
joining the rack so it says there you
must<00:05:01.970> have<00:05:02.210> one<00:05:02.420> full<00:05:02.720> on<00:05:02.900> bound<00:05:03.230> art<00:05:03.530> on<00:05:03.880> your

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
must have one full on bound art on your

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.150 
must have one full on bound art on your
team<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.210> never<00:05:05.390> never<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:05.990> for<00:05:06.320> me<00:05:06.470> it's<00:05:06.920> one

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
team and never never and for me it's one

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.040 
team and never never and for me it's one
of<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.310> injuries<00:05:07.970> waiting<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:08.720> happen<00:05:08.960> in

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
of the injuries waiting to happen in

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.080 
of the injuries waiting to happen in

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
much more dangerous than the scrum

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
email mine before they do that so I

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.110 
email mine before they do that so I
think<00:05:21.560> that's<00:05:21.740> concerning<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.490> then<00:05:23.000> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
think that's concerning and then the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.580 
think that's concerning and then the
joining<00:05:23.510> of<00:05:23.600> the<00:05:23.690> rack<00:05:23.870> I've<00:05:24.050> even<00:05:24.260> got<00:05:24.560> a

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
joining of the rack I've even got a

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.460 
joining of the rack I've even got a
picture<00:05:25.010> in<00:05:25.460> credit<00:05:25.850> sir<00:05:26.030> wow<00:05:26.690> ok<00:05:27.230> this<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:29.470> my

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
picture in credit sir wow ok this is my

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.340 
picture in credit sir wow ok this is my
spit<00:05:30.800> up<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.390> is<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.720> offside<00:05:33.110> line

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
spit up so that is the offside line

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.280 
spit up so that is the offside line
behind<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:34.580> hindmost<00:05:35.030> players<00:05:35.600> feet<00:05:35.960> right

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
behind the hindmost players feet right

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
behind the hindmost players feet right
so<00:05:36.530> you<00:05:36.590> can<00:05:36.800> only<00:05:37.100> join<00:05:37.580> with<00:05:38.240> an<00:05:38.480> arm<00:05:38.840> bound

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
so you can only join with an arm bound

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.690 
so you can only join with an arm bound
either<00:05:40.310> behind<00:05:41.000> or<00:05:41.890> alongside<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.490> home

the<00:06:16.370> game<00:06:16.520> and<00:06:17.330> it's<00:06:17.480> got<00:06:17.630> another<00:06:17.990> set<00:06:18.169> of<00:06:18.260> our

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
the game and it's got another set of our

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.930 
the game and it's got another set of our
balls<00:06:18.590> on<00:06:18.770> I<00:06:18.919> think<00:06:19.130> it's<00:06:19.250> worth<00:06:19.430> having<00:06:19.880> a

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
balls on I think it's worth having a

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.360 
balls on I think it's worth having a
look<00:06:19.970> at<00:06:20.210> that<00:06:20.330> in<00:06:20.570> real<00:06:21.500> rugby<00:06:21.860> so<00:06:22.070> to<00:06:22.130> speak

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
look at that in real rugby so to speak

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.010 
look at that in real rugby so to speak
the<00:06:23.060> other<00:06:23.180> thing<00:06:23.360> is<00:06:23.450> that<00:06:23.480> they<00:06:23.660> call<00:06:23.870> them

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
the other thing is that they call them

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.690 
the other thing is that they call them
assistant<00:06:24.440> referees<00:06:24.830> now<00:06:25.040> and<00:06:25.280> they're<00:06:25.610> not

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
assistant referees now and they're not

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.730
