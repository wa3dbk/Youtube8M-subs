00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.739
 the German artist I saw him scoring I was born in the western part of Prussia in the 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.380
 bosom of a bourgeois family 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.380
 as a child he had been struck by his gifts for drawing 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.090
 Corinth studied at the art academy of building 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.740
 with the seismic academy that imposed the school of art by Jose Style 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.820
 realistic 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.500
 his perfectly figurative portraits a clear example of his first era 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 he painted all kinds of everyday scenes and still lifes 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.770
 however, at the same time he made historical paintings with scenes 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.440
 mythological and biblical 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 the painter used the natural format for these subjects 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.860
 Another of the recurring themes was the bacchanalia, take care of the reflection of the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.750
 epoch lived by Corinth in the bohemian city of Munich 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.320
 by then the painter was known for his fondness for wine and cheap champagne 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 but not for being an artist 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.100
 after the studies he moved to Berlin in 1901 opening an art school 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.170
 for women 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.659
 there he met chaco want one of his first students 20 years younger than 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:38.580
 the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.120
 charlot his wife and the mother of his two children became his muse 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.940
 maintaining a great influence on the painter and being a recurring theme in the 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 work of that time 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.040
 in 1911 and at the age of 53 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.040
 we discussed it I suffered a cerebral infarction 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.350
 apparently the clinical history is not preserved 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.690
 but based on camerini lies in his first drawings and paintings I think that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.410
 the most likely symptoms are with impact on the distribution area of 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.079
 middle age brochures 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.469
 with a smooth cloth spain avite evident earth its first drawings 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.969
 my father told me that what was immobilized in a bed of 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:33.949
 hospital 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.189
 being still like that I asked the track but to draw 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.719
 according to my father so to sketches of monstrous rivals since that image 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.700
 It is from famous historical figures that are part of their solution, he said. 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:46.979
 Many of these 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:47.889
 They got lost 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.299
 they were destroyed 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.069
 with this we 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.949
 3 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.949
 He also explained the difficulties with which he had those principles 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.629
 his left hand did not obey him with complicated tasks while 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.269
 he had a persistent fear in his right hand 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.909
 some experts consider that the brushstrokes of one of his paintings 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.909
 after the accident have to do with those fears 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:12.640
 Fortunately 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.919
 when he returned to Berlin in 1912 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.639
 it started to recover and after a couple of years it had enough strength 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.609
 like nothing 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.609
 and take long walks with no help other than the cane 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.199
 while the life of Luis changed radically 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.489
 swart evolved and improve quality 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.660
 he continued to paint everyday and mythological scenes but from other 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.829
 motivations 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.459
 The celestial sansÃ³n of 1912 represents the physical and psychic state that they had 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.459
 artist by then 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.739
 the brushstrokes of his paintings began to present a frequent and predominant 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.469
 diagonal direction the technical skill did not decrease but it adopted 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.469
 a more expressive style 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.879
 currently very little is known only an emotional state expire which although 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.939
 have with pictorial styles 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.039
 Researchers at the University of Oxford 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.449
 have been tempted I was last years in the study of the area called cortex 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.229
 squad also called ceprede 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:19.389
 that exists in both hemispheres of the brain and governs the selection of a 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.529
 active 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.229
 It has been proven that after a stroke on one side and 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.119
 for this and whose injuries analyze a member the impact hemisphere impact 

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:32.119
 increases its activity by initiating a compensatory mechanism 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.569
 its last stage makes difficult execution to prevail highly 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.569
 explosives 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.969
 After finishing his last bull treatment the painter died in May 1925 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.599
 after getting sick from a pneumonia on a last trip to holland effected 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.599
 to see the beam of his beloved franc 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.800
 my father always told us some anecdotes about the maniac nature of 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.039
 London 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.470
 according to him he painted when I discovered something he deserved painted 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.729
 could be any minute detail as a gesture a lighting in 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.159
 concrete but this was enough for him to decide they started new square 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.699
 the family had to be patient with him and pass as she said yes 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.870
 when Gil came to power in 1933 the works of the first time of Corinth 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.170
 were respected but the hours after the accident were 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.169
 censored included in degenerate art 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:52.610
 charlot luckily 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.400
 he could escape from the country in the midst of the dictatorship with many of his works 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.369
 delayed 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:01.179
 thanks to that we can enjoy one of the most German artists 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:02.599
 interesting of all time
