so<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.560> new<00:00:01.709> controller<00:00:02.100> truly<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.909> really

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
so the new controller truly is a really

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.240 
so the new controller truly is a really
amazing<00:00:03.570> piece<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:04.049> kit<00:00:04.230> because<00:00:04.500> it<00:00:04.830> has<00:00:05.040> a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
amazing piece of kit because it has a

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.160 
amazing piece of kit because it has a
lot<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> simple<00:00:06.029> impose<00:00:06.390> but<00:00:06.660> when<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:06.960> combine

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
lot of simple impose but when we combine

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.549 
lot of simple impose but when we combine
them<00:00:07.470> together<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:08.099> becomes<00:00:08.220> very<00:00:08.550> very<00:00:08.760> rich

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
we talked with a lot of developers saw

we talked with a lot of developers saw
what<00:00:15.900> they<00:00:16.139> really<00:00:16.350> want<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.060> what<00:00:18.060> they

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
what they really want and what they

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.779 
what they really want and what they

everyone it seems like a minor thing but

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.609 
everyone it seems like a minor thing but
it<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.210> helps<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.600> flow<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> the

the controller touched by these
multi-touch<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:30.180> able<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.450> have

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
multi-touch and you're able to have

multi-touch and you're able to have
touch<00:01:30.810> interactions<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.650> very

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
touch interactions that are very

touch interactions that are very
comfortable<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.610> play<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.450> your

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
comfortable to play so you can use your

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.090 
comfortable to play so you can use your
thermal<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.439> could<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.710> freaking

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
thermal so you could be freaking

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
thermal so you could be freaking
freaking<00:01:35.549> things<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.689> add<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
freaking things out and then you add the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
freaking things out and then you add the
fact<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.259> there's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> speaker<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:37.979> the

fact that there's a speaker on the
