00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hi, I'm Mario Arias, your advisor 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.770
 Photography in nikon art photography 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.790
 of 5,200 is a product in the range 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.260
 intermediate of reflex camera srb type 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.509
 classic camera concept but I think 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.039
 that covers the expectations of the greatest 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.500
 part of the fans that are in 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.180
 that intermediate position that they have already 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.680
 maybe passed through other SLR products 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.590
 digital and what they want is to improve 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.970
 sensibly your current team 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.710
 there is currently an offer from her 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.879
 I think irresistible that consists of 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.890
 target 1855 plus the 125 200 this price 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.960
 it does not reach even the 800 euros and I think 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.580
 that's good inside what is this 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.339
 price segment and for this kind of 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.839
 users under my point of view is from 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.479
 art photography at least I think it's 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.269
 which I can best recommend incorporates 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.909
 a spectacular sensor to psc of 24 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.710
 megapixels with a speed 3 processor 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.089
 with which we have guaranteed the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.510
 processing speed of what is 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.030
 very important and very fast the sensor 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.440
 it performs well even with the and they are more 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.500
 elevated 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.290
 really creative when it comes to making 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.300
 photography both automatic or manual 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.000
 incorporates unlike other models 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.310
 like the 3200 from the manufacturer itself up 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.810
 16 scene modes totally 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.820
 automated for those people who 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.410
 do not want to go beyond one 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.870
 automatic but also shooting 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.210
 quality 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.530
 and incorporates all positions and 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.480
 possibilities obviously of 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.330
 complicated photography opening or 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.160
 manual for those fans or well 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.740
 in a photography academy or else by 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.140
 be self-taught want to go to start it 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.210
 to learn and know more about what is 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.040
 elements of digital photography and 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.160
 well, it covers perfectly all this 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.920
 kind of spectrum and it also records very 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.930
 good of people videos in full hd up to 60 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 frames per second has a microphone 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.270
 integrated stereo an autofocus 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.790
 for the photograph consisting of 39 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.110
 points which will make you fast 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.580
 approach to those stories that are in 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 really spectacular movement 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.940
 even superior to what can be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.670
 let's say something could be cameras 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.040
 professionals well also these modes 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.870
 automatic has an acknowledgment of 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.700
 scenes so that I still simplify more 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.370
 things and a portrait with the portraits 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.200
 in a landscape is put in landscape has 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.060
 the possibility through the button is 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.060
 a range of digital effects 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.290
 incorporated without needing 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.330
 incorporate it into the computer or do it with 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.910
 the computer to be able to do it with the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.210
 own camera 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.610
 has burst mode up to 5 frames 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.260
 per second when we record video with 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.400
 she can maintain the focus 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.590
 automatic 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.790
 there they are making a great effort 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.000
 all manufacturers and in especially 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.650
 nikon and also canon to compete with 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.330
 the 6000 cameras without a mirror that a 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.980
 more natural way yes they have this 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.020
 but good the most modern models more 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.180
 current we can incorporate the approach 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.690
 automatic on video does it is pretty 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.360
 quite significant this point has 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.760
 a function also hdr that means 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.580
 that in the same photo sao makes two 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.920
 photographs with only one with one 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.920
 shutter shot for then let's say 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.120
 combine them and some to get a 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.670
 let's say a detail so much the high lights 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.320
 with the low lights spectacular why 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 for those fans that the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.430
 use in automatic and want to have 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.350
 in let's say the whole community of the world 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.770
 but without sacrificing any more apex than 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.540
 nothing to sacrifice anything of quality with 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.300
 all the technological advances because I 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.080
 I think they incorporate it then well 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.720
 for the combination this 18 55 plus a 55 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.780
 200 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.000
 the two are vr besides which is why 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.850
 we will get to have the talitas where the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.460
 image is totally guaranteed because I 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.050
 I think it is a highly recommended product 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.110
 very significantly 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.900
 let's say economic I would say and now and good 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.840
 of course and one advice is that those 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.760
 that you have certain doubts in investment 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.040
 we could have with two objectives are 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.350
 those 800 euros will not lower us around 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.720
 the 150 euros say between the following 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.150
 the scale between 600 900 euros me 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.430
 I think it 's the best place for today of the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.140
 market as I always tell you can you 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.600
 stop by the store and make a demo 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.970
 of this product or solve them any 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.040
 doubt well on our website 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.900
 phone I will be happy with activity 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.800
 I hope you liked it and until 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.800
 next videos
