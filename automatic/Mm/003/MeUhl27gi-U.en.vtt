everyone once bitten here so without it
I<00:00:02.669> would<00:00:03.030> do<00:00:03.149> something<00:00:03.510> new<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.899> post<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
I would do something new and post a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.800 
I would do something new and post a
painting<00:00:05.190> log<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:05.940> seems<00:00:06.180> like<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.420> paint<00:00:06.660> all

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
painting log it seems like I paint all

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.940 
painting log it seems like I paint all
the<00:00:06.930> time<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.410> get<00:00:07.620> very<00:00:07.740> little

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
the time and I get very little

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.060 
the time and I get very little
accomplished<00:00:08.760> doing<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.170> over<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
accomplished doing it so over the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950 
accomplished doing it so over the
holidays<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> had<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.969> lot<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> extra<00:00:12.540> time<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
holidays I had a lot of extra time and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.350 
holidays I had a lot of extra time and
so<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.110> thought<00:00:13.349> I'd<00:00:13.530> posts<00:00:13.950> close<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.089> pictures

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
so I thought I'd posts close up pictures

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.630 
so I thought I'd posts close up pictures
of<00:00:15.389> models<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.020> will<00:00:16.109> likely<00:00:16.320> see<00:00:16.640> on

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of models that you will likely see on

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.510 
of models that you will likely see on

sorry<00:00:36.000> for<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> blurry<00:00:36.360> picture<00:00:36.750> but

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
sorry for the blurry picture but

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.889 
sorry for the blurry picture but
painting<00:00:38.460> these<00:00:38.610> again<00:00:39.030> he<00:00:39.329> base<00:00:39.540> painted

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
painting these again he base painted

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.790 
painting these again he base painted
them<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.170> were<00:00:40.260> based<00:00:40.440> painted<00:00:40.710> before

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
them or they were based painted before

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.940 
them or they were based painted before
so<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.820> had<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> highlight<00:00:42.329> an<00:00:42.540> ink<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
so I just had to highlight an ink and it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.270 
so I just had to highlight an ink and it
probably<00:00:44.219> took<00:00:44.520> me<00:00:44.700> five<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.030> six<00:00:45.180> hours<00:00:46.219> can<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
probably took me five or six hours can I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.500 
probably took me five or six hours can I
had<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> crick<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.670> my<00:00:47.789> neck<00:00:47.850> by<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> time<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:48.420> was

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
had a crick in my neck by the time i was

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.010 
had a crick in my neck by the time i was
done<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.829> didn't<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:51.660> model

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
done and I didn't get to the to model

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.709 
done and I didn't get to the to model
the<00:00:52.199> movement<00:00:52.680> tray<00:00:52.829> yet<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:54.059> overall<00:00:54.390> that's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the movement tray yet but overall that's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.990 
the movement tray yet but overall that's
how<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> first<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.699> second

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
how is that's the first or second

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.220 
how is that's the first or second
completely<00:00:57.390> finished<00:00:57.690> unit<00:00:57.960> first<00:00:58.079> dwarf

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
completely finished unit first dwarf

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
completely finished unit first dwarf
army<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:59.760> happy<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.239> done

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
army so pretty happy to get that done

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.299 
army so pretty happy to get that done
and<00:01:00.690> certainly<00:01:01.350> represents<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> significant

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
and certainly represents a significant

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.200 
and certainly represents a significant
amount<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> time<00:01:02.930> also<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> dwarf<00:01:04.260> army<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
amount of time also in the dwarf army I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.950 
amount of time also in the dwarf army I
painted<00:01:06.210> his<00:01:06.299> gyrocopter<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:08.750> was<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> guy

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
painted his gyrocopter and a was a guy

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
painted his gyrocopter and a was a guy
ah<00:01:09.990> copter<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.560> never<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:10.950> anyway<00:01:11.700> we

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
ah copter I never know anyway we

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.270 
ah copter I never know anyway we
couldn't<00:01:12.900> find<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> model<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
couldn't find the model that is the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
couldn't find the model that is the
pilot<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.240> built<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.810> from

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
pilot so we just built this one from

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.420 
pilot so we just built this one from
scratch<00:01:16.140> he's<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.619> regular<00:01:16.890> warrior<00:01:17.130> model

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
scratch he's in a regular warrior model

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
scratch he's in a regular warrior model
and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.180> thought<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.479> were<00:01:18.630> somewhat<00:01:19.140> clever

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and I thought we were somewhat clever

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.810 
and I thought we were somewhat clever
and<00:01:19.710> giving<00:01:20.040> him<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.369> mug<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> beer<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.930> beer

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
and giving him a mug of beer with beer

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
and giving him a mug of beer with beer
slopping<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:23.939> over<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> side<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:28.020> slightly

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
slopping out over the side so slightly

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
slopping out over the side so slightly
blurry<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.189> overall<00:01:30.060> happy<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.540> how<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
blurry that overall happy with how that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.630 
blurry that overall happy with how that
turned<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:33.710> yeah<00:01:34.710> it'll<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.100> nice<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
turned out yeah it'll be nice to see it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.429 
turned out yeah it'll be nice to see it
on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> tabletop<00:01:36.150> painted<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.140> also

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
on the tabletop painted and then I also

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.429 
on the tabletop painted and then I also
did<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.950> couple<00:01:41.189> models<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.850> beastmen<00:01:42.150> army

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
did a couple models for my beastmen army

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
did a couple models for my beastmen army
the<00:01:43.439> first<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> dumba<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.340> felt<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the first is a dumba I felt that I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.569 
the first is a dumba I felt that I
didn't<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.020> justice<00:01:46.250> using<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.399> regular

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
didn't do justice using a regular

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
didn't do justice using a regular
minotaur<00:01:48.090> model<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> awesomeness<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
minotaur model for the awesomeness that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.889 
minotaur model for the awesomeness that
is<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> doom<00:01:50.130> bull<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> went<00:01:51.240> invested

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
is the doom bull and so I went invested

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.980 
is the doom bull and so I went invested
in<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:53.479> one<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> new<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.079> an<00:01:55.350> old<00:01:55.470> metal

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
