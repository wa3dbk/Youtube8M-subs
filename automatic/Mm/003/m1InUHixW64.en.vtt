think they're really well lit though and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.149 
think they're really well lit though and
they<00:01:53.640> look<00:01:53.820> great<00:01:54.000> too<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.860> conquest

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
they look great too and the conquest

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
they look great too and the conquest
match<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:57.450> fast<00:01:57.690> pace<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.259> mean

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
match is a really fast pace that mean

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
match is a really fast pace that mean
it's<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.740> long<00:01:58.890> before<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.250> faint<00:01:59.490> enemy

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060

it's not long before you faint enemy
players<00:02:00.330> say<00:02:01.289> it's<00:02:01.530> obviously<00:02:01.860> similar<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
players say it's obviously similar to a

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.910 
players say it's obviously similar to a
skirmish<00:02:03.479> maps<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:04.110> original<00:02:04.409> skirmish<00:02:04.740> maps

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.580 
on bf Felix en crossing anyway which
leaves<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.399> great<00:02:08.550> gameplay<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.630> console

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
leaves for great gameplay on a console

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.080 
leaves for great gameplay on a console
especially<00:02:11.130> because<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.489> was<00:02:11.580> only<00:02:11.730> 24
