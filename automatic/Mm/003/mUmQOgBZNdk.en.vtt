00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
useful if there's like for example right

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.430 
useful if there's like for example right
over<00:02:21.700> here<00:02:21.879> to<00:02:22.060> my<00:02:22.180> left<00:02:22.319> there's<00:02:23.319> some

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
over here to my left there's some

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.080 
over here to my left there's some
obstacles<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.280> if<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.489> cannot<00:02:24.670> really<00:02:24.849> see

obstacles and if you cannot really see

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.640 
obstacles and if you cannot really see
them<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.330> sin<00:02:25.540> battles<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.959> cannot<00:02:26.200> switch<00:02:26.500> to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
them in sin battles you cannot switch to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.130 
them in sin battles you cannot switch to
the<00:02:26.799> driver<00:02:27.580> view<00:02:28.030> which<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.900> bind

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the driver view which you have to bind

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.839 
the driver view which you have to bind
in<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> settings<00:02:29.830> obviously<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.819> then

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
in the settings obviously and then

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.309 
in the settings obviously and then
commute<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.629> can<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.019> up<00:02:32.140> you

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
commute and see you can just get up you

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.420 
commute and see you can just get up you
can<00:02:32.349> get<00:02:32.560> away<00:02:32.650> from<00:02:32.799> them<00:02:33.069> or<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.280> can

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
can get away from them or you can

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.229 
can get away from them or you can
actually<00:02:33.610> see<00:02:33.849> if<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:36.370> your<00:02:36.430> bottom<00:02:37.060> is
