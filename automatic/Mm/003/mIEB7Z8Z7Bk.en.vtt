00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.870

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.140
 I saw out there then let's make cast 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.369
 The first base our nails and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.689
 let's make a thick line of this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.860
 Now we are going to make you an appointment line 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.340

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.340
 the nails 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.760
 It is a very simple decoration but very 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.760
 beautiful 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.220
 Now let's do the little eyes to 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220
 our little face 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.269
 the tip of a brush 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.750
 there is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.420
 they can do it with enamel or with 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.780
 vinyls 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.110
