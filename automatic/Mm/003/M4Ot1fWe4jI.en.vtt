00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
so he doesn't seem to know much he

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
so he doesn't seem to know much he
thinks<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.990> he<00:01:43.140> knows<00:01:43.290> everything<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.950> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
thinks that he knows everything and you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.859 
thinks that he knows everything and you
know<00:01:44.430> i<00:01:44.520> did<00:01:44.790> assume<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.299> he<00:01:45.450> doesn't<00:01:45.659> know

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
know i did assume that he doesn't know

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
know i did assume that he doesn't know
something<00:01:46.290> about<00:01:46.350> fall<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.310> don't

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
something about fall for that we don't

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
something about fall for that we don't
but<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.689> really<00:01:48.990> hard<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> believe<00:01:49.380> anything

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
but it's really hard to believe anything

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.920 
but it's really hard to believe anything
right<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> question<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.659> does

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
the wii evil within and what's funny is

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.990

that Bethesda is only publishing these
games<00:03:53.240> and<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.750> think<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.200> had<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.350> little<00:03:54.530> bit<00:03:54.709> of

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
games and I think I had a little bit of

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.770 
games and I think I had a little bit of
development<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:56.030> Elder<00:03:56.360> Scrolls<00:03:56.390> online

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780

development in the Elder Scrolls online
i<00:03:56.990> would<00:03:57.170> be<00:03:57.260> surprised<00:03:57.530> they<00:03:57.740> didn't<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.730> I

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
i would be surprised they didn't but I

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.640 
i would be surprised they didn't but I
know<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.270> Bethesda<00:03:59.660> really<00:04:00.290> isn't

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
know that Bethesda really isn't

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.870 
know that Bethesda really isn't
developing<00:04:01.959> Wolfenstein<00:04:02.959> or<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:04.550> evil

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
developing Wolfenstein or the evil

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.090 
developing Wolfenstein or the evil
within<00:04:05.000> which<00:04:05.720> looked<00:04:06.080> like<00:04:06.260> fantastic<00:04:06.890> games

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
within which looked like fantastic games

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.460 
within which looked like fantastic games
but<00:04:07.370> uh<00:04:07.480> not<00:04:08.480> sure<00:04:08.510> why<00:04:08.900> they're<00:04:09.110> trying<00:04:09.410> to

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470
