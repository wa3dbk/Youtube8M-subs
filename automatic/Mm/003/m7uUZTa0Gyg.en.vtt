highbanker build and let's start with

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.350 
highbanker build and let's start with
the<00:00:14.949> basics

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
the basics

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.390

I've been blowing up all over the place
and<00:00:20.980> working<00:00:21.430> on<00:00:21.520> projects<00:00:22.060> so<00:00:22.150> this<00:00:22.330> is<00:00:22.480> the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690

inches wide and what I was pulling for
with<00:00:31.030> this<00:00:31.210> one<00:00:31.450> is<00:00:32.039> something<00:00:33.039> between<00:00:33.870> if

you're a gold hog fan something between

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.069 
you're a gold hog fan something between
the<00:00:37.750> mini<00:00:38.020> and<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.340> Viper<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:40.000> Viper<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.810> just

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
the mini and the Viper the Viper is just

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.540 
the mini and the Viper the Viper is just
way<00:00:41.320> more<00:00:41.350> than<00:00:41.739> I'm<00:00:41.860> ever<00:00:42.040> gonna<00:00:42.190> deal<00:00:42.520> with

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
way more than I'm ever gonna deal with

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.790 
way more than I'm ever gonna deal with
and<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.239> mini<00:00:43.450> seems<00:00:43.810> like<00:00:44.020> it<00:00:44.140> just<00:00:44.440> feels<00:00:44.649> a

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
and the mini seems like it just feels a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.479 
and the mini seems like it just feels a
little<00:00:44.829> too<00:00:45.130> small<00:00:45.399> so<00:00:46.390> 60<00:00:47.140> inches<00:00:47.500> 10<00:00:48.160> inches

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
little too small so 60 inches 10 inches

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.830 
little too small so 60 inches 10 inches
wide<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.559> it's<00:00:50.829> 6<00:00:51.190> inches<00:00:51.399> deep<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.149> I<00:00:52.600> did

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
wide and it's 6 inches deep and I did

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.569 
wide and it's 6 inches deep and I did
that<00:00:52.989> on<00:00:53.170> purpose<00:00:53.200> because<00:00:53.620> I<00:00:54.010> wanted<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.430> make

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
that on purpose because I wanted to make

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.319 
that on purpose because I wanted to make
sure<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:56.469> have<00:00:56.860> places<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.370> fiddle<00:00:58.180> with

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
sure that I have places to fiddle with

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.780 
sure that I have places to fiddle with
this<00:00:58.660> in<00:00:58.899> screw<00:00:59.260> holes<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.920> all<00:01:00.430> different

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
this in screw holes and all different

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.280 
this in screw holes and all different
places<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.719> not<00:01:01.840> have<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.050> worry<00:01:02.200> about

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
places and not have to worry about

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.319 
places and not have to worry about
getting<00:01:02.980> down<00:01:03.250> into<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.520> water<00:01:03.730> flow<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.089> I

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
getting down into the water flow so I

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:05.910 
getting down into the water flow so I
just<00:01:04.600> made<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:04.960> deeper<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.350> that's<00:01:05.619> probably

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
just made it deeper and that's probably

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.529 
just made it deeper and that's probably
a<00:01:06.040> little<00:01:06.159> industrial<00:01:06.850> for<00:01:07.030> what<00:01:07.149> we're<00:01:07.299> doing

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
a little industrial for what we're doing

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.489 
a little industrial for what we're doing
but<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:09.009> is<00:01:09.420> gonna<00:01:10.420> be<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.780> mo<00:01:11.139> for<00:01:11.380> this

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
but that is gonna be the mo for this

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:14.429 
but that is gonna be the mo for this
whole<00:01:11.679> thing<00:01:11.920> probably<00:01:12.359> for<00:01:13.359> now<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.380> don't

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
whole thing probably for now and I don't

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.489 
whole thing probably for now and I don't
love<00:01:14.829> these<00:01:15.189> but<00:01:15.819> the<00:01:15.939> legs<00:01:16.209> are<00:01:16.569> 1<00:01:17.319> inch

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
love these but the legs are 1 inch

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.120 
love these but the legs are 1 inch
conduit<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:20.259> have<00:01:20.619> them<00:01:20.770> held<00:01:20.979> together

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
conduit and I have them held together

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.129 
conduit and I have them held together
with<00:01:21.399> u-bolts<00:01:22.029> and<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.209> have<00:01:22.299> 30<00:01:22.569> inch<00:01:22.719> legs<00:01:22.959> in

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:23.139 
with u-bolts and I have 30 inch legs in

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:26.730 
with u-bolts and I have 30 inch legs in
the<00:01:23.229> back<00:01:23.259> 24<00:01:24.189> inch<00:01:24.399> legs<00:01:24.670> in<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.939> front<00:01:25.740> my

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
the back 24 inch legs in the front my

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.279 
the back 24 inch legs in the front my
thinking<00:01:27.219> there<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.520> if<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.479> put<00:01:28.779> it<00:01:28.899> straight

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
thinking there is if I put it straight

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.769 
thinking there is if I put it straight
at<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.560> top<00:01:29.799> of<00:01:30.130> those<00:01:31.859> they<00:01:33.420> I'll<00:01:34.420> have<00:01:34.630> my

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:34.779 
at the top of those they I'll have my

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:36.959 
at the top of those they I'll have my
pitch<00:01:35.079> pretty<00:01:35.799> well<00:01:36.009> set<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.520> wanted<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.849> to

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
pitch pretty well set and I wanted it to

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.730 
pitch pretty well set and I wanted it to
be<00:01:37.060> tall<00:01:37.299> enough<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.719> I<00:01:37.810> could<00:01:37.869> fit<00:01:38.709> a

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
be tall enough that I could fit a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.199 
be tall enough that I could fit a
five-gallon<00:01:39.219> bucket<00:01:39.459> on<00:01:39.549> it<00:01:39.670> like<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:39.969> like

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
five-gallon bucket on it like that like

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.469 
five-gallon bucket on it like that like
you<00:01:40.329> see<00:01:40.479> there<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:41.289> was<00:01:41.740> part<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.099> the<00:01:42.479> idea

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
you see there that was part of the idea

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.029 
you see there that was part of the idea
if<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:43.719> want<00:01:43.899> to<00:01:43.959> do<00:01:44.049> some<00:01:44.229> testing<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.740> how<00:01:44.920> I'm

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
if I want to do some testing on how I'm

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.120 
if I want to do some testing on how I'm
catching<00:01:45.429> or<00:01:45.579> losing<00:01:45.969> gold<00:01:46.119> I<00:01:46.389> can<00:01:47.289> do<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.560> I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
catching or losing gold I can do that I

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.760 
catching or losing gold I can do that I
think<00:01:48.609> that<00:01:49.419> what<00:01:49.779> I'm<00:01:49.899> gonna<00:01:50.109> wind<00:01:50.380> up<00:01:50.560> doing

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
think that what I'm gonna wind up doing

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.039 
think that what I'm gonna wind up doing
is<00:01:51.189> taking<00:01:51.279> a<00:01:51.969> pipe<00:01:52.179> bender<00:01:52.569> and<00:01:52.779> bending

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
is taking a pipe bender and bending

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.349 
is taking a pipe bender and bending
built<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.919> bottom<00:01:54.249> four<00:01:54.490> inches<00:01:54.789> those<00:01:55.060> legs

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
built the bottom four inches those legs

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.419 
built the bottom four inches those legs
out<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:56.499> that<00:01:56.679> they'll<00:01:56.829> be<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.009> little<00:01:57.219> more

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
out so that they'll be a little more

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.969 
out so that they'll be a little more
stable<00:01:57.789> front<00:01:58.569> and<00:01:58.689> back

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
stable front and back

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.629 
stable front and back
that's<00:02:00.429> just<00:02:00.639> my<00:02:00.759> idea<00:02:01.090> we<00:02:01.329> took<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:03.159> sluice

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
that's just my idea we took the sluice

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.479 
that's just my idea we took the sluice
itself<00:02:04.419> is<00:02:04.659> made<00:02:04.869> out<00:02:04.899> of<00:02:05.049> Oh<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.409> toe<00:02:05.679> aluminum

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
itself is made out of Oh a toe aluminum

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:13.530 
itself is made out of Oh a toe aluminum
and<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:08.140> matting<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:11.730> starts<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> back<00:02:13.240> I'm

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and my matting is starts in the back I'm

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
and my matting is starts in the back I'm
going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.810> actually

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
going to actually

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.630 
going to actually
put<00:02:14.940> underneath<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.860> clamp<00:02:17.860> which<00:02:18.130> again<00:02:18.430> is

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
put underneath that clamp which again is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.370 
put underneath that clamp which again is
a<00:02:18.670> little<00:02:18.910> industrial<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:19.810> underneath<00:02:20.110> that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
a little industrial but underneath that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.059 
a little industrial but underneath that
clamp<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:20.890> gonna<00:02:21.010> put<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.810> are<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.860> then<00:02:23.980> we

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
clamp I'm gonna put you are and then we

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.870 
clamp I'm gonna put you are and then we
have<00:02:24.099> scrubber<00:02:24.989> razor<00:02:25.989> back<00:02:26.520> scrubber<00:02:27.520> and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
have scrubber razor back scrubber and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.690 
have scrubber razor back scrubber and
then<00:02:28.660> Razorback<00:02:29.349> razor<00:02:29.709> back<00:02:30.040> Razorback

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
then Razorback razor back Razorback

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.949 
then Razorback razor back Razorback
razor<00:02:31.060> back<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.780> then<00:02:32.670> scrubber<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:34.840> it

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
razor back and then scrubber and then it

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.449 
razor back and then scrubber and then it
ends<00:02:35.200> with<00:02:35.319> some<00:02:35.500> Razorback<00:02:35.980> down<00:02:36.190> here<00:02:36.400> at

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
ends with some Razorback down here at

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.240 
ends with some Razorback down here at
the<00:02:36.519> bottom<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.870> that's<00:02:38.050> how<00:02:38.920> we're<00:02:39.099> going<00:02:39.190> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the bottom and that's how we're going to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.780 
the bottom and that's how we're going to
try<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.610> out<00:02:41.160> again<00:02:42.160> I'm<00:02:42.310> going<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.459> tinker

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
try this out again I'm going to tinker

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.690 
try this out again I'm going to tinker
with<00:02:42.849> that<00:02:43.150> no<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.870> legs<00:02:44.769> for<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> hopper

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
with that no the the legs for the hopper

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.360 
with that no the the legs for the hopper
are<00:02:46.049> steel<00:02:47.049> they're<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.590> aluminum<00:02:48.130> and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
are steel they're not aluminum and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.460 
are steel they're not aluminum and
they're<00:02:48.880> heavy<00:02:49.390> as<00:02:49.480> all<00:02:49.660> get-out<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.290> don't

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
they're heavy as all get-out but I don't

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.430 
they're heavy as all get-out but I don't
have<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.680> pack<00:02:50.890> very<00:02:51.190> far<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:52.660> hopper<00:02:53.170> that

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
have to pack very far so the hopper that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.729 
have to pack very far so the hopper that
we<00:02:53.799> made<00:02:54.540> by<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.600> way<00:02:55.840> something<00:02:56.230> else<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.650> I

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
we made by the way something else that I

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.370 
we made by the way something else that I
wanted<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.069> throw<00:02:57.730> out<00:02:57.970> on<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.569> I<00:02:58.720> made<00:02:59.349> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
wanted to throw out on this is I made a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.100 
wanted to throw out on this is I made a
flair<00:02:59.860> for<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.940> sluice<00:03:01.239> as<00:03:01.420> well<00:03:01.630> because<00:03:01.930> my

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
flair for the sluice as well because my

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.900 
flair for the sluice as well because my
thinking<00:03:02.530> was<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:02.739> might<00:03:03.040> want<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.610> double

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
thinking was I might want this to double

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.120 
thinking was I might want this to double
as<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> river<00:03:04.780> stream<00:03:04.989> sluice<00:03:05.500> which<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:05.890> a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
as a river stream sluice which it's a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.670 
as a river stream sluice which it's a
little<00:03:06.640> big<00:03:06.849> for<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.330> but<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:07.870> wanted<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.560> have

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
little big for that but I wanted to have

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.190 
little big for that but I wanted to have
that<00:03:08.830> potential<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:09.940> have<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.540> where<00:03:11.170> I

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
that potential so I have that where I

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.559 
that potential so I have that where I
can<00:03:11.410> take<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:11.830> off<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.549> throw<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.269> flare<00:03:13.540> on

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
can take this off and throw the flare on

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.940 
can take this off and throw the flare on
and<00:03:13.989> put<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.560> creek<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.680> legs

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
and put it in the creek but the the legs

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.000 
and put it in the creek but the the legs
on<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.220> hopper<00:03:18.549> or<00:03:18.700> steel<00:03:19.560> not<00:03:20.560> worried<00:03:20.890> about

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
on the hopper or steel not worried about

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.340 
on the hopper or steel not worried about
them<00:03:21.250> breaking<00:03:21.430> they're<00:03:22.150> plenty<00:03:22.630> strong<00:03:22.840> so

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
them breaking they're plenty strong so

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.319 
them breaking they're plenty strong so
my<00:03:24.040> hopper<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:27.269> owned<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.720> know<00:03:28.780> aluminum<00:03:29.530> and

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
my hopper is owned I know aluminum and

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.750 
my hopper is owned I know aluminum and
what<00:03:31.329> we<00:03:31.450> did<00:03:31.720> with<00:03:31.959> this<00:03:32.230> was<00:03:32.620> we<00:03:32.950> took<00:03:33.130> one

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
what we did with this was we took one

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.479 
what we did with this was we took one
sheet<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.720> bent<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:35.950> we<00:03:36.160> didn't

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
sheet and and bent it and so we didn't

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.000 
sheet and and bent it and so we didn't
cut<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.510> there's<00:03:37.810> no<00:03:37.959> seams<00:03:38.319> in<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.620> bottom

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
cut that there's no seams in the bottom

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.509 
cut that there's no seams in the bottom
I<00:03:39.069> didn't<00:03:39.250> want<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.549> leak<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:41.200> got<00:03:41.859> some<00:03:42.400> of

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
I didn't want to leak and I got some of

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.539 
I didn't want to leak and I got some of
this<00:03:42.640> idea<00:03:43.030> obviously<00:03:43.299> from<00:03:43.900> gold<00:03:44.530> hog<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:45.100> got

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
this idea obviously from gold hog I got

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.180 
this idea obviously from gold hog I got
another<00:03:45.819> there's<00:03:46.299> another<00:03:46.359> guy<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:48.040> You

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
another there's another guy on the You

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.330 
another there's another guy on the You
Tube<00:03:48.220> John<00:03:48.790> Jacobs<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:50.440> very<00:03:50.799> similar<00:03:51.190> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
Tube John Jacobs this very similar to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.009 
Tube John Jacobs this very similar to
his<00:03:51.519> hopper<00:03:51.880> design<00:03:52.209> because<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.569> really<00:03:52.810> liked

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
his hopper design because I really liked

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.629 
his hopper design because I really liked
it<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.459> 12<00:03:55.329> inches<00:03:55.690> high<00:03:56.340> 10<00:03:57.340> inches

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
it and so it is 12 inches high 10 inches

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.420 
it and so it is 12 inches high 10 inches
wide<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:58.239> 24<00:03:58.780> inches<00:03:59.170> long<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.739> I<00:03:59.920> have<00:04:00.130> inch

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
wide and 24 inches long and I have inch

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.870 
wide and 24 inches long and I have inch
and<00:04:00.609> a<00:04:00.670> half<00:04:00.700> feed<00:04:01.239> into<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.139> and<00:04:02.739> then<00:04:03.549> we<00:04:03.670> took

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
and a half feed into it and then we took

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.879 
and a half feed into it and then we took
just<00:04:04.180> extra<00:04:04.630> strips<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.260> aluminum<00:04:05.739> that

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
just extra strips of the aluminum that

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.280 
just extra strips of the aluminum that
we<00:04:06.010> already<00:04:06.190> were<00:04:06.489> using<00:04:06.970> some<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.959> extra

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
we already were using some of the extra

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.740 
we already were using some of the extra
scrap<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.829> we<00:04:08.950> bent<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.700> riveted<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.630> in

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
scrap and we bent it and riveted it in

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.620 
scrap and we bent it and riveted it in
place<00:04:10.989> there<00:04:11.380> on<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.650> corners<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.639> that

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
place there on the corners and that

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.909 
place there on the corners and that
allows<00:04:13.989> us<00:04:14.019> to<00:04:16.200> seal<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.289> up<00:04:17.440> real<00:04:17.709> nice<00:04:17.889> and

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
allows us to seal that up real nice and

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.960 
allows us to seal that up real nice and
man<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.400> came<00:04:18.519> together<00:04:18.669> great<00:04:20.250> then<00:04:21.250> built

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
man it came together great then built

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.140 
man it came together great then built
the<00:04:22.120> back<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.599> course<00:04:23.490> inch<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.669> a<00:04:24.700> half<00:04:24.729> feet

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
the back of course inch and a half feet

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.140 
the back of course inch and a half feet
in<00:04:25.419> my<00:04:26.200> Grizzly

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
in my Grizzly

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.180 
in my Grizzly
steel<00:04:28.690> rods<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.350> reason<00:04:29.680> we<00:04:29.770> used<00:04:30.010> this

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
steel rods and the reason we used this

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.410 
steel rods and the reason we used this
is<00:04:30.370> because<00:04:30.580> we<00:04:30.700> had<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:33.400> was<00:04:33.580> land<00:04:33.820> laying

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
is because we had it it was land laying

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.420 
is because we had it it was land laying
around<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:35.080> we<00:04:35.230> welded<00:04:35.800> this<00:04:35.920> up<00:04:36.100> real<00:04:36.280> quick

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
around so we welded this up real quick

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.940 
around so we welded this up real quick
we<00:04:36.520> put<00:04:36.670> a<00:04:36.700> support<00:04:37.210> bar<00:04:37.420> across<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.470> back<00:04:38.650> and

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
we put a support bar across the back and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.670 
we put a support bar across the back and
and<00:04:39.100> when<00:04:39.340> this<00:04:39.490> thing<00:04:39.700> is<00:04:39.730> raised<00:04:40.060> up<00:04:40.300> right

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
and when this thing is raised up right

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.070 
and when this thing is raised up right
that<00:04:41.680> support<00:04:42.340> bar<00:04:42.520> sits<00:04:43.030> flush<00:04:43.480> right<00:04:43.870> on

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
that support bar sits flush right on

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.220 
that support bar sits flush right on
right<00:04:44.530> just<00:04:45.010> on<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.970> edge<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.840> back<00:04:46.990> edge

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
right just on that edge of the back edge

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.940 
right just on that edge of the back edge
of<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:48.720> sluice<00:04:49.720> box<00:04:49.960> so<00:04:50.110> I'm<00:04:50.200> curious<00:04:50.620> if

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
of that sluice box so I'm curious if

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.510 
of that sluice box so I'm curious if
that's<00:04:51.160> gonna<00:04:52.440> cause<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.470> problem<00:04:53.590> or<00:04:54.130> not<00:04:54.220> we

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
that's gonna cause a problem or not we

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.020 
that's gonna cause a problem or not we
may<00:04:54.700> wind<00:04:54.970> up<00:04:55.120> modifying<00:04:56.110> that<00:04:56.550> as<00:04:57.550> we<00:04:57.790> tinker

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
may wind up modifying that as we tinker

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.870 
may wind up modifying that as we tinker
along<00:04:58.470> these<00:04:59.470> little<00:05:00.070> brackets<00:05:00.520> right<00:05:00.670> here

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
along these little brackets right here

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.660 
along these little brackets right here
are<00:05:01.150> just<00:05:01.860> extra<00:05:02.860> scraps<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.250> we<00:05:03.400> have<00:05:03.550> as

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
are just extra scraps that we have as

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.520 
are just extra scraps that we have as
well<00:05:03.850> we<00:05:03.970> folded<00:05:04.330> them<00:05:04.480> over<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.990> thing

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
well we folded them over the thing

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.140 
well we folded them over the thing
riveted<00:05:05.950> them<00:05:06.070> in<00:05:06.190> place<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:06.970> it's

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
riveted them in place and and it's

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.480 
riveted them in place and and it's
really<00:05:07.210> strong<00:05:07.930> now<00:05:08.440> inside<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:09.040> box<00:05:09.220> I

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
really strong now inside the box I

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.610 
really strong now inside the box I
wanted<00:05:09.760> to<00:05:09.880> show<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.960> get<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.230> guys<00:05:11.410> his

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
wanted to show this and get you guys his

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.530 
wanted to show this and get you guys his
feedback<00:05:11.890> on<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:14.020> we<00:05:14.800> we<00:05:15.640> bent<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.150> whole

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
feedback on it so we we bent that whole

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.760 
feedback on it so we we bent that whole
edge<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.080> when<00:05:17.230> we<00:05:17.350> cut<00:05:17.620> it<00:05:17.770> out<00:05:17.920> I<00:05:18.160> left<00:05:19.770> that

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
edge and when we cut it out I left that

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.990 
edge and when we cut it out I left that
I<00:05:21.010> don't<00:05:21.160> know<00:05:21.220> if<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.370> can<00:05:21.490> see<00:05:21.670> it<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:21.850> here

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
I don't know if you can see it in here

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.580 
I don't know if you can see it in here
real<00:05:22.150> good<00:05:22.300> but<00:05:22.450> there's<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.750> strip<00:05:23.200> along<00:05:23.530> the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
real good but there's a strip along the

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.260 
real good but there's a strip along the
back<00:05:23.920> let<00:05:24.160> me<00:05:24.250> get<00:05:24.400> underneath<00:05:24.640> here<00:05:24.970> and<00:05:25.060> show

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
back let me get underneath here and show

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.560 
back let me get underneath here and show
you<00:05:25.480> there's<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.530> strip<00:05:27.190> that<00:05:27.790> actually<00:05:28.390> is<00:05:28.540> a

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
you there's a strip that actually is a

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.870 
you there's a strip that actually is a
part<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.140> box<00:05:29.410> that's<00:05:30.310> underneath<00:05:30.640> the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
part of the box that's underneath the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.910 
part of the box that's underneath the
Grizzly<00:05:31.270> there<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:31.750> so<00:05:32.170> the<00:05:32.290> Grizzly<00:05:32.590> rests

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
Grizzly there and so the Grizzly rests

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.590 
Grizzly there and so the Grizzly rests
on<00:05:33.010> top<00:05:33.280> of<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.760> then<00:05:33.880> bolts<00:05:34.270> up

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
on top of that and then bolts up

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.980 
on top of that and then bolts up
underneath<00:05:35.290> on<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.920> front<00:05:36.510> but<00:05:37.510> I<00:05:37.540> that's

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
underneath on the front but I that's

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.390 
underneath on the front but I that's
there<00:05:38.260> for<00:05:38.530> strength

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
there for strength

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.060 
there for strength
it's<00:05:39.700> about<00:05:39.940> 5/8<00:05:40.510> just<00:05:41.380> for<00:05:41.590> strength<00:05:41.830> of<00:05:41.980> the

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
it's about 5/8 just for strength of the

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.100 
it's about 5/8 just for strength of the
box<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:42.670> doesn't<00:05:43.090> wobble<00:05:43.240> as<00:05:43.540> much<00:05:43.780> when<00:05:43.990> I'm

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
box and doesn't wobble as much when I'm

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.710 
box and doesn't wobble as much when I'm
moving<00:05:44.980> it<00:05:45.100> around<00:05:45.220> but<00:05:45.820> it<00:05:46.210> also<00:05:46.360> supports

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
moving it around but it also supports

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.140 
moving it around but it also supports
that<00:05:47.170> grizzly<00:05:47.560> as<00:05:47.740> well<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:48.640> then<00:05:48.790> on<00:05:48.970> the

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
that grizzly as well and then on the

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.870 
that grizzly as well and then on the
sides<00:05:49.510> we<00:05:50.290> left<00:05:50.650> about<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:51.010> quarter<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.610> an<00:05:51.730> inch

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
sides we left about a quarter of an inch

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.160 
sides we left about a quarter of an inch
of<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.480> band<00:05:52.750> in<00:05:52.990> and<00:05:54.510> just<00:05:55.510> just<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:55.900> make<00:05:56.050> it

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
of the band in and just just to make it

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.480 
of the band in and just just to make it
more<00:05:56.260> sturdy<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:56.620> I'm<00:05:56.860> curious<00:05:57.250> about

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
more sturdy and I'm curious about

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.320 
more sturdy and I'm curious about
whether<00:05:57.970> or<00:05:58.150> not<00:05:58.270> that<00:05:58.660> is<00:05:58.930> going<00:05:59.290> to<00:06:00.330> catch

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
whether or not that is going to catch

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.500 
whether or not that is going to catch
dirt<00:06:02.140> I<00:06:02.470> don't<00:06:03.340> think<00:06:03.610> it<00:06:03.730> will<00:06:03.850> but<00:06:04.180> we'll<00:06:04.390> you

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
dirt I don't think it will but we'll you

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.670 
dirt I don't think it will but we'll you
know<00:06:04.570> we'll<00:06:04.750> find<00:06:04.990> out<00:06:05.170> and<00:06:05.350> if<00:06:05.440> it's<00:06:05.590> a

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
know we'll find out and if it's a

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.120
