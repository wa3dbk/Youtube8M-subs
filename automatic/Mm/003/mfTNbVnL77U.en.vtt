00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.089 

take<00:02:44.490> another<00:02:44.760> look<00:02:45.000> from<00:02:45.270> another<00:02:45.540> angle

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
maybe the 30 car michael waltrip didn't

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.050 
maybe the 30 car michael waltrip didn't
get<00:02:54.379> off<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.560> quite<00:02:55.129> as<00:02:55.249> good<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> start<00:02:55.700> as<00:02:55.819> mark

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
get off to quite as good a start as mark

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.509 
get off to quite as good a start as mark
thought<00:02:56.269> he<00:02:56.389> would<00:02:56.540> or<00:02:56.749> something<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.519> maybe

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
thought he would or something and maybe

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.550 
thought he would or something and maybe
you<00:02:58.639> have<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.849> look<00:02:58.879> from<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.299> PL<00:02:59.780> overhead

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
you have to look from the PL overhead

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.550 
you have to look from the PL overhead
maybe<00:03:00.859> give<00:03:01.069> us<00:03:01.099> a<00:03:01.310> better<00:03:01.489> perspective<00:03:01.849> here

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
maybe give us a better perspective here
