palette<00:00:33.220> so<00:00:34.220> I<00:00:34.250> thought<00:00:34.610> I<00:00:34.640> would<00:00:34.820> do<00:00:35.090> that

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
palette so I thought I would do that

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.680 
palette so I thought I would do that
with<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.540> door<00:00:35.750> this<00:00:36.080> time<00:00:36.140> instead<00:00:36.830> of<00:00:36.890> doing

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
with the door this time instead of doing

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.330 
with the door this time instead of doing
something<00:00:38.690> with<00:00:38.810> deco<00:00:39.020> mesh<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.620> changed<00:00:40.070> it<00:00:40.220> up

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
something with deco mesh I changed it up

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.240 
something with deco mesh I changed it up
and<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:41.030> kind<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.420> more<00:00:42.230> organic<00:00:42.770> woodsy

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
and it's kind of more organic woodsy

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and it's kind of more organic woodsy

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290

and<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.090> coleus<00:03:16.450> plant<00:03:16.720> works<00:03:17.380> really<00:03:17.650> well

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
and the coleus plant works really well

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.670 
and the coleus plant works really well
and<00:03:18.780> withstands<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.900> heat<00:03:20.140> most<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.620> the
