00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.990 

looking<00:00:39.360> over<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:40.130> there<00:00:41.130> was<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.310> log<00:00:41.580> here

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
looking over here there was a log here

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.670 
looking over here there was a log here
that<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.510> been<00:00:42.890> rotted

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
that had been rotted

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.380 
that had been rotted
and<00:00:44.770> that<00:00:44.980> log<00:00:45.250> has<00:00:45.460> been<00:00:45.490> replaced

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
and that log has been replaced

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.930 
and that log has been replaced
carotids<00:00:48.079> lon<00:00:48.620> there

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.370 

we<00:00:51.090> could<00:00:51.240> see<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> hole<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.960> end<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
we could see the hole in the end of it

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.400 
we could see the hole in the end of it
but<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> rod<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.250> much<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.760> substantial<00:00:54.540> in

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
but the rod is much more substantial in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.400 
but the rod is much more substantial in
other<00:00:55.590> places

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
other places

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.610 
other places
so<00:00:57.950> all<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.610> this<00:00:58.730> paint<00:00:59.060> is<00:00:59.270> coming<00:00:59.450> off<00:00:59.720> now

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
so all of this paint is coming off now

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.230 
so all of this paint is coming off now
there<00:01:00.950> were<00:01:01.040> some<00:01:01.220> choices<00:01:01.520> as<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:01.910> how<00:01:02.180> to

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
there were some choices as to how to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.320 
there were some choices as to how to
remove<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.780> paint<00:01:03.400> one<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.640> choices<00:01:04.880> was

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
remove the paint one of the choices was

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.380 
remove the paint one of the choices was
to<00:01:05.540> go<00:01:05.690> through<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.350> remove<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.460> by<00:01:07.700> using

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
to go through and remove it by using

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.540 
to go through and remove it by using
sanding<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.380> grinding<00:01:09.980> and<00:01:10.100> things<00:01:10.370> like

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
sanding and grinding and things like

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.450 
sanding and grinding and things like
that<00:01:10.790> but<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.090> would<00:01:11.360> have<00:01:11.450> taken

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
that but that would have taken

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.490 
that but that would have taken
approximately<00:01:13.460> thirty<00:01:14.420> seven<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:15.080> forty

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
approximately thirty seven to forty

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.450 
approximately thirty seven to forty
seven<00:01:15.890> weeks<00:01:16.160> worth<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.700> work<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:19.190> cost

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
seven weeks worth of work and the cost

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.330 
seven weeks worth of work and the cost
was<00:01:19.700> outrageous<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.260> that's<00:01:21.590> obviously<00:01:22.040> not

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
was outrageous and that's obviously not

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.310 
was outrageous and that's obviously not
the<00:01:22.370> way<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.670> go<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:23.690> there<00:01:23.810> had<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:23.960> be<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.140> more

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
the way to go so there had to be a more

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.070 
the way to go so there had to be a more
efficient<00:01:24.800> way<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.250> what's<00:01:26.180> being<00:01:26.390> done<00:01:26.780> and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
efficient way so what's being done and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:55.910 
efficient way so what's being done and
I'll<00:01:27.560> show<00:01:27.800> you<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.070> over<00:01:28.130> here

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
can you stand because sandals

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.370 
can you stand because sandals
would<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.580> corncob

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
would the corncob

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.809 
would the corncob
take<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.159> pain<00:02:07.399> off<00:02:07.579> without<00:02:07.850> destroyed

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819

inside<00:03:21.540> where<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> electrical<00:03:22.470> wires<00:03:22.680> run

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
inside where the electrical wires run

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.949 
inside where the electrical wires run
well<00:03:25.319> behind<00:03:25.620> there<00:03:26.330> without<00:03:27.330> disrupting<00:03:27.750> the

well behind there without disrupting the
waters<00:03:29.209> they<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.390> really<00:03:30.540> target<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.170> thing

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
waters they can really target that thing

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.260 
corncob blasting is that it comes
through<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.970> ceilings<00:04:29.490> through<00:04:30.490> right<00:04:31.090> up
