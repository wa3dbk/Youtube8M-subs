00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:22.113
 This is a Saber Strike 2014 exercise 

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:27.473
 [Captain James Walton] This is the third time that international partners are practicing together. 

00:00:27.473 --> 00:00:32.833
 This year, over 4,000 soldiers from over ten countries will participate in the exercise. 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:43.836
 Different countries can work together on diverse collaborations with different performance, 

00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:48.116
 where we can improve our interoperability. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.957
 This is an important exercise for all our international partners 

00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:55.857
 In the Baltic and European region 

00:00:55.857 --> 00:01:00.997
 because it gives us the opportunity to strengthen our cooperation 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.480
 practicing together in field conditions and staff level. 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.580
 The exercise consists of three different exercises: 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.500
 [Captain Ilkka MÃ¤ki-Ullakko] Exercises for Squadron, Terrain and Air 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 Finland participates in head coaching 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.660
 as part of the battalion's staff. 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:36.400
 The Department is also supported by the Finnish International Standby Force Communications and Headquarters unit. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:47.220
 Exercise improves operational capability of participating troops, battalion staff, and messaging and staffing 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.100
 but also with other forces. 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.140
 For staff working with senior staffs and adjacent forces 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:16.460
 Commanders and messengers for operation and practice with foreign soldiers. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:27.020
 An individual warrior gets experience working with foreign soldiers 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.700
 This experience will benefit them if they participate in international operations in the future. 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.280
 In addition to working with a Finnish mechanized icebreaker battalion 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.200
 I was able to follow the activities of the Finnish military police department 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.360
 I believe this exercise has been a valuable experience for them in preparing for international operations 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.840
 In addition to their head training, they performed security and military police tasks, 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.240
 who also contribute to the ability to participate in real operations. 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.680
 The Finnish Battalion has been an integral part of the exercise and 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.380
 we hope to see them again next year.
