from offensive rebounds you got a big
boost<00:04:44.659> there<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.139> that's<00:04:45.289> another<00:04:45.560> one<00:04:45.770> that

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
boost there so that's another one that

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.409 
boost there so that's another one that
you<00:04:45.949> might<00:04:46.189> consider<00:04:46.370> for<00:04:46.729> a<00:04:46.759> big<00:04:46.969> guy<00:04:47.180> in

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
you might consider for a big guy in

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.899 
you might consider for a big guy in
particular<00:04:47.680> floor<00:04:48.680> general<00:04:49.129> make<00:04:49.759> your

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
particular floor general make your

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.219 
particular floor general make your
teammates<00:04:50.240> better<00:04:50.389> offensively<00:04:50.990> while

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
teammates better offensively while

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.290 
teammates better offensively while
you're<00:04:51.349> on<00:04:51.439> the<00:04:51.530> court<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:52.340> get<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.819> attribute

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
you're on the court you get to attribute

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.709 
you're on the court you get to attribute
points<00:04:53.689> to<00:04:54.379> your<00:04:54.530> offensive<00:04:55.099> abilities<00:04:55.719> for

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
points to your offensive abilities for

points to your offensive abilities for
your<00:04:56.810> teammates<00:04:57.199> so<00:04:57.469> that's<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.830> good<00:04:57.979> thing

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
your teammates so that's a good thing

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.040 
your teammates so that's a good thing
you<00:04:58.370> really<00:04:58.610> help<00:04:58.789> your<00:04:58.879> teammates<00:04:59.240> out<00:04:59.449> not<00:05:00.020> a

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
you really help your teammates out not a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.629 
you really help your teammates out not a
huge<00:05:00.319> boost<00:05:00.529> but<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.860> might<00:05:01.009> be<00:05:01.159> worth<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.520> if

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
huge boost but it might be worth it if

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.100 
huge boost but it might be worth it if
you<00:05:01.669> are<00:05:01.879> a<00:05:01.939> guy<00:05:02.090> that<00:05:02.270> likes<00:05:02.449> to<00:05:02.539> run<00:05:02.750> his<00:05:02.779> team

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
you are a guy that likes to run his team

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.809 
you are a guy that likes to run his team
and<00:05:03.349> really<00:05:03.830> set<00:05:04.039> his<00:05:04.159> teammates<00:05:04.490> up<00:05:04.639> for<00:05:04.789> a

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
and really set his teammates up for a

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.260 
and really set his teammates up for a
score<00:05:05.680> now<00:05:06.680> that<00:05:07.009> concludes<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.699> offensive

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
score now that concludes the offensive

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.240 
score now that concludes the offensive

signature skills I have done the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.040 
signature skills I have done the
offensive<00:05:10.729> and<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:10.969> defensive<00:05:11.050> signature

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
offensive and the defensive signature

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.439 
offensive and the defensive signature
skills<00:05:12.319> the<00:05:12.800> ones<00:05:13.009> that<00:05:13.159> I<00:05:13.189> got<00:05:13.279> so<00:05:13.909> far<00:05:14.180> are

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
skills the ones that I got so far are

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.740 
skills the ones that I got so far are
the<00:05:15.379> poster<00:05:15.770> Iser<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.580> finisher<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.270> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
the poster Iser the finisher and the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.129 
the poster Iser the finisher and the
dimer<00:05:18.080> on<00:05:18.409> offense<00:05:18.919> defense<00:05:19.669> I<00:05:20.330> am<00:05:20.779> thinking

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
dimer on offense defense I am thinking

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.459 
dimer on offense defense I am thinking
of<00:05:21.229> getting<00:05:21.409> the<00:05:21.620> lockdown<00:05:22.039> defender<00:05:22.490> and

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
of getting the lockdown defender and

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.230 
of getting the lockdown defender and
possibly<00:05:24.469> another<00:05:25.340> one<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:25.759> we're<00:05:25.879> gonna<00:05:25.969> see

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
possibly another one so we're gonna see

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.089 
possibly another one so we're gonna see
what<00:05:26.270> those<00:05:26.569> end<00:05:26.900> up<00:05:27.020> being<00:05:27.080> these<00:05:27.800> are<00:05:27.979> my

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
what those end up being these are my

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.860 
what those end up being these are my
suggestions<00:05:28.520> for<00:05:28.699> offense<00:05:29.210> remember<00:05:29.569> I'm<00:05:29.750> an

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
suggestions for offense remember I'm an

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.119 
suggestions for offense remember I'm an
all-around<00:05:30.139> point<00:05:30.440> guard<00:05:30.650> so<00:05:30.800> that's<00:05:30.949> what<00:05:31.099> I

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
all-around point guard so that's what I

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.600 
all-around point guard so that's what I
picked

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
picked

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.399
