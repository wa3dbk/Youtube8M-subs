the princess is required to produce IRB

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.320 
the princess is required to produce IRB
blue-steel<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:04.049> complex<00:00:04.640> the<00:00:05.640> steel<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:06.180> his

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
blue-steel a complex the steel with his

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.810 
blue-steel a complex the steel with his
high<00:00:06.600> carbon<00:00:07.319> content<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.040> very<00:00:08.340> brittle

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
high carbon content can be very brittle

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
high carbon content can be very brittle
and<00:00:08.940> so<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> tungsten<00:00:09.929> which<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.349> used<00:00:10.530> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
and so the tungsten which is used to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.730 
and so the tungsten which is used to
toughen<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> knife<00:00:11.599> creates<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.780> steel

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
toughen the knife creates a steel

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.070 
toughen the knife creates a steel
material<00:00:14.370> which<00:00:14.549> when<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.089> try<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.450> forge<00:00:15.809> it

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
material which when you try and forge it

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.230 
material which when you try and forge it
if<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.440> use<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.190> pressure<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> hand

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
if you use it on pressure on the hand

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.000 
if you use it on pressure on the hand
with<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> hammer<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.380> you'll<00:00:19.529> find<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
with the hammer what you'll find is that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.429 
with the hammer what you'll find is that
you'll<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.340> Micra<00:00:20.699> fractures<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:22.199> knife

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
you'll get Micra fractures so this knife

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
you'll get Micra fractures so this knife
