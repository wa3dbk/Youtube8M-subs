safer and another line of research is

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
safer and another line of research is
looking<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.950> those<00:01:11.070> emerging<00:01:11.729> pathogens<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
looking for those emerging pathogens and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.140 
looking for those emerging pathogens and
pathogens<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> horizon<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
pathogens that are on the horizon and so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.640 
pathogens that are on the horizon and so
what<00:01:15.330> we'll<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.900> we'll<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.350> where<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
what we'll do is we'll see where the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.469 
what we'll do is we'll see where the
source<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.490> we'll<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.210> become

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
source is and we'll see how they become

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.270 
source is and we'll see how they become
integrated<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> food<00:01:19.560> chain<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.159> how

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
integrated to the food chain and how

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340 
integrated to the food chain and how
they<00:01:20.460> end<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.820> our<00:01:20.939> food<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.869> by<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> time

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
they end up in our food so by the time

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
they end up in our food so by the time
it<00:01:22.500> gets<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> consumer<00:01:23.790> we've<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.630> less

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it gets to the consumer we've got less

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
it gets to the consumer we've got less
to<00:01:25.020> worry<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.830> had<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.310> hands<00:01:26.729> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to worry about I had my hands on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.770 
to worry about I had my hands on
something

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
something

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.330 
something
it's<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.140> important<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> something<00:01:29.190> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's very important and something that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's very important and something that
we<00:01:29.580> are<00:01:29.790> seeing<00:01:30.420> outside<00:01:30.750> without<00:01:31.500> breaks<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
we are seeing outside without breaks and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.090 
we are seeing outside without breaks and
I<00:01:33.000> think<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.600> job<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.080> extremely<00:01:34.260> important

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I think this job is extremely important

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.359 
I think this job is extremely important
because<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.940> can<00:01:36.180> manage<00:01:36.770> how<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.090> improve

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
because you can manage how to improve

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.460 
because you can manage how to improve

Listeria and Salmonella outbreaks so you

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.190 
Listeria and Salmonella outbreaks so you
can<00:01:52.280> make<00:01:52.460> an<00:01:52.580> impact<00:01:52.940> on<00:01:53.210> people's<00:01:53.720> lives

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
speed revising technologies or even

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.450 
speed revising technologies or even
giving<00:01:57.200> them<00:01:57.320> information<00:01:57.470> when<00:01:58.070> an<00:01:58.159> outbreak

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
giving them information when an outbreak

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.880 
giving them information when an outbreak
occurs<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.659> being<00:02:00.020> able<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.200> translate<00:02:00.590> that
