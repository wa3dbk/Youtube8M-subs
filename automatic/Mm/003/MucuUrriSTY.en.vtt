00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
separately the mh8 - what we can do

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.450 
separately the mh8 - what we can do
therefore<00:00:48.210> basically<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.780> during<00:00:49.050> our<00:00:49.140> dive

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
therefore basically is during our dive

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.140 
therefore basically is during our dive
be<00:00:50.460> swimming<00:00:50.909> with<00:00:51.059> our<00:00:51.510> jism<00:00:51.900> power<00:00:52.530> unit

speaking<00:00:54.589> through<00:00:55.589> our<00:00:56.040> wireless

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
speaking through our wireless

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
speaking through our wireless
communication<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.110> reason<00:00:58.500> we

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
communication but for some reason we

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.850 
communication but for some reason we
need<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.400> move<00:00:59.580> to<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.909> hardwired<00:01:00.390> system

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
need to move to the hardwired system

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.450 
need to move to the hardwired system
which<00:01:01.860> could<00:01:02.040> be<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.820> Alpha<00:01:03.809> Pro

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
which could be the Alpha Pro

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.940 
which could be the Alpha Pro
experimented<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.659> case<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.620> we'd<00:01:07.920> have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
experimented in this case all we'd have

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.620 
experimented in this case all we'd have
to<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:09.049> unplugged<00:01:10.549> or<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to do really is unplugged or just a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.000 
to do really is unplugged or just a
viewing<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:14.190> image<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.970> two-unit

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
viewing it or the image a two-unit

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.340 
viewing it or the image a two-unit
attached<00:01:17.010> part<00:01:17.340> actor<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:18.360> our<00:01:18.540> unit<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.200> we

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
attached part actor to our unit so we

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.850 
attached part actor to our unit so we
can<00:01:19.380> able<00:01:19.620> to<00:01:20.130> move<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:23.630> cable<00:01:24.630> version<00:01:25.170> in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can able to move to the cable version in

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
can able to move to the cable version in
this<00:01:25.979> case<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
this case all we have to do really is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.350 
this case all we have to do really is
make<00:01:28.320> sure<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.039> use<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.579> correct<00:01:29.939> side

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
make sure that we use the correct side

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.200 
make sure that we use the correct side
of<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:31.439> pants<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.070> they're<00:01:32.250> similar<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
of the pants because they're similar but

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
of the pants because they're similar but
you<00:01:33.359> see<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> decal<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:35.009> says

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you see that we have a decal which says

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
you see that we have a decal which says
cable<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.979> underwater<00:01:37.979> unit<00:01:38.820> obviously<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
cable and underwater unit obviously you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.380 
cable and underwater unit obviously you
attach<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.310> part<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> goes<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.060> your<00:01:42.149> mask

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
attach the part that goes to your mask

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.730 
attach the part that goes to your mask
as<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.469> underwater<00:01:43.890> unit<00:01:45.289> then<00:01:46.289> you<00:01:46.469> would<00:01:46.619> go

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
as the underwater unit then you would go

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
as the underwater unit then you would go
over<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.549> table<00:01:47.729> unit<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.329> case

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
over to your table unit in this case

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.800 
over to your table unit in this case
like<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> said<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.289> alpha<00:01:49.560> pro-lifer<00:01:50.189> exit

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
like I said the alpha pro-lifer exit

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.179 
like I said the alpha pro-lifer exit
clip<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:52.829> communicating

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
clip in and now you are communicating

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.690 
clip in and now you are communicating
with<00:01:53.609> the<00:01:54.119> alpha<00:01:54.479> unit<00:01:55.039> instead<00:01:56.039> if<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.399> want

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
with the alpha unit instead if you want

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.340 
with the alpha unit instead if you want
to<00:01:56.759> communicate<00:01:56.969> maybe<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> underwater

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to communicate maybe with the underwater

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.669 
to communicate maybe with the underwater
cell<00:01:58.920> phone<00:01:59.189> unit<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.929> again<00:02:01.259> have

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
cell phone unit all you do is again have

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.649 
cell phone unit all you do is again have
underwater<00:02:02.159> unity<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> water<00:02:02.909> unit<00:02:03.240> cable

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
underwater unity on the water unit cable

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.529 
underwater unity on the water unit cable
with<00:02:04.170> cable<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.030> bingo<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.380> now

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
with cable and bingo you are now

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.450 
with cable and bingo you are now
accepting<00:02:09.539> or<00:02:09.720> making<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.050> phone<00:02:10.200> call<00:02:10.460> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
accepting or making a phone call the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.309 
accepting or making a phone call the
image<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.660> tube<00:02:13.220> unit<00:02:14.220> 2<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.660> very<00:02:15.660> simple<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
image a tube unit 2 is very simple and

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.070 
image a tube unit 2 is very simple and
it<00:02:16.590> can

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
it can

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.260 
it can
 and<00:02:17.560> be<00:02:17.710> inserted<00:02:18.130> inside<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:19.060> helmet

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
 and be inserted inside the helmet

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.680 
 and be inserted inside the helmet
the<00:02:20.050> helmet<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.500> fact<00:02:20.800> has<00:02:21.160> slots<00:02:21.940> where

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
the helmet the fact has slots where

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.000 
the helmet the fact has slots where
basically<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.860> unit<00:02:24.160> gets<00:02:25.620> placed<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.860> inside

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
basically the unit gets placed it inside

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.090 
basically the unit gets placed it inside
and<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.330> basically<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.500> end<00:02:29.710> result

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
and this is basically the end result

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.060 
and this is basically the end result
once<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.610> job<00:02:30.820> is<00:02:31.060> done<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:32.290> see<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.920> you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
once the job is done you see that you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.440 
once the job is done you see that you
have<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.660> unit<00:02:35.020> with<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.560> cable<00:02:36.090> run<00:02:37.090> siding

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
have the unit with the cable run siding

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.810 
have the unit with the cable run siding
the<00:02:37.600> helmet<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.140> everything<00:02:38.590> set<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.010> at<00:02:39.670> this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
the helmet and everything set up at this

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.940 
the helmet and everything set up at this
point<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:40.540> said<00:02:40.720> before<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.620> simply

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
point like we said before we can simply
