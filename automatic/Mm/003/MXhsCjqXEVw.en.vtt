00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.190
 and then guys youtube all right 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.710
 you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.929
 good to go back, linen does not have to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 skate 3 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.330
 You're going to have a skeleton. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 This is my car that I rode this one. 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.369
 Team jeitÃ£o and these host passed 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.090
 are the guys who already music of three 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.880
 powerful in the same game decision 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.099
 and I'm actually going to say I will not talk 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.559
 A lot of skate 3 will tell you more about the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:39.480
 because I noticed in the videos that the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 I put two black hawks videos with 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.879
 10 minutes and it was a ten minutes 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 that lasted 15 minutes and was against 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.980
 the boat and a people were seeing more than 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.780
 find the copom hill in me because 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.800
 I think it 's a very big way 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.219
 So I'll talk if I put it on sale. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
 black ops online will have strike goes 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.350
 take about 10 minutes because it is the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.450
 duration of the game just because I 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.479
 How I'm throwing water in the right canteen 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 even only if I stay playing the miner 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.509
 of landing I put the first match a 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.840
 colloquium his second tenure not put 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.950
 type 1a 2a if someone prepared me and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.560
 I have to see this because 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.340
 I made a very good match was 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.789
 flawless match was not any brand 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.700
 of 50 for none was incredible only that I 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.039
 I have a problem, she does not like me. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.579
 I only see back in the team. 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.270
 is lying his death I saved it back 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.690
 soft 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.240
 a problem in time since the video 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.900
 so it's hard to put him in who 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.290
 He won once both so much love 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.000
 I got on a tip, I'll add 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.000
 on this bridge to see if I can see 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 she says that in game 2 to win 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 because if the friend could hear the sound 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.810
 has a hard day to lose only from 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.040
 get a continuous come university 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.820
 make this beauty idea was beautiful 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.730
 game and then skate 3 this character 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.080
 then you have to put code that this 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.989
 and the coffee 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.660
 I'm going to leave the code for both of them. 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.530
 registration because the person 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.380
 I want to leave it in the description is more 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.989
 it's easy to put 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.320
 O and then you see is looking 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.050
 mine at all times he then an angels 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.850
 skin 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.090
 the winner will leave all the videos 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.790
 so I just thought that people 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.750
 you own this wedding 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.980
 appeared the language I playing I film 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.330
 weight damage and the new microphone watch 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.580
 produce generic 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.960
 but you if you want to look for a 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:14.900
 colloquy is not heating 3 to 1 on 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:18.530
 portugal only if it is to make maneuvers 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.090
 insists on you skateboard 3 skateboard 2 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.990
 it is easier to do and deadly so much 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.380
 from you 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.390
 the rest 31 I have a mortal I go 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.450
 do is wear protective behave one 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.360
 internal skateboard organ 2 gw up to 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.500
 Santa ranch ended in 2002 were 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.280
 agents found portal then skate 3 a 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.560
 harder to do but it's a good match 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.850
 cool but I do not want to be just bringing 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.750
 to debret optimal channel 3 because 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.209
 video of your jet already mount the video of 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:02.420

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:07.940
 batman county and with a sewer is rang 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.640
 with a star wars that is cool is also 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.010
 enough game there has to do with which 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.620
 It's going to be the next day. 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.419
 even if I can get that 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.590
 Jimmy Bell said that I told the team 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.190

 I'll put that one there too because he 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.310
 it's too good 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.590
 the game got lukewarm and no band 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.830

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.169
 much better 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.520
