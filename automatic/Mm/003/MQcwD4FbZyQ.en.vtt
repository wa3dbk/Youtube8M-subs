00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.770 
can't possibly be anything wrong with
buying<00:02:06.240> 90<00:02:06.509> percent<00:02:06.840> silver<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.489> no

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
buying 90 percent silver can there no

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.290 
buying 90 percent silver can there no
but<00:02:10.099> what<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> true<00:02:11.940> silver

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
but what if there is a true silver

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.230 
but what if there is a true silver
shortage

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
shortage

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.030 
shortage
in<00:02:14.050> an<00:02:14.890> industry<00:02:15.370> needs<00:02:15.780> silver<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.890> they're

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
in an industry needs silver so they're

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.950 
in an industry needs silver so they're
calling<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.490> refineries<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.630> give<00:02:19.810> them

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
calling on the refineries to give them

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.990 
calling on the refineries to give them
as<00:02:20.080> much<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:20.410> they<00:02:20.440> can<00:02:20.740> give<00:02:20.890> them<00:02:21.040> what<00:02:21.910> if

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
as much as they can give them what if

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.910 
as much as they can give them what if
there's<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.270> huge<00:02:22.540> amount<00:02:22.810> like<00:02:23.440> what<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:23.740> saw

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
there's a huge amount like what we saw

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.240 
there's a huge amount like what we saw
in<00:02:23.950> during<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.910> Hunt<00:02:25.090> Brothers<00:02:25.150> saga<00:02:26.250> well

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
in during the Hunt Brothers saga well

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.550 
in during the Hunt Brothers saga well

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
since this is 90% pure the refineries

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.540 
since this is 90% pure the refineries
are<00:02:32.230> gonna<00:02:32.320> be<00:02:32.440> looking<00:02:32.710> for<00:02:32.740> nine<00:02:33.280> nine<00:02:33.520> nine

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
and generic rounds better right because

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.630 
and generic rounds better right because
you<00:03:22.270> get<00:03:22.420> those<00:03:22.600> for<00:03:22.840> spa<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.410> those<00:03:23.890> are<00:03:24.010> 999

guess how many counterfeit bars are

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.940 
guess how many counterfeit bars are
gonna<00:03:33.190> be<00:03:33.900> it's<00:03:34.900> really<00:03:35.410> tough<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.680> make<00:03:35.920> a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
gonna be it's really tough to make a

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.070 
gonna be it's really tough to make a
counter<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.460> Eagle<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:37.240> will<00:03:37.420> pass<00:03:37.600> muster

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
counter for Eagle that will pass muster

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.920 
counter for Eagle that will pass muster
plus<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.740> don't<00:03:38.920> want<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:40.000> know<00:03:40.030> poke<00:03:40.750> the
