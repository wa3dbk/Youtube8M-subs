00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
kind of clean up or create a funnel so

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
kind of clean up or create a funnel so
the<00:00:17.279> main<00:00:17.430> attack<00:00:17.789> evolves<00:00:18.539> around<00:00:18.660> the

the main attack evolves around the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.800 
the main attack evolves around the
witches<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.800> super<00:00:20.039> easy<00:00:20.750> you<00:00:21.750> just

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
witches and this is super easy you just

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.200 
witches and this is super easy you just
deploy<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.859> your<00:00:22.980> troops<00:00:23.279> from<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
deploy all of your troops from the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.140 
deploy all of your troops from the
corner<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> then<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.830> pray<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> god

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
that this attack will succeed so

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.560 
that this attack will succeed so
obviously<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.160> attack<00:00:32.579> requires<00:00:33.300> some

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
obviously this attack requires some

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.420 
obviously this attack requires some
certain<00:00:33.899> type<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> bases<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.070> type<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
certain type of bases so in this type of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.780 
certain type of bases so in this type of
base<00:00:35.790> has<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> huge<00:00:37.079> center<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.890> there's<00:00:38.579> not

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
base has a huge center and there's not

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
base has a huge center and there's not
many<00:00:38.940> compartment<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.500> witches

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
many compartment that I that the witches

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.350 
many compartment that I that the witches
has<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> go<00:00:41.309> through<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> type<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
has to go through so in this type of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
has to go through so in this type of
base<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.649> don't<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.190> many

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
base like if you don't have so many

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.029 
base like if you don't have so many
walls<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.510> through<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.350> pretty<00:00:46.800> nice

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
walls to to go through it's pretty nice

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.000 
walls to to go through it's pretty nice
and<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.789> also<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.600> bring<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.050> jump<00:00:49.469> spell<00:00:49.770> so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and you also can bring to jump spell so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.270 
and you also can bring to jump spell so
that<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.390> lead<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.110> troops<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that you can kind of lead the troops to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
that you can kind of lead the troops to
enter<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> core<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> can

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
enter to the core and then you can

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.869 
enter to the core and then you can
actually<00:00:55.320> help<00:00:55.530> them<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> core

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
actually help them go out from the core

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.569 
actually help them go out from the core
as<00:00:56.969> well<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.469> things<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.460> do

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
as well so there are some things to do

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
as well so there are some things to do
but<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.969> general<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> super<00:01:01.109> easy<00:01:01.260> attack

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
but in general this is super easy attack

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.830 
but in general this is super easy attack
anybody<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.120> without<00:01:03.510> really

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
anybody can do it without really

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.810 
anybody can do it without really
thinking<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.070> 3<00:01:05.339> stars<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
thinking and you can get 3 stars so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.940 
thinking and you can get 3 stars so
we're<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> watch<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.659> attack<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:09.950> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
create a funnel so that all the troops

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
create a funnel so that all the troops
kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.020> tends<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.619> towards<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.250> core<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
kind of tends to go towards the core and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.289 
kind of tends to go towards the core and
as<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.110> these<00:01:31.740> structures<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.579> cleaned<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.119> i

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
as the these structures are cleaned up i

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
as the these structures are cleaned up i
deploy<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> jump<00:01:34.380> spell<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.860> those

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
deploy the jump spell so that those

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.090 
deploy the jump spell so that those
dudes<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:36.090> jump<00:01:36.420> inside<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> core<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> then

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
dudes will jump inside the core and then

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
dudes will jump inside the core and then
it's<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.670> golem<00:01:39.090> jumps<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.540> king<00:01:39.900> jumps<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it's the golem jumps in king jumps in I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.880 
it's the golem jumps in king jumps in I
put<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> rage<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> core<00:01:42.270> part

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
put down a rage so that the core part

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.350 
put down a rage so that the core part
gets<00:01:43.890> destroyed<00:01:44.310> pretty<00:01:44.610> quickly<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.180> lot

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
gets destroyed pretty quickly so a lot

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.910 
gets destroyed pretty quickly so a lot
of<00:01:45.390> witches<00:01:45.720> are<00:01:45.960> jumping<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> core<00:01:46.799> as

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
of witches are jumping into the core as

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.840 
of witches are jumping into the core as
well<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.490> these<00:01:47.790> discs<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:49.640> structures<00:01:50.640> will

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
well so these discs or structures will

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.520 
well so these discs or structures will
be<00:01:50.970> taken<00:01:51.420> down<00:01:51.540> pretty<00:01:51.899> quickly<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.380> mean

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
be taken down pretty quickly I mean

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
be taken down pretty quickly I mean
witches<00:01:52.829> are<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.399> good<00:01:53.610> thinking<00:01:54.060> troops

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
witches are really good thinking troops

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
witches are really good thinking troops
as<00:01:54.930> well<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.409> not<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.979> we're<00:01:56.399> wizard<00:01:56.700> too

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
as well and not like we're wizard too

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.999 
as well and not like we're wizard too
because<00:01:57.360> wizard<00:01:57.719> they<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:58.770> easily

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
because wizard they can get easily

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.880 
because wizard they can get easily
targeted<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> they're<00:02:00.570> pretty<00:02:00.810> weak<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
targeted and they're pretty weak but the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.130 
targeted and they're pretty weak but the
witches<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> skeleton<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.420> support

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
witches they have a skeleton to support

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.679 
witches they have a skeleton to support
them<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:05.040> survive<00:02:05.549> really<00:02:06.479> long

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
them and then they survive really long

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.080 
them and then they survive really long
so<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.229> goal<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.920> attack<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.610> give<00:02:08.910> up

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
so the goal of this attack is to give up

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.780 
so the goal of this attack is to give up
it's<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> high<00:02:10.679> DPS<00:02:11.190> ways<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.610> give

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it's not really a high DPS ways to give

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's not really a high DPS ways to give
a<00:02:11.819> stream<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.780> damage

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
a stream of damage

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.310 
a stream of damage
h<00:02:13.530> very<00:02:14.370> constantly<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.990> then<00:02:16.140> it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
h very constantly so that and then it

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.580 
h very constantly so that and then it
wears<00:02:16.950> down<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.450> enemy<00:02:18.780> bases<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.410> it's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
wears down the the enemy bases and it's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.560 
wears down the the enemy bases and it's
it's<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.220> stable<00:02:20.850> i<00:02:20.970> mean<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.300> first
