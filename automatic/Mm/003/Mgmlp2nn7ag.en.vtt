local piece it was very much a Cumbrian

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.540 
local piece it was very much a Cumbrian
thing<00:05:42.780> yeah<00:05:43.020> these<00:05:43.410> little<00:05:43.680> Gardens<00:05:44.250> out<00:05:44.340> here

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
you look at them and it's like comparing

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.350 
you look at them and it's like comparing
an<00:05:46.020> ax<00:05:46.170> minster<00:05:46.650> carpet<00:05:47.190> out<00:05:47.460> there<00:05:47.820> with<00:05:48.330> a

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
an ax minster carpet out there with a

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.810 
an ax minster carpet out there with a
tiny<00:05:48.720> little<00:05:49.020> needlepoint<00:05:49.650> tapestry<00:05:50.430> these

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
tiny little needlepoint tapestry these

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.060 
tiny little needlepoint tapestry these
are<00:05:51.000> so<00:05:51.180> finely<00:05:51.570> stitched<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.590> must<00:05:52.890> make

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
are so finely stitched it must make

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.620 
are so finely stitched it must make
working<00:05:53.460> them<00:05:53.820> very<00:05:54.000> difficult<00:05:54.180> you<00:05:54.480> must

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
working them very difficult you must

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.200 
working them very difficult you must
fall<00:05:54.810> over<00:05:55.140> yourselves<00:05:55.530> as<00:05:55.850> few<00:05:56.850> people<00:05:56.880> in

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
fall over yourselves as few people in

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.400 
fall over yourselves as few people in
the<00:05:57.270> garden<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.750> it's<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:58.200> you<00:05:58.260> have<00:05:58.350> to

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
the garden and it's that you have to

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.960 
the garden and it's that you have to
really<00:05:58.920> be<00:05:59.160> careful<00:05:59.340> what<00:05:59.550> you're<00:05:59.640> doing

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
really be careful what you're doing

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.520 
really be careful what you're doing
everything<00:06:00.570> has<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.840> perform<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.380> know

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
everything has to perform you know

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.260 
everything has to perform you know
everything<00:06:02.190> has<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.400> be<00:06:02.940> in<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.090> best

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
everything has to be in the best

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.150 
everything has to be in the best
possible<00:06:03.600> condition<00:06:04.350> so<00:06:05.340> it's<00:06:05.550> a<00:06:05.640> meticulous

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
possible condition so it's a meticulous

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.950 
possible condition so it's a meticulous
exercise<00:06:08.160> he<00:06:08.760> would<00:06:09.090> say<00:06:09.330> oh<00:06:09.360> you<00:06:09.720> know<00:06:09.840> it's

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
exercise he would say oh you know it's

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.030 
exercise he would say oh you know it's
only<00:06:10.080> a<00:06:10.170> tiny<00:06:10.410> one<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.680> would<00:06:10.800> be<00:06:10.830> much<00:06:11.010> easier

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
only a tiny one it would be much easier

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.680 
only a tiny one it would be much easier
to<00:06:11.520> do<00:06:11.640> a<00:06:11.670> small<00:06:11.970> one<00:06:12.120> like<00:06:12.150> this<00:06:12.420> and<00:06:12.480> a<00:06:12.660> big

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
to do a small one like this and a big

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.130 
to do a small one like this and a big
one

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
one

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.830 
one
presumably<00:06:13.470> it<00:06:13.680> presents<00:06:14.100> its<00:06:14.220> own<00:06:14.340> problems

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
presumably it presents its own problems

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.120 
presumably it presents its own problems
it<00:06:15.840> certainly<00:06:16.260> does<00:06:16.500> because<00:06:16.890> you<00:06:17.010> know

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
it certainly does because you know

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.740 
it certainly does because you know
actually<00:06:17.640> what<00:06:17.760> happens<00:06:18.090> is<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.630> don't

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
actually what happens is you don't

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.330 
actually what happens is you don't
realize<00:06:18.960> how<00:06:19.260> small<00:06:19.560> it<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:19.860> so<00:06:20.070> everything

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
realize how small it is so everything

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.250 
realize how small it is so everything
does<00:06:20.520> have<00:06:20.700> to<00:06:20.820> be<00:06:20.850> in<00:06:21.030> scale<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:21.690> some<00:06:22.080> of<00:06:22.200> the

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
does have to be in scale and some of the

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.140 
does have to be in scale and some of the
elements<00:06:22.530> we<00:06:23.040> originally<00:06:23.430> had<00:06:23.550> thought<00:06:23.760> of

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
elements we originally had thought of

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.180 
elements we originally had thought of
for<00:06:24.300> the<00:06:24.330> garden<00:06:24.720> actually<00:06:25.470> ended<00:06:25.950> up<00:06:26.010> being

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
for the garden actually ended up being

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.760 
for the garden actually ended up being
far<00:06:26.430> too<00:06:26.490> large<00:06:27.180> and<00:06:27.660> so<00:06:28.110> we<00:06:28.200> had<00:06:28.320> to<00:06:28.410> sit<00:06:28.530> down

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
far too large and so we had to sit down

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.070 
far too large and so we had to sit down
scale<00:06:29.130> it<00:06:29.250> even<00:06:29.520> when<00:06:29.670> we<00:06:29.760> were<00:06:29.820> on<00:06:29.960> you<00:06:30.960> know

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
scale it even when we were on you know

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.080 
scale it even when we were on you know
on<00:06:31.200> the<00:06:31.320> grounds<00:06:31.770> luckily<00:06:32.370> we<00:06:32.490> were<00:06:32.580> supported

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
on the grounds luckily we were supported

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.460 
on the grounds luckily we were supported
by<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.270> artists<00:06:33.780> a<00:06:33.840> lot<00:06:33.960> who<00:06:34.080> really<00:06:34.320> made
