can see it has coil packs

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.089 
can see it has coil packs
that's<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> coil<00:00:31.140> pack<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that's the coil pack right there and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.100 
that's the coil pack right there and
there's<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.969> top<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> every<00:00:33.750> cylinder

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
there's one on top of every cylinder

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.569 
there's one on top of every cylinder
three<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.890> each<00:00:35.010> side

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
three on each side

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.150 
three on each side
first<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> want<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.960> yes<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.800> have

plenum upper intake off to do that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990 
plenum upper intake off to do that
basically<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:47.190> we're<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> right<00:00:47.730> side

basically first we're on the right side
of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> engine<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.800> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
of the engine here as you can see this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.880 
of the engine here as you can see this
is<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.520> number<00:00:51.120> six<00:00:51.420> coil<00:00:51.930> pack<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> spark

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
is my number six coil pack and the spark

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
is my number six coil pack and the spark
plugs<00:00:53.160> below<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.480> want<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> take<00:00:54.960> off

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
plugs below it so you want to take off

pops<00:00:56.969> off<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> follow<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> back<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.770> goes

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
pops off if you follow it back it goes

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
pops off if you follow it back it goes

on one of these Cadillacs everybody's
going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.770> tell<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.790> videos<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.360> see

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
going to tell you in the videos you see

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
going to tell you in the videos you see
they're<00:01:45.990> never<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.619> show<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
they're never going to really show you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.060 
they're never going to really show you
so<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.320> them<00:01:49.560> taking<00:01:49.950> those

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
so what you see is them taking those

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.179 
so what you see is them taking those
five<00:01:50.430> bolts<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.689> four<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.170> top<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.799> one

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
five bolts out the four on top here one

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.850 
five bolts out the four on top here one
here<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.700> one<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> back<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.470> hits<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
here and one in the back and it hits the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.069 
here and one in the back and it hits the
firewall<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.270> pry<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.869> back

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
firewall you have to like pry that back

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.620 
firewall you have to like pry that back
piece<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> bolt<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.299> so<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> fought

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
piece up to get the bolt out so I fought

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.330 
piece up to get the bolt out so I fought
with<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.590> try<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.979> say<00:02:02.159> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
with this thing to try they say just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.459 
with this thing to try they say just
slide<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> forward<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.329> prop<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:03.990> over<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
slide it forward and prop it over this

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.840 
slide it forward and prop it over this
little<00:02:04.770> bracket<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.430> here

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
little bracket right here

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.119 
little bracket right here
well<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.810> ain't<00:02:07.140> moving<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.649> fought<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:07.920> this

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
well it ain't moving I fought with this

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.010 
well it ain't moving I fought with this
thing<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:08.580> about<00:02:08.610> thirty<00:02:09.030> minutes<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.929> then

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
thing for about thirty minutes and then

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.450 
thing for about thirty minutes and then
I<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.319> there

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
I look down there

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.990 
I look down there
all<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.990> 19<00:02:12.990> millimeter<00:02:13.230> bolt<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.550> held<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
all a 19 millimeter bolt that held the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.460 
all a 19 millimeter bolt that held the
bracket<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:15.930> loosened<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.380> up

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
bracket on so I just loosened it up

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.150 
bracket on so I just loosened it up
enough<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.850> bracket<00:02:18.240> fell<00:02:18.570> out<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> way

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
enough so that bracket fell out the way

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.050 
enough so that bracket fell out the way
all<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.400> Fighting's<00:02:20.730> over

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
all the Fighting's over

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.250 
all the Fighting's over
now<00:02:21.590> intakes<00:02:22.590> free<00:02:23.570> as<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.870> see<00:02:25.050> there

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
now intakes free as you can see there

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.190 
now intakes free as you can see there
you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.470> move<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.830> around<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.840> next<00:02:27.840> step

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
you can move it around and next step

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.930 
you can move it around and next step
would<00:02:28.410> be<00:02:29.840> how<00:02:30.840> okay<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.220> had<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> take<00:02:32.790> this

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
would be how okay so I had to take this

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.590 
would be how okay so I had to take this
bolt<00:02:33.210> off<00:02:33.420> here<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:35.370> holds<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.850> wire

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
bolt off here and that holds that wire

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600 
bolt off here and that holds that wire
harness<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:37.920> get<00:02:38.250> to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
harness that's just so I can get to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.900 
harness that's just so I can get to
those<00:02:38.730> coils<00:02:39.300> there<00:02:39.770> I<00:02:40.770> had<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.280> take<00:02:41.490> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
those coils there I had to take of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.070 
those coils there I had to take of
course<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:43.040> little<00:02:44.040> bolt<00:02:44.250> out<00:02:44.460> of<00:02:44.580> here<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.080> had

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
course a little bolt out of here I had

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.220 
course a little bolt out of here I had
to<00:02:46.170> take<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.380> loosen<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.370> bolt<00:02:47.640> holding<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
to take a loosen that bolt holding that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.410 
to take a loosen that bolt holding that
then<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.350> took<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.830> air<00:02:50.430> intake<00:02:50.850> tube<00:02:51.090> coming

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
then we took the air intake tube coming

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.860 
then we took the air intake tube coming
off<00:02:51.920> took<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.100> off<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.430> there<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.870> that's

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
off took that off of there and that's

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.700 
off took that off of there and that's
pretty<00:02:55.050> much<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
pretty much it

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.830 
pretty much it
we<00:02:56.250> took<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.610> little<00:02:56.850> hose<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.450> went<00:02:57.690> from

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
we took the little hose that went from

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.650 
we took the little hose that went from
back<00:02:58.110> there<00:02:58.350> over<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> D<00:02:59.940> intake<00:03:00.150> tube<00:03:00.480> we

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
back there over to the D intake tube we

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.370 
back there over to the D intake tube we
took<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.020> off<00:03:01.200> all<00:03:02.040> right<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.340> next<00:03:02.490> step

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
took that off all right so next step

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
took that off all right so next step
disconnect<00:03:04.380> your<00:03:04.500> connector<00:03:05.600> on<00:03:06.600> your

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
disconnect your connector on your

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.170 
disconnect your connector on your
conditioned<00:03:08.400> coil<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.970> one

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
conditioned coil to do that on this one

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.450 
conditioned coil to do that on this one
here<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.600> push<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.140> there's<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.830> flat<00:03:14.190> side

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
here you push in there's a flat side

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.060 
here you push in there's a flat side
with<00:03:14.730> grooves<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.990> so<00:03:16.770> another

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
with grooves on it on that so another

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.800 
with grooves on it on that so another
side<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.490> doesn't<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.330> push<00:03:18.600> in

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
side it doesn't have that so you push in

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.360 
side it doesn't have that so you push in
on<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:18.960> and<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:20.040> pops<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:21.150> side<00:03:21.420> out<00:03:21.630> some

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
on that and it pops this side out some

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
on that and it pops this side out some
so<00:03:23.370> basically<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.880> wrestle<00:03:24.240> with<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.600> until

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
so basically you wrestle with that until

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.400 
so basically you wrestle with that until
it<00:03:25.530> comes<00:03:25.710> all<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.010> way<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.240> whichever

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
it comes all the way out whichever

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.870 
it comes all the way out whichever
they're<00:03:28.410> usually<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.770> pain<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.550> was<00:03:29.700> going<00:03:29.820> to

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
they're usually a pain that was going to

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.530 
they're usually a pain that was going to
be<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.030> painter

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
be a painter

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.570 
be a painter
so<00:03:30.990> you<00:03:31.050> do<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.650> three<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.160> them<00:03:32.310> you

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
so you do that all three of them you

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.670 
so you do that all three of them you
loosen<00:03:33.120> all<00:03:33.360> three<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.750> these<00:03:33.840> 10<00:03:34.140> millimeter

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
loosen all three of these 10 millimeter

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.760 
loosen all three of these 10 millimeter
bolts<00:03:35.720> all<00:03:36.720> right<00:03:36.840> we<00:03:36.960> got<00:03:37.110> everything<00:03:37.380> loose

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
bolts all right we got everything loose

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.440 
bolts all right we got everything loose
we<00:03:38.010> got<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> connectors<00:03:38.700> taken<00:03:39.060> off<00:03:39.210> we've

all went away so I figured I'd change
