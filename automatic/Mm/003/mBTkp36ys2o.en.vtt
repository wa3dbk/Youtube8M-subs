00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.040
 commanding my father 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.099
 retired military middle-aged people already 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.210
 he appreciates simple but reliable things 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.549
 his age is no longer the same 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.260
 understand imported technology and yes 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.810
 Soviet education is just not so 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.849
 passes so when I searched for it 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.900
 a gift to the 70th anniversary 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.369
 in front of me, I had a difficult task 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 I wanted to give him a watch 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.560
 at the same time they had to be reliable 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
 easy to use and importantly 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 Russian production 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.750
 distrust of all western 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.730
 father's head never got out 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 to face 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.020
 I remembered that my grandfather was a front - line soldier 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 long ago to the day of victory in the Soviet still 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.309
 times gave the clock east 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 I searched the information I have was that during 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.690
 this one survived all safely 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.879
 troubled times and crises and still 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 works cheerfully and the assortment is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.920
 the youngest interested me 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 specific model 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.600
 commander hours in the first me 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.120
 attracted a great name 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.280
 retired colonel father so 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.190
 commander to call it and it is quite possible 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.370
 he will surely be pleased to go 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.680
 on the clock must certainly be 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.810
 mechanical father doesn't like complicated 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 electronics 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.070
 commanding us by this indicator 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.380
 he has a classic mechanism 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.780
 sample word 2414 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.880
 its technology has not changed for several 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.220
 decades so in the case 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.260
 any breakdown will be easy 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.770
 find a qualified master for 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.770
 mending 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.189
 I thought 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.310
 for the price I will be offered in 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.770
 best case is durable plastic in these 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.350
 hours is quite a solid metal case 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.500
 surely father has no plans to score 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.619
 this watch nails but if suddenly at us 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.829
 accidentally dropped think not stand it 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.189
 load shockproof mechanism which 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.869
 equipped with a watch adds reliability 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.849
 steel is harder to scratch but 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.099
 engraved on the back of the case i 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.110
 I will definitely do it on light metal 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.620
 she will look good 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.170
 Another important point considered large 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.810
 clock face 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.819
 Fatherâ€™s vision to put it mildly is not the most 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.970
 acute therefore it is necessary that it be possible 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.890
 watch the time even without glasses and here 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.450
 you can safely tick this 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.920
 Big numbers too 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.500
 considered excellent even at dusk 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.569
 because there are dots next to them 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.629
 covered with special fluorescent 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.640
 in a layer I remember how solemnly each 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.849
 the evening turned on his watch my grandfather 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.099
 it was a kind of ritual grandfather spoke 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.019
 that when he forgets to wind the watch is 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.200
 should be a sign to us that 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.389
 he is already a deep old man interesting version 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.310
 but you have to understand the manual winding 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.620
 really does discipline 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.840
 man I also heard that father 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.200
 spoke dismissively about the car factory 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.359
 said that it is for headless look 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.359
 commanding 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:13.349
 you need to start them manually head for 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.910
 the plant is comfortable and also quite large 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.480
 excellent father will be busy and 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.480
 disciplined go further on 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.090
 the belt he's pretty laconic made of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.209
 skin father does not pay much attention 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.160
 design but for me it's pretty 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.450
 an important point I want to watch 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.799
 looked decent from this point of view 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.239
 the classic solution of genuine leather 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.750
 I am very happy 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.609
 In addition, manufacturers state that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.530
 the compounds that are treated belt 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.590
 no toxic allergenic 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.539
 dyes take a word because 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.609
 allergic to contact with not 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.319
 quality materials are not the most 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.180
 nice 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.409
 you can give your father on an important 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.030
 holiday so summarize 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.370
 commander clock east it is quite 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.280
 reliable and high quality classic 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.920
 model for a person who appreciates 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.689
 convenience and not inclined to understand 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.239
 complex technical systems 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.790
 but at the same time true to tradition for 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.139
 hand would not be very convenient for me 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.840
 mechanical plant 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.380
 but this watch is meant for my father 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.180
 but for him the classic is important is great 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.479
 dial with illuminated hands 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.310
 adds ease of use 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.150
 warranty from the manufacturer too 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.150
 nice bonus
