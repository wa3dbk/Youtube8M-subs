00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
have to carve into it but I find it does

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.000 
have to carve into it but I find it does
help<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.300> lot<00:01:46.510> another<00:01:46.900> thing<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.350> people<00:01:47.560> might

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
help a lot another thing is people might

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.640 
help a lot another thing is people might
just<00:01:48.700> be<00:01:48.880> doing<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.240> ninety<00:01:49.600> which<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.380> really

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
just be doing the ninety which is really

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.010 
just be doing the ninety which is really
really<00:01:50.740> good<00:01:51.390> except<00:01:52.390> you've<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.810> got<00:01:52.930> to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
really good except you've just got to

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.170 
really good except you've just got to
put<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.740> little<00:01:53.950> bit<00:01:54.250> more<00:01:54.400> boost<00:01:54.700> and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
put in that little bit more boost and

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.230 
put in that little bit more boost and
that<00:01:56.050> little<00:01:56.290> bit<00:01:56.410> will<00:01:56.560> wind<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.790> then<00:02:00.240> right

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
that little bit will wind and then right

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.950 
that little bit will wind and then right
when<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.229> do<00:02:02.350> this<00:02:02.500> trick<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:03.040> want<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.640> get

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
when you do this trick you want to get

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.290 
when you do this trick you want to get
quite<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> bit<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.290> speed<00:02:05.560> as<00:02:05.860> most<00:02:06.760> people<00:02:07.090> do

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
quite a bit of speed as most people do

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.990 
quite a bit of speed as most people do
when<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.570> do<00:02:07.690> sliding<00:02:08.170> because<00:02:08.320> sliding<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
when you do sliding because sliding it

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.720 
when you do sliding because sliding it
does<00:02:10.270> require<00:02:10.510> speed<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.530> when<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.430> do<00:02:12.580> this

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
does require speed so when you do this

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.660 
does require speed so when you do this
you<00:02:13.150> want<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> get<00:02:13.540> at<00:02:14.140> least<00:02:14.410> about<00:02:14.830> four<00:02:15.580> or

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
you want to get at least about four or

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.800 
you want to get at least about four or
five<00:02:15.850> good<00:02:16.150> push<00:02:16.360> off<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.810> one

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.620 

if<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.960> fell<00:02:25.170> keep<00:02:25.350> sliding<00:02:25.650> off<00:02:26.630> it's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
if you fell keep sliding off it's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.270 
if you fell keep sliding off it's
probably<00:02:28.140> not<00:02:28.290> because<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> your<00:02:28.890> grip<00:02:29.070> tape

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
probably not because of your grip tape

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.360 
probably not because of your grip tape
it's<00:02:29.610> probably<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.070> need<00:02:32.250> to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
it's probably because you just need to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's probably because you just need to
place<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:32.910> force<00:02:33.360> all<00:02:34.230> onto<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.710> board<00:02:34.920> like

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
place your force all onto the board like

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.940 
place your force all onto the board like

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
lap around a little bit then it'll just

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.870 
lap around a little bit then it'll just
give<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.350> up<00:02:40.470> extra<00:02:40.860> boost<00:02:41.070> clean<00:02:41.760> that's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
give it up extra boost clean that's

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
give it up extra boost clean that's
about<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.240> okay<00:02:42.930> guys<00:02:43.080> that's<00:02:43.410> basically<00:02:43.920> the
