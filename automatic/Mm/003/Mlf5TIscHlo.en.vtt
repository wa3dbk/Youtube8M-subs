 states and this is a mixture, you know that 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.210

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.500
 of weird thing like this here so it is and I 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.330
 agreement 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.280
 there was nobody you remember you are 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.890
 with the super weird we all did 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.910
 to get a super shabby sofa and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.710
 disgusting 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.730
 we took like that so come on we have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.280
 go we have our sofa pieces and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.289
 you said alehop 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 this garbage is over and there is no need to 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.480
 do more this we have this here here is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.760
 incredibly magnificent according to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.460
 this simple character we can make a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.640
 chair according as you see with all the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.829
 materials leaves the chair 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.329
 oh how beautiful and you can get into it 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.769
 also 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.400
 and if so, how great 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.170
 we can also make tables 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.330
 the very nice tables of wants of 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.940
 manner of the same subject with this character or 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.600
 so simple it is obvious besides that cool the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.430
 table that summarizes is in her magnificent 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.200
 we can make sofas and also we type 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.530
 to heal different but many types 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.920
 of sofas up to five different models 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.050
 red white beige one or two we can 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.280
 go up too but the good thing about the couch is 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.200
 that is the country putting together the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.200
 you can do enormously big 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.110
 previous 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.390
 for 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.810
 and I believe the really great logo starts 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.700
 here allianz and ready good 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.490
 have more things we can do here 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.780
 then make carpets that in some 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.180
 points and we can do them but 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.950
 we are currently at 1 point 6.2 so 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.210
 that we can make beautiful carpets and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.130
 magnificent as you see 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.690
 that by the way I'm touching and this 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.070
 comes from the 1.6 so they want the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.960
 carpets do not go well says in 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.350
 develop new is something that already 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.630
 we had for a long time so it's not 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.490
 nothing of another world we can do the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.360
 These tubes of 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.740
 of bush which we can put well 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.930
 and it really is not a whole cube 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.660
 it really is a rectangle that to the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.300
 true that very nice he hears that he has 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.100
 liked is this nonsense it will seem that 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.620
 no but but she is alone because you can 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 do some very very clothes things 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.420
 obviously you can do it with all 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.010
 the bush types we can make a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.340
 bell is worth the bell that is on top 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.840

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.960

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.710

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.420
 make a furnace a bar that unified oven 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.230
 in which we can heat things like 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.540

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.580

 character has no oxygen is pure metal 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.780

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.600
