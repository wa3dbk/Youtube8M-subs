00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the guitar part starts so it starts like

00:00:11.219 --> 00:03:07.920

bit about how this song works it's
played<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.360> open<00:03:32.810> C<00:03:33.079> tuning<00:03:33.349> so<00:03:34.159> you<00:03:34.220> have

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
played in the open C tuning so you have

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:43.240 
played in the open C tuning so you have
the<00:03:34.670> notes<00:03:34.909> C<00:03:36.610> G<00:03:38.049> C<00:03:39.640> G<00:03:40.720> C<00:03:41.720> C<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:42.859> that's<00:03:42.950> what<00:03:43.159> the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
the notes C G C G C C so that's what the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.880 
the notes C G C G C C so that's what the
guitar<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.700> tuned<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.299> open<00:03:44.599> C<00:03:44.840> tuning<00:03:45.049> so

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
guitar is tuned to is open C tuning so

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.789 
guitar is tuned to is open C tuning so
it's<00:03:46.069> got<00:03:46.220> C<00:03:46.549> notes<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.090> G<00:03:47.599> notes<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.109> so

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
it's got C notes and G notes and so

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.809 
it's got C notes and G notes and so
basically<00:03:49.069> what<00:03:49.220> we're<00:03:49.310> going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.489> do<00:03:49.670> is

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
basically what we're going to do is

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.599 
basically what we're going to do is
we're<00:03:49.939> going<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> take<00:03:50.290> intervals<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.609> C

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
we're going to take intervals in the C

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.190 
we're going to take intervals in the C
major<00:03:52.640> scale<00:03:53.030> starting<00:03:53.690> with<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:55.220> first

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
major scale starting with this first

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.849 
major scale starting with this first
interval<00:03:57.200> here<00:03:57.590> it's<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.489> third<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.709> it's

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
interval here it's a third so it's

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.680 
interval here it's a third so it's
meaning<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.400> third<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.000> if<00:04:02.060> you're<00:04:02.239> playing<00:04:02.510> in

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
meaning a third so if you're playing in

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.849 
meaning a third so if you're playing in
the<00:04:02.780> key<00:04:03.019> of<00:04:03.049> C<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:04.609> notes<00:04:04.849> are<00:04:05.000> c<00:04:05.359> d<00:04:05.690> e<00:04:05.720> f<00:04:05.989> g<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.680> b

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
the key of C the notes are c d e f g a b

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.940 
the key of C the notes are c d e f g a b
c<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.549> scale<00:04:08.060> so<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:09.260> third<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.799> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
c and that scale so the third is the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.289 
c and that scale so the third is the
first<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.549> third<00:04:10.579> note<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.180> scale

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
first and the third note in the scale

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.920 
first and the third note in the scale
which<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.750> C<00:04:12.200> D<00:04:12.680> E<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.489> C<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.819> E<00:04:14.269> are<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.689> first

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
which is C D E so C and E are the first

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.620 
which is C D E so C and E are the first
and<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.200> third<00:04:15.230> chord<00:04:15.739> in<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.010> scale<00:04:16.310> so

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
and the third chord in the scale so

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.540 
and the third chord in the scale so
we're<00:04:17.630> playing<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.989> third<00:04:18.260> interval<00:04:20.919> here<00:04:21.919> and

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
we're playing a third interval here and

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.370 
we're playing a third interval here and
we're<00:04:22.849> playing<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.180> third<00:04:23.419> again<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:27.229> we're

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
we're playing a third again so we're

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.900 
we're playing a third again so we're
taking<00:04:27.470> thirds<00:04:27.949> taking<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.520> C<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:28.880> the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
taking thirds taking the C and the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.909 
taking thirds taking the C and the
eighth<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.360> D<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.080> F<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.650> then<00:04:30.889> the

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
eighth and the D and the F and then the

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.659 
eighth and the D and the F and then the
E<00:04:31.039> and<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.550> G<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:32.120> taking<00:04:32.389> each<00:04:33.010> third<00:04:34.010> up<00:04:34.310> on

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
E and the G and taking each third up on

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.659 
E and the G and taking each third up on
this<00:04:35.539> pattern<00:04:36.080> so<00:04:36.949> that's<00:04:37.280> why<00:04:37.430> we're<00:04:37.580> going

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
this pattern so that's why we're going

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.310 
this pattern so that's why we're going
to<00:04:37.729> call<00:04:37.909> this<00:04:38.090> we're<00:04:38.479> just<00:04:38.599> going<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.750> instead

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
to call this we're just going to instead

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.540 
to call this we're just going to instead
of<00:04:39.380> calling<00:04:39.650> on<00:04:39.770> in<00:04:39.860> chords<00:04:40.280> we're<00:04:40.370> going<00:04:40.490> to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
of calling on in chords we're going to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.710 
of calling on in chords we're going to
just<00:04:40.639> play<00:04:40.820> intervals<00:04:41.240> because<00:04:41.389> we're

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
just play intervals because we're

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.050 
just play intervals because we're
playing<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.620> C<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.039> G<00:04:43.130> notes<00:04:43.520> all<00:04:43.849> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
playing the C and the G notes all the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.370 
playing the C and the G notes all the
way<00:04:44.120> throughout<00:04:44.419> with<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.840> other<00:04:44.990> open

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
way throughout with the other open

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.290 
way throughout with the other open
strings

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.360 

and<00:04:48.390> then<00:04:48.900> we're<00:04:49.020> just<00:04:49.140> adding<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.890> intervals

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
and then we're just adding the intervals

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.750 
and then we're just adding the intervals
in<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.760> major<00:04:51.420> scale<00:04:51.750> on<00:04:52.020> these<00:04:52.530> chords<00:04:53.540> so<00:04:54.540> I

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
in the major scale on these chords so I

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.000 
in the major scale on these chords so I
start<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:56.970> write<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.450> song<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:58.050> notes<00:04:58.470> as<00:04:58.800> in

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
start I write the song in notes as in

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:09.050 
start I write the song in notes as in
this<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.460> one<00:04:59.760> two<00:05:00.750> three<00:05:02.780> four<00:05:03.980> five<00:05:05.780> six<00:05:08.060> six

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
this is one two three four five six six

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.280 
this is one two three four five six six
seven<00:05:10.070> eight<00:05:11.450> we<00:05:12.450> don't<00:05:12.600> play<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.870> seven<00:05:13.170> or

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
seven eight we don't play the seven or

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.670 
seven eight we don't play the seven or
the<00:05:13.320> 8<00:05:13.410> we<00:05:13.740> just<00:05:13.920> played<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.160> six<00:05:14.490> here<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.680> five

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
the 8 we just played a six here and five

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.590 
the 8 we just played a six here and five
and<00:05:17.460> four<00:05:17.900> three<00:05:18.900> two<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.070> one<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.480> can

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
and four three two and one so you can

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.230 
and four three two and one so you can
practice<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:22.140> those<00:05:23.070> intervals<00:05:23.460> together

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
practice that those intervals together

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.560 
practice that those intervals together
in<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.570> open<00:05:24.900> tuning<00:05:25.260> now<00:05:25.860> there's<00:05:26.160> only<00:05:26.250> one

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
in this open tuning now there's only one

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.620 
in this open tuning now there's only one
variation<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.960> that<00:05:28.140> and<00:05:28.410> it's<00:05:28.530> on<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:29.100> five

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
variation to that and it's on the five

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.470 
variation to that and it's on the five
sometimes<00:05:30.630> they<00:05:30.780> play<00:05:30.960> this<00:05:31.700> third<00:05:32.700> and

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
sometimes they play this third and

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.280 
sometimes they play this third and
sometimes<00:05:34.260> they<00:05:34.620> play<00:05:34.770> the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
sometimes they play the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.770 

kind<00:05:37.770> of<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.010> blues<00:05:38.250> feel<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.880> that<00:05:38.970> third<00:05:39.360> so

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
kind of the blues feel to that third so

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.900 
kind of the blues feel to that third so
and<00:05:40.410> that<00:05:40.770> just<00:05:40.950> happens<00:05:41.250> in<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.430> verse<00:05:41.610> when

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
and that just happens in the verse when

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:57.550 
and that just happens in the verse when
you<00:05:42.000> play<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:51.830> play<00:05:52.830> this<00:05:54.260> the<00:05:55.260> fifth<00:05:56.120> third

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
you play the play this the fifth third

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.690 
you play the play this the fifth third
the<00:05:58.560> five<00:05:58.860> chord<00:05:59.220> that's<00:05:59.370> we're<00:05:59.520> going<00:05:59.640> to

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
the five chord that's we're going to

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.730 
the five chord that's we're going to
call<00:05:59.850> it<00:05:59.940> a<00:06:00.000> five<00:06:00.270> it's<00:06:00.690> a<00:06:00.840> fifth<00:06:01.290> third

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
call it a five it's a fifth third

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.150 
call it a five it's a fifth third
interval<00:06:02.250> in<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:03.360> major<00:06:03.570> scale<00:06:04.010> so<00:06:05.010> they're

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
interval in the major scale so they're

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.560 
interval in the major scale so they're
actually<00:06:05.460> playing<00:06:05.670> a<00:06:05.820> variation<00:06:06.330> of<00:06:06.420> that

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
actually playing a variation of that

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.450 
actually playing a variation of that
instead<00:06:06.810> of<00:06:06.900> playing<00:06:07.140> this<00:06:07.350> note<00:06:07.620> these<00:06:08.280> two

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
instead of playing this note these two

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.070 
instead of playing this note these two
notes<00:06:08.700> they're<00:06:09.240> gonna<00:06:09.330> drop<00:06:09.450> it<00:06:09.600> a<00:06:09.660> half<00:06:09.810> step

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
notes they're gonna drop it a half step

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.210 
notes they're gonna drop it a half step
down<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:10.500> play<00:06:10.710> this<00:06:11.510> instead<00:06:12.950> so<00:06:13.950> that's<00:06:14.100> in

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
down and play this instead so that's in

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.460 
down and play this instead so that's in
the<00:06:14.310> verse<00:06:14.520> so<00:06:15.420> that's<00:06:15.570> the<00:06:15.660> only<00:06:15.810> variation

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
the verse so that's the only variation

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.620 
the verse so that's the only variation
in<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:16.770> chorus<00:06:17.160> you<00:06:17.370> play<00:06:17.940> a<00:06:17.970> five<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.570> you

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
in the chorus you play a five and you

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.460 
in the chorus you play a five and you
play<00:06:18.810> this<00:06:20.030> third<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:21.360> not<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:21.900> variation

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
play this third and not the variation

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.850 
play this third and not the variation
it's<00:06:22.740> not<00:06:22.830> exactly<00:06:23.280> the<00:06:24.080> third<00:06:25.080> interval<00:06:25.470> in

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
it's not exactly the third interval in

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.550 
it's not exactly the third interval in
the<00:06:26.160> major<00:06:26.370> scale<00:06:26.580> of<00:06:26.910> C<00:06:27.210> but<00:06:27.810> it's<00:06:27.960> close

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.100 

okay<00:06:32.560> so<00:06:33.160> that's<00:06:33.610> the<00:06:33.790> pattern<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:34.450> if<00:06:34.840> you

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
okay so that's the pattern and if you

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:43.560 
okay so that's the pattern and if you
want<00:06:35.560> to<00:06:35.650> practice<00:06:36.010> this<00:06:36.510> thirds<00:06:42.390> it'd<00:06:43.390> be<00:06:43.540> a

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
want to practice this thirds it'd be a

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.130 
want to practice this thirds it'd be a
good<00:06:43.690> thing<00:06:43.750> to<00:06:43.870> do<00:06:44.080> practice<00:06:44.470> that<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:46.140> play

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
good thing to do practice that and play

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.030 
good thing to do practice that and play
with<00:06:47.320> your<00:06:47.410> first<00:06:47.680> and<00:06:47.980> your<00:06:49.950> second<00:06:50.950> and

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
with your first and your second and

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.910 
with your first and your second and
third<00:06:51.070> finger<00:06:51.580> on<00:06:51.760> the<00:06:52.620> when<00:06:53.620> you<00:06:53.740> whenever

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
third finger on the when you whenever

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.830 
third finger on the when you whenever
you<00:06:54.160> have<00:06:54.310> one<00:06:54.580> fret<00:06:54.910> change<00:06:55.270> and<00:06:55.510> then<00:06:55.600> first

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
you have one fret change and then first

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.810 
you have one fret change and then first
and<00:06:56.050> third<00:06:56.170> finger<00:06:56.470> when<00:06:56.620> you<00:06:56.650> have<00:06:56.890> a<00:06:57.130> fret<00:06:57.700> in

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
and third finger when you have a fret in

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.330 
and third finger when you have a fret in
between<00:06:58.150> your<00:06:58.930> patterns<00:06:59.350> so<00:06:59.590> first<00:07:00.130> and<00:07:00.310> third

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
between your patterns so first and third

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.210 
between your patterns so first and third
this<00:07:01.300> will<00:07:01.510> be<00:07:01.630> second<00:07:01.960> and<00:07:01.990> third<00:07:02.260> second<00:07:03.130> or

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
this will be second and third second or

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.250 
this will be second and third second or
third<00:07:03.370> verse<00:07:03.640> third<00:07:04.000> 1st<00:07:04.330> and<00:07:04.510> 3rd<00:07:04.660> 2nd<00:07:05.110> 3rd

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
third verse third 1st and 3rd 2nd 3rd

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.220 
third verse third 1st and 3rd 2nd 3rd
2nd<00:07:05.770> 3rd<00:07:05.920> 1st<00:07:06.280> 3rd<00:07:06.600> 1st<00:07:07.600> and<00:07:07.810> 3rd<00:07:08.020> so<00:07:08.770> that<00:07:09.580> way

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
2nd 3rd 1st 3rd 1st and 3rd so that way

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.510 
2nd 3rd 1st 3rd 1st and 3rd so that way
and<00:07:11.230> then<00:07:11.860> when<00:07:11.980> you<00:07:12.040> get<00:07:12.130> better<00:07:12.310> you<00:07:12.490> can

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
and then when you get better you can

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:28.430 
and then when you get better you can
just<00:07:12.760> play<00:07:13.060> 1st<00:07:13.450> and<00:07:13.660> 3rd<00:07:13.810> the<00:07:13.930> whole<00:07:14.050> thing

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.140 

but<00:07:29.440> I<00:07:29.560> wanted<00:07:29.740> to<00:07:29.830> move<00:07:29.979> fast<00:07:30.250> I<00:07:30.550> would<00:07:30.610> use<00:07:30.940> my

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
but I wanted to move fast I would use my

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:43.119 
but I wanted to move fast I would use my
second<00:07:31.479> and<00:07:31.569> third

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:43.129 

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:48.800 

like<00:07:44.129> that<00:07:45.080> alright<00:07:46.080> thanks<00:07:46.409> and<00:07:46.530> enjoy
