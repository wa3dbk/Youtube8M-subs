I'm staying at this thing and I'm just
really<00:03:32.160> trying<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.519> figure<00:03:32.700> out<00:03:33.300> what<00:03:33.690> it's

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
really trying to figure out what it's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.150 
really trying to figure out what it's
going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.019> look<00:03:34.080> like<00:03:34.230> before<00:03:35.510> it's<00:03:36.510> done<00:03:37.160> so

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
going to look like before it's done so

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.460 
going to look like before it's done so
you<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.900> really<00:03:40.200> working

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
you know that that is really working

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.380 
you know that that is really working
since<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.100> freestyling<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.790> they<00:03:41.970> all<00:03:42.150> really

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
since I'm freestyling it they all really

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.650 
since I'm freestyling it they all really
got<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:43.320> know<00:03:43.640> cut<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> piece<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.030> then<00:03:45.390> kind

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
got a you know cut a piece and then kind

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.770 
got a you know cut a piece and then kind
of<00:03:45.720> see<00:03:45.930> where<00:03:46.110> those<00:03:46.500> see<00:03:46.980> how<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.280> fits<00:03:47.780> we're

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
of see where those see how it fits we're

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.330 
of see where those see how it fits we're
going<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.050> shake<00:03:49.260> them<00:03:49.470> gonna<00:03:49.680> make<00:03:50.010> or

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
going to shake them gonna make or

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.900 
going to shake them gonna make or
attempt<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.030> make<00:03:52.070> everything<00:03:53.070> works<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.550> think

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
attempt to make everything works I think

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.980 
attempt to make everything works I think
it's<00:03:54.030> gonna<00:03:54.150> work

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
it's gonna work

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.860 
it's gonna work
but<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:58.610> is<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.940> lighting<00:03:59.300> process<00:03:59.420> right

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
but this is the lighting process right

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.690 
but this is the lighting process right
here<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.200> stand<00:04:00.560> at<00:04:00.710> this<00:04:00.830> day<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.070> figuring

out what lines to go with what kind of
curves<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.780> try<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.840> emulate<00:04:11.740> don't<00:04:12.740> have

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
curves to try to emulate don't have

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.850 
curves to try to emulate don't have
every<00:04:13.190> tool<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.640> want<00:04:14.410> but<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.740> know

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:05:18.480 

see<00:04:30.920> what<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.070> come<00:04:31.220> up<00:04:31.280> with

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:26.219 

I<00:05:23.460> was<00:05:24.460> gonna<00:05:24.639> make<00:05:24.849> a<00:05:24.880> whole<00:05:25.210> pizza<00:05:25.449> insert<00:05:26.080> it

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
I was gonna make a whole pizza insert it

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.559 
I was gonna make a whole pizza insert it
in<00:05:26.440> here<00:05:26.470> but<00:05:27.160> I<00:05:27.430> ended<00:05:27.789> up<00:05:27.819> changing<00:05:28.060> my<00:05:28.300> mind

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
in here but I ended up changing my mind

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:34.200 
in here but I ended up changing my mind
so<00:05:28.979> in<00:05:29.979> order<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.840> load<00:05:31.840> up<00:05:32.050> everything

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
so in order to load up everything

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.510 
so in order to load up everything
I<00:05:34.240> think<00:05:35.199> this<00:05:35.349> base<00:05:35.590> plate<00:05:35.740> I'm<00:05:36.160> gonna<00:05:36.370> have

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
I think this base plate I'm gonna have

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.980 
I think this base plate I'm gonna have
to<00:05:36.610> do<00:05:36.759> something<00:05:37.150> different<00:05:37.599> with<00:05:37.630> this<00:05:37.780> base

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
to do something different with this base

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.540 
to do something different with this base
plate<00:05:38.160> but<00:05:39.160> uh<00:05:39.990> essentially<00:05:41.190> you'll<00:05:42.190> sit<00:05:42.430> the

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
plate but uh essentially you'll sit the

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:52.800 
plate but uh essentially you'll sit the
bottle<00:05:42.940> in<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:44.620> base<00:05:44.800> plate<00:05:51.509> it's<00:05:52.509> kind<00:05:52.750> of

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
bottle in the base plate it's kind of

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.939 
bottle in the base plate it's kind of
the<00:05:52.870> painting<00:05:53.229> a<00:05:53.349> snot<00:05:53.710> mountain<00:05:54.099> stuff<00:05:58.949> place

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
the painting a snot mountain stuff place

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.760 
the painting a snot mountain stuff place
the<00:06:00.130> bottle<00:06:00.460> in<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.639> face<00:06:00.849> plate<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:01.770> then

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
the bottle in the face plate and then

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.399 
the bottle in the face plate and then
this<00:06:03.099> cover<00:06:03.400> piece<00:06:04.889> will<00:06:05.889> drop<00:06:06.880> down<00:06:07.409> it'll

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
this cover piece will drop down it'll

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.620 
this cover piece will drop down it'll
hold<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.710> bottle

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
hold the bottle

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.940 
hold the bottle
it'll<00:06:11.260> hold<00:06:11.380> a<00:06:11.500> while<00:06:11.650> setting<00:06:12.450> notice<00:06:13.450> it's<00:06:13.630> a

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
it'll hold a while setting notice it's a

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.000 
it'll hold a while setting notice it's a
just<00:06:14.950> recessed<00:06:15.490> in<00:06:15.700> here<00:06:16.410> so<00:06:17.410> it<00:06:17.650> should<00:06:17.680> hold

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
just recessed in here so it should hold

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.100 
just recessed in here so it should hold
the<00:06:18.100> bottle<00:06:18.400> pretty<00:06:18.580> good<00:06:18.850> even<00:06:19.390> even<00:06:19.990> in

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
the bottle pretty good even even in

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.800 
the bottle pretty good even even in
motion<00:06:20.530> not<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.580> mention<00:06:21.760> you<00:06:22.000> got<00:06:22.150> neck<00:06:22.510> right

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
motion not to mention you got neck right

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.240 
motion not to mention you got neck right
here<00:06:23.040> so<00:06:24.040> even<00:06:24.610> if<00:06:24.850> it<00:06:24.970> does<00:06:25.120> move<00:06:25.390> is<00:06:25.570> not<00:06:26.250> I'm

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
here so even if it does move is not I'm

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.560 
here so even if it does move is not I'm
moving<00:06:27.550> a<00:06:27.610> whole<00:06:27.760> lot<00:06:27.970> to<00:06:28.150> where<00:06:28.300> it's<00:06:28.420> gonna

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
moving a whole lot to where it's gonna

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.260 
moving a whole lot to where it's gonna
fall<00:06:28.840> or<00:06:28.990> anything<00:06:29.670> then<00:06:30.670> you'll<00:06:30.880> be<00:06:31.000> able<00:06:31.090> to

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
fall or anything then you'll be able to

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.710 
fall or anything then you'll be able to

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
put the cups in and then the cover piece

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:42.560 
put the cups in and then the cover piece
that<00:06:34.960> goes<00:06:35.080> on<00:06:35.290> top<00:06:35.470> of<00:06:35.680> it
