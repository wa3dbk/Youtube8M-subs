00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
stuff you can see Portland's trying to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.180

when I get subbed out it seems like the
other<00:04:34.750> team<00:04:34.930> goes<00:04:35.139> on<00:04:35.320> a<00:04:35.350> dangerous<00:04:36.220> path

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
other team goes on a dangerous path

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.000 
other team goes on a dangerous path
probably<00:04:37.180> shouldn't<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:38.560> netted<00:04:38.830> me<00:04:38.949> an

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
probably shouldn't it netted me an

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.090 
probably shouldn't it netted me an
assist<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.960> dynamic<00:04:40.960> goals<00:04:41.169> I'm<00:04:41.740> up<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.039> down

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
assist and dynamic goals I'm up and down

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.500 
assist and dynamic goals I'm up and down
on<00:04:42.340> these<00:04:42.460> I'm<00:04:42.580> not<00:04:42.699> really<00:04:42.880> sure<00:04:43.060> how<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.270> feel

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
on these I'm not really sure how to feel

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.770 
on these I'm not really sure how to feel
about<00:04:43.570> them<00:04:44.020> because<00:04:45.150> some<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.180> them<00:04:46.479> just

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
about them because some of them just

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.950 
about them because some of them just
seems<00:04:47.020> really<00:04:47.639> misplaced<00:04:48.639> unrealistic<00:04:49.479> maybe

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
seems really misplaced unrealistic maybe

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.469 
seems really misplaced unrealistic maybe
that's<00:04:50.289> more<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.430> something<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.180> would

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
that's more so something that I would

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.260 
that's more so something that I would

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
saw that little quick clip there I just

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.710

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
Nash and Josh Childress I think that the

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.380 
Nash and Josh Childress I think that the
Suns<00:07:21.100> could<00:07:21.370> have<00:07:21.460> done<00:07:21.610> a<00:07:21.640> lot<00:07:21.910> better<00:07:22.120> than

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.390 
Suns could have done a lot better than

that trade I've heard a lot of things

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.830 
that trade I've heard a lot of things
about<00:07:23.950> the<00:07:24.190> trade<00:07:24.460> logic<00:07:24.880> being<00:07:25.060> totally

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
about the trade logic being totally

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.740 
about the trade logic being totally
whacked<00:07:26.140> this<00:07:26.440> year<00:07:27.000> I'm<00:07:28.000> glad<00:07:28.419> that<00:07:28.600> they

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
whacked this year I'm glad that they

moved<00:07:29.020> Nash<00:07:29.320> but<00:07:29.770> I'm<00:07:30.100> also<00:07:30.370> not<00:07:30.940> glad<00:07:31.360> that<00:07:32.050> we

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169 
moved Nash but I'm also not glad that we

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:33.690 
moved Nash but I'm also not glad that we
got<00:07:32.320> Marcus<00:07:32.650> Thornton<00:07:32.890> I<00:07:33.160> think<00:07:33.370> we<00:07:33.490> could<00:07:33.610> do
