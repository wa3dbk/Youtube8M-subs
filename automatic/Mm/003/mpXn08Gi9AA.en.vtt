00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.130
 sub comrade yesterday May 12th jubisoft rule 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.199
 online presentation of a new full 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.119
 parts of assassin's creed I have accumulated 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.890
 a couple of thoughts on this 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.420
 decided to make such a format 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 First of all it is worth noting that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260
 old plum pro title victor 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.930
 there was no justification in terms of what 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.000
 The project's working call is not rooted and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.250
 moreover, despite the fact that victory 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 there are universal in their essence to the word 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 it can be weakly associated with the current 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.730
 convoy syndicate so there may be 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.649
 waiting for another assassin even though 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 more plot takes us out 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 revolutionary france in england 19th century 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.450
 that is, a jump of almost 100 years and this 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.309
 means the growth of technology by the protagonist 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.620
 now there will be jacob fry which 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.719
 together with your twin sister or 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 going to beat the gang under control 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.709
 over the Templars having gathered their 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.409
 gang naturally with blackjack and 

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:11.189
 hidden blades on the shown passages 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.350
 all dated back to 1868 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.779
 not to note the extremely interesting this 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.099
 period finished builds big ben already 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:19.499
 several decades like 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.810
 formed a system of constables passed 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.149
 wave of emigration of the Irish as well 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 happened more banal things which 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.490
 developers have already reported in the forehead during 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.319
 presentations that can grow the industry 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.469
 capitalist stratification of society 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.630
 blah blah blah 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.549
 some of these things are really big 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.529
 weight ult everything really capable 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.869
 turn assassin's perception of creed 

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:41.490
 the name of the syndicate and generally the idea that 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.829
 have to hang out among criminals 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.409
 brings little ideas about the final 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.599
 assimilation of assassins' credo with gta now 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.700
 in the street it will be possible to steal parables q and 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:53.399
 ride her about seven districts 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.770
 London City but here it is true 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.049
 gta but judging by the passage shown as 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.329
 strangely reminiscent of the mafia is not the first 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.489
 as much the format of the subject as with the view 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.349
 cabins which oddly enough by the 30s 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.170
 years of the twentieth century is not much 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.840
 evolved from the presented 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.849
 since autumn there are musicians in the streets because 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.709
 what's happening is more like 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.200
 famous moving the wine strip 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.520
 thanks to the soundtrack 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.770
 Natural similarity adds the fact 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.020
 that weapons in victorian london already 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.730
 so calm in sight 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.830
 Now our hero is at the disposal of 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.230
 Kukri blade under the cloak 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.700
 hidden in a cane is still a whole arsenal of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.860
 bones of this throwing knives 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.019
 classic 6 charging revolver and 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.940
 not that new pneumatic 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.880
 harpoon that does not seem something 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.370
 above those who are familiar with the arkham series 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.200
 interest was aroused by the new combat system 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.450
 which apparently hand-to-hand fight 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.239
 will have a much bigger role than 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.730
 usually in a series is another thing that looks like 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.680
 all this is incredibly crooked 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.540
 unavailable dogs and besides without 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.000
 frills curve left altogether 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.430
 separate topic of the last presentation on 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.140
 go yubisoft already tired of the rake on 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.480
 which they stumbled out roll out on 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.610
 general review with rand so decided 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.100
 not get along pre-alpha demonstrations 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.720
 version and you really believe in it 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.329
 just because interactive objects 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.700
 manage to fall next to the enemy and that 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.430
 still falls before and in memory still hang 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.220
 the very first texts screenshots unity with 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.290
 its empty streets shorter than 2 + 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.120
 2 you understand that the project is waiting for rather a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.640
 upgrade than already familiar to us 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.829
 downgrade interested music for 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.970
 the inspiration is clearly to draw from the price 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.459
 slave music 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.859
 written for Sherlock Holmes Guy Ritchie 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.739
 the same notes are heard and I must say 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.260
 well for i am the same age you 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.910
 to show already sounds cool in general 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 and a whole syndicate now for me 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.950
 seemed logical evolution of unity 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.109
 evolution which was already in the series in 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.150
 the case with brotherhood gameplay is clearly 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.069
 build up starting from the new round 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.290
 development of this assassin about 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.630
 revolution but for now it all looks 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.400
 extremely doubtful resorts and bad 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.260
 attracts part of the ideological since 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.560
 It will be interesting to play this credo 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.750
 it is clear because unity in the end remained poor 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.810
 it was on samui soil they saved 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.819
 the situation here is shown and boho panacea 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.650
 does not look like all these caravans and 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.200
 appearance of transport takes place only 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.750
 how nice chips have to keep ear 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.159
 eye out for the rest of the news is what 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.099
 it flashed through my mind 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:23.990
 I hope it was interesting to listen with you 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.820
 was watt advice if you liked 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.560
