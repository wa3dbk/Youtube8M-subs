this pen assembly robot was on display
now<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.619> might<00:00:17.010> not<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> most<00:00:17.640> practical

might be easier if if this task was

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.980 
might be easier if if this task was
performed<00:00:28.590> among<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.760> number<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.179> robots<00:00:30.449> along
