attacks<00:01:18.890> every<00:01:19.490> second<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.360> we<00:01:20.479> decided<00:01:20.899> to

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
attacks every second so we decided to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.240 
attacks every second so we decided to
swap<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.200> Tychus<00:01:21.619> for<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.799> character<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.220> a

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
swap a Tychus for the character is a

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.020 
swap a Tychus for the character is a
more<00:01:22.460> noticeable<00:01:22.670> attack<00:01:23.270> animation<00:01:23.869> Tyrande
