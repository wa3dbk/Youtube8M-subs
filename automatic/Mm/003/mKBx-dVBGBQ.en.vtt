00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
confidence feeling confident is really

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.330 
confidence feeling confident is really
about<00:00:32.130> not<00:00:32.820> judging<00:00:33.809> yourself<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> only

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
about not judging yourself the only

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
about not judging yourself the only
reason<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.910> ever<00:00:36.059> feel<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.690> confident<00:00:37.350> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
reason we ever feel not confident is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.080 
reason we ever feel not confident is
because<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.280> thinking<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.730> need<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.969> be

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because we're thinking we need to be

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
because we're thinking we need to be
more<00:00:39.300> better<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:39.870> different<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.620> way

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
more better or different in some way

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.830 
more better or different in some way
we're<00:00:41.280> buying<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.149> beliefs<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.690> were

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
we're buying into some beliefs that were

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
we're buying into some beliefs that were
less<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.890> we're<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.370> need<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> be

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
less than and so we're like I need to be

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
less than and so we're like I need to be
more<00:00:45.180> confident<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.530> more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
more confident but you can have more

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.010 
more confident but you can have more
confidence<00:00:46.829> immediately<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.629> stop

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
confidence immediately if you just stop

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
confidence immediately if you just stop
judging<00:00:49.469> yourself<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.340> even<00:00:50.789> looked<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
judging yourself I even looked up the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.520 
judging yourself I even looked up the
word<00:00:51.360> confidence<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
word confidence and here are the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
word confidence and here are the
definitions<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> means<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.760> feeling

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
definitions of what it means a feeling

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350 
definitions of what it means a feeling
or<00:00:54.750> consciousness<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.590> one's<00:00:55.890> power<00:00:56.430> that's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
or consciousness of one's power that's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.990 
or consciousness of one's power that's
key<00:00:58.100> because<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.250> looking<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.730> everything

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
key because you're looking at everything

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.639

makes you uniquely you I think why we
feel<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:35.250> confident<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.689> look<00:01:37.110> at

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
feel not confident is because we look at

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
feel not confident is because we look at
