when the nose tip also moves and yets

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.100 
when the nose tip also moves and yets
usually<00:00:57.890> when<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.700> support<00:00:59.060> is<00:00:59.210> even<00:00:59.570> weaker

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.430 
usually when the support is even weaker
then<00:01:00.860> in<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.550> other<00:01:01.670> cases<00:01:01.970> if<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.110> think<00:01:03.320> of

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
then in the other cases if you think of

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.149 
then in the other cases if you think of
a<00:01:04.030> nasal<00:01:05.030> tip<00:01:05.180> support<00:01:05.659> which<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:06.259> primarily<00:01:07.009> a

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
a nasal tip support which is primarily a

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.609 
a nasal tip support which is primarily a
tripod<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.509> shape<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.990> cartilages

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
tripod of the shape of the cartilages

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.370 
tripod of the shape of the cartilages
and<00:01:09.650> supported<00:01:10.400> also<00:01:10.549> by<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:10.970> septum<00:01:11.540> it's

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
and supported also by the septum it's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.190 
and supported also by the septum it's
almost<00:01:12.710> like<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.210> three-legged<00:01:14.210> stool<00:01:14.390> with

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
almost like a three-legged stool with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.649 
almost like a three-legged stool with
one<00:01:15.830> leg<00:01:16.460> that's<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.850> little<00:01:17.030> bit<00:01:17.119> shorter<00:01:17.570> and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
one leg that's a little bit shorter and

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.709 
one leg that's a little bit shorter and
makes<00:01:17.900> it<00:01:18.079> drop<00:01:18.579> downwards<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:20.390> effort

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
makes it drop downwards and the effort

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.580 
makes it drop downwards and the effort
is<00:01:21.079> primarily<00:01:21.829> to<00:01:22.520> shorten<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.149> longer<00:01:23.659> legs

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
is primarily to shorten the longer legs

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.399 
is primarily to shorten the longer legs
of<00:01:24.859> support<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.640> rotate<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.990> tip<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.320> the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
of support and rotate the tip of the

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.370 
of support and rotate the tip of the
nose<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.740> relation<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.189> the<00:01:28.460> facial<00:01:28.820> plane

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
nose in relation to the facial plane

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.279 
nose in relation to the facial plane
this<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.619> sometimes<00:01:30.859> a<00:01:31.630> simple<00:01:32.630> intervention

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
this is sometimes a simple intervention

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.849 
this is sometimes a simple intervention
sometimes<00:01:33.530> needs<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.130> be<00:01:35.079> stabilized<00:01:36.079> more<00:01:36.590> to

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
sometimes needs to be stabilized more to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.050 
sometimes needs to be stabilized more to
the<00:01:36.950> bridge<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.310> nose<00:01:37.399> in<00:01:37.759> particular

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
the bridge of the nose in particular

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.749 
the bridge of the nose in particular
when<00:01:38.600> there<00:01:38.899> is<00:01:39.020> considerable<00:01:39.799> shortening<00:01:40.549> to

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
when there is considerable shortening to

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.179 
when there is considerable shortening to
achieve<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.140> situation<00:01:42.350> the

achieve and in that situation the

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.789 
achieve and in that situation the
traditional<00:01:43.880> approach<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.479> shortening<00:01:45.049> the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
traditional approach of shortening the

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.919 
traditional approach of shortening the
lower<00:01:45.979> part<00:01:46.249> of<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.429> septum<00:01:46.969> will<00:01:47.359> not<00:01:47.569> work

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
lower part of the septum will not work

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.749 
lower part of the septum will not work
by<00:01:48.380> itself<00:01:49.630> there<00:01:50.630> are<00:01:50.659> situations<00:01:51.319> when<00:01:51.770> the

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
by itself there are situations when the

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.599 
by itself there are situations when the
tip<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.359> nose<00:01:53.649> looks<00:01:54.649> like<00:01:54.920> it's<00:01:55.130> drooping

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
tip of the nose looks like it's drooping

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.819 
tip of the nose looks like it's drooping
but<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.880> nose<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.210> itself<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.749> short<00:01:57.109> that's

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
but the nose in itself is short that's

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.840 
but the nose in itself is short that's
because<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:58.549> base<00:01:58.789> of<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.119> columella<00:01:59.539> is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
because the base of the columella is

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.459 
because the base of the columella is
retracted<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:01.999> further<00:02:02.359> back<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:02.959> in<00:02:03.409> a

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
retracted this further back and in a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.739 
retracted this further back and in a
situation<00:02:04.009> like<00:02:04.039> this<00:02:04.159> just<00:02:05.030> shortening<00:02:05.630> the

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
situation like this just shortening the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.469 
situation like this just shortening the
nose<00:02:05.929> is<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.200> wrong<00:02:06.530> thing<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:06.859> do<00:02:07.189> in<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:08.149> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
nose is the wrong thing to do in in this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.809 
nose is the wrong thing to do in in this
sort<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.890> scenarios<00:02:09.890> it's<00:02:10.100> better<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.550> build

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
sort of scenarios it's better to build

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.360 
sort of scenarios it's better to build
up<00:02:11.060> some<00:02:11.690> support<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.350> volume<00:02:12.740> at<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.130> base

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
up some support and volume at the base

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.940 
up some support and volume at the base
of<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.670> columella<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.390> perhaps<00:02:14.810> change<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
of the columella and perhaps change the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.710 
of the columella and perhaps change the
shape<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.459> nasal<00:02:16.610> tip<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.209> looks<00:02:17.510> like

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
shape of the nasal tip so it looks like

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.290 
shape of the nasal tip so it looks like
it's<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.020> little<00:02:18.290> bit<00:02:18.410> hard<00:02:18.850> this<00:02:19.850> can<00:02:19.910> be

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
it's a little bit hard this can be

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.539 
it's a little bit hard this can be
achieved<00:02:20.390> either<00:02:21.110> through<00:02:21.709> open<00:02:22.159> or<00:02:22.310> closed

increasingly<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:28.550> interest<00:02:29.090> about<00:02:29.330> using

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
increasingly the interest about using

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.990 
increasingly the interest about using
some<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.200> ligaments<00:02:30.590> inside<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.280> nose<00:02:31.490> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
some of the ligaments inside the nose to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.470 
some of the ligaments inside the nose to
add<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> stability<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> not<00:02:34.580> just<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.240> use

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
add to the stability so not just to use

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.020 
add to the stability so not just to use
the<00:02:35.860> relationship<00:02:36.860> between<00:02:37.000> cartilages<00:02:38.000> in

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
the relationship between cartilages in

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.600 
the relationship between cartilages in
the<00:02:38.360> nose<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> framework<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:39.920> also<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.310> use

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the nose the framework but also to use

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.880 
the nose the framework but also to use
some<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.720> ligaments<00:02:42.200> between<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
some of the the ligaments between the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.280 
some of the the ligaments between the
skin<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:44.000> cartridges<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.750> add<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.170> this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
skin and the cartridges to add to this

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.400 
skin and the cartridges to add to this
support<00:02:46.420> ultimately<00:02:47.420> what<00:02:47.720> we<00:02:47.870> want<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.230> see

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
support ultimately what we want to see

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.000 
support ultimately what we want to see
in<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.680> end<00:02:48.710> is<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.690> nose<00:02:50.930> starts<00:02:51.830> a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
in the end is that the nose starts a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.290 
in the end is that the nose starts a
little<00:02:52.490> bit<00:02:53.110> lifted<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:54.350> its<00:02:54.740> shape<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.340> when

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
little bit lifted in its shape and when

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.840 
little bit lifted in its shape and when
smiling<00:02:56.870> although<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> lip<00:02:57.830> moves<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.670> tip

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
smiling although the lip moves the tip
