00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.899
 we have not talked about for some time 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.290
 prius the mother of all hybrid cars 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.110
 that in 2012 celebrates 15 years of honor 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.209
 career 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.889
 in reality there are several reasons for 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.230
 deepen the technologies that are 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.570
 at the base of this toyota car because i 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.039
 results are important and concrete 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.890
 it has also been shown by the very recent 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.529
 yaris hybrid and in our tests and use in 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.840
 city â€‹â€‹has made the 20 with no effort 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.840
 liter and with petrol at 2 euros 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.790
 I don't know if I explain myself well at the extreme 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.309
 opposite of the hybrid yaris for the 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.960
 size has just arrived on the track 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.480
 prius class we can discuss for hours 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.610
 on the aesthetic beauty of this prius 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.930
 I don't say much to myself though 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.090
 what is not in question is 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.720
 energy efficiency of the system 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.670
 toyota hybrid synergy drive like a car 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.110
 this is able to use the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.180
 fuel in the best way 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.320
 so a good saving and even less 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.630
 polluting substances 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.430
 let's make a brief brief review 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.780
 on the hybrid engine is no longer a mystery 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.780
 for no one but you never know 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.370
 it's like having two engines that help each other 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 each other there is a petrol engine 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.540
 the prius is relatively small 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.140
 plus is a 1800 from 99 horses that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140
 works normally 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 but in times of need when needed 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.470
 all the power comes to the aid a 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.300
 80 horsepower electric motor that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.729
 takes the power from a battery pack 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.330
 go the batteries are recharged during the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.130
 march 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.680
 using a part of the power of the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.640
 heat engine or even by operating the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.640
 brake or downhill 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.720
 in short, a great advantage in the city and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.490
 with the routes and with many stops 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.560
 here is a little less on the highway and for the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.300
 first time this hybrid technology is 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.140
 available on a seven-person minivan 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.970
 big and spacious places the whole queue is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 been redesigned to accommodate a 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.720
 large trunk or alternatively two 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.520
 additional seats 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.410
 these can be extracted from the bottom of the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.239
 it is not that they are with few moves 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.070
 comfortable or padded like a seat 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.940
 normal but for children go 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.950
 very well 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.110
 or even for adults but not for 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.209
 long time when i 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.810
 seats remains available a compartment 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.580
 not very large luggage only 385 liters is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.910
 true, however, that the modularity of the seat 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.430
 central allows load options 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.280
 but back to our two world there is ad 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.230
 having two instead of one the fact is 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.450
 that gasoline engines often do not 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.459
 works ideally for example 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.870
 when you start from a standstill it takes a 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.570
 good starting point for moving 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.640
 to the mass of the prius plus that it is 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.239
 incidentally it is not a feather with 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.980
 driver on board is 1644 kg and here 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.019
 the electric motor comes to the aid 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
 combining his push with the 4 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.690
 gasoline cylinders and levels the torque e 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.180
 lowers city consumption 17 km with a 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.510
 state liter nearly 15 kilometers with a 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.940
 liter 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.890
 not bad given the size when the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.610
 batteries are fully charged you do 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.610
 best mediums 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.930
 with this new prius the hybrid range 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.440
 of the toyota is practically complete 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.790
 there are little ones like the yaris auris e 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.100
 now even the minivan consume of 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.200
 less means also polluting less e 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.650
 do good to the air we breathe from 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.650
 pedaling
