to writing styles and preference I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.100 
to writing styles and preference I
personally<00:00:50.670> prefer<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.480> trim<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.930> on

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
personally prefer to have my trim up on

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
personally prefer to have my trim up on
the<00:00:52.379> flat<00:00:52.620> water<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> bow<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.789> high<00:00:54.000> this

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the flat water so the bow is high this

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 
the flat water so the bow is high this
ensures<00:00:55.500> less<00:00:55.829> drag<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> water<00:00:56.640> due<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
ensures less drag on the water due to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.049 
ensures less drag on the water due to
less<00:00:57.449> ski<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> water<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.649> speed<00:00:59.059> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
less ski in the water at speed the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880 
less ski in the water at speed the
advantages<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.809> high<00:01:01.109> speed<00:01:01.440> touring

advantages for high speed touring
however<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.140> downside<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.799> have

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
however a downside is that I will have

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
however a downside is that I will have
some<00:01:05.220> instability<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:05.970> ski<00:01:06.450> wobble<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:06.930> high

some instability or ski wobble at high

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
some instability or ski wobble at high
speed<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.100> slight<00:01:08.430> loss<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.000> fast<00:01:09.479> steering

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
speed and a slight loss of fast steering

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.310 
speed and a slight loss of fast steering
response<00:01:10.939> if<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.299> wanting<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.780> dynamic

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
response if I was wanting more dynamic

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
response if I was wanting more dynamic
steering<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> trim<00:01:14.610> set<00:01:14.939> low

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
steering I would have the trim set low

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.230 
steering I would have the trim set low
for<00:01:16.110> example<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.070> skiing<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.549> slalom<00:01:17.850> boy

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
for example if I was skiing a slalom boy

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.210 
for example if I was skiing a slalom boy
course<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.930> would<00:01:19.259> ensure<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.070> have

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
course I would ensure that I would have

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.490 
course I would ensure that I would have
the<00:01:20.340> trim<00:01:20.549> seating<00:01:20.909> down<00:01:21.150> they<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.140> give<00:01:22.320> me

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the trim seating down they would give me

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
the trim seating down they would give me
more<00:01:22.710> dynamic<00:01:23.250> steering<00:01:23.490> by<00:01:23.880> having<00:01:24.150> more<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
more dynamic steering by having more of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
more dynamic steering by having more of
the<00:01:24.630> front<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> ski<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.799> water<00:01:26.040> which

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the front of the ski in the water which

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.380 
the front of the ski in the water which
slightly<00:01:26.970> reduces<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.930> top<00:01:28.200> speed<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.390> would

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
slightly reduces my top speed I would

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390 
slightly reduces my top speed I would
recommend<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.170> play<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.619> trim<00:01:31.950> whilst

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
recommend that you play with trim whilst

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
recommend that you play with trim whilst
riding<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> gain<00:01:33.210> an<00:01:33.390> optimum<00:01:33.840> setting<00:01:34.259> for

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
riding and gain an optimum setting for

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.469 
riding and gain an optimum setting for
the<00:01:34.560> conditions<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.250> riding<00:01:35.729> him<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the conditions you are riding him you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.240 
the conditions you are riding him you
will<00:01:36.630> become<00:01:36.780> proficient<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:38.040> some

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
will become proficient at this with some

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.120 
will become proficient at this with some
practice<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> also<00:01:40.229> worth<00:01:40.650> considering

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
practice it is also worth considering

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
practice it is also worth considering
that<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.000> carrying<00:01:42.329> excessive

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that the added weight on your ski will

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.969 
that the added weight on your ski will
affect<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> trim<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.299> either<00:01:48.780> accentuate<00:01:49.619> or

you are riding with a passenger on the
rear<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> ski<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.340> bow<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.579> sitting

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
rear of the ski and the bow is sitting

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850 
rear of the ski and the bow is sitting
high<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.899> ski<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.530> sitting

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
high the ski would be sitting

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.380 
high the ski would be sitting
proportionally<00:01:59.579> much<00:01:59.759> higher<00:02:00.090> than<00:02:00.329> normal

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
proportionally much higher than normal

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.780 
proportionally much higher than normal
then<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.870> would<00:02:02.020> most<00:02:02.230> likely<00:02:02.560> compensate<00:02:03.310> by

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
then you would most likely compensate by

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.810 
then you would most likely compensate by
bringing<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.270> trim<00:02:04.480> down<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.780> little

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
bringing the trim down a little

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.010 
bringing the trim down a little
consequently<00:02:06.820> if<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.210> are<00:02:07.360> carrying<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.810> load

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
consequently if you are carrying a load

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.080 
consequently if you are carrying a load
at<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.440> front<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> ski<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.670> would<00:02:09.820> trim

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
at the front of the ski you would trim

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.350 
at the front of the ski you would trim
