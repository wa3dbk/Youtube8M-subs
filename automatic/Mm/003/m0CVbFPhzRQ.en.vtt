00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.689
 major discovery of a university biology research group the 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.690
 molara karst cave meets compassion yes on the outskirts of 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.120
 Palermo was famous until yesterday for the numerous fossil remains of the extinct 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.369
 Quaternary fauna and the presence of prehistoric human populations 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.640
 today the environmental association of ecological research groups with his 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.230
 national president umberto balistreri 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.420
 which the Superintendency for Cultural Heritage entrusted with the management of the cave but 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.259
 rightly it was a discovery 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.290
 systematic monitoring within the cavity has always been followed 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.739
 with above the dimensini starting from 2007 of the research group of the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.409
 Department of Biology of the University of Catania of which they do 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.039
 part professor fat rosary and doctor maria teresa schettino 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.610
 3 specimens of a new species of insect have been found 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.360
 to the order of the beetles never found before in a cave 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.370
 the specimens all three males were collected visually near 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.880
 logical escribiÃ³ already long positioned in different environments of the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.610
 cavity 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.210
 so far no fendi 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.650
 fortunately, however, the researchers declare the discovery of the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.780
 male specimens allowed comparison with groups and children 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.350
 the attribution to a new systematic grouping 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.990
 the finding of female dvds will complete the picture on the biology of 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.400
 this species that is currently unknown 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.230
 the somewhat 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.590
 eheh particular in that and this species had never been found in 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.750
 sicily entu trenitalia 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.909
 rt only 14 180 are known worldwide 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.750
 that there is no need for them to have started 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.070
 1978 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.070
 until today they had only been discovered 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.090
 since 2007 and we are working 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.850
 this was the first discovery I've ever made is made is 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.370
 moke 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.200
 i'm fotolog 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 the cave holds other surprises for us 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.070
 a grain of sand is added 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.829
 if therefore a new one 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.589
 fish 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:20.469
 to what the heritage of knowledge if of humanity is a 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.519
 grain of sand for you 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.019
 they have an intent 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.170
 because until today help was not podda 8 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.940
 he didn't know you 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.769
 and so 4 as it is I love to say to student feet 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.230
 eeee then 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.980
 if we leave we grow and then down vote the head of our tiflologia we will die 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.040
 what we find out ahahah will remain if we celebrate 13 - obviously - i 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.390
 truly tari maybe they will be

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:06.499
 validly 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:12.639
 eheheheh unicabas cultivates right now is a molecule that is really true 82
