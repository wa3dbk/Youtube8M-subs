 hello youtube friends 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.110
 Álvaro speaks to them of free channel and they 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.420
 I want to show how to solve this 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:30.029
 problem on the samsung galaxy s2 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:34.440
 this error is common in both the s2 and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.420
 in the s3 that I had to see what 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.350
 we have to do it is very simple 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.350
 we have to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.220
 and remove the battery 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.500
 to the phone 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:02.010
 we remove the battery the phone 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:05.750
 for about 5 seconds we count 5 seconds 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.750
 we re-insert the battery 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.810
 we put the battery cover 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.690
 we ensure that it is well cap 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.240
 and we light 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.240
 3 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.499
 this error is due to overheating 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.499
 of the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.280
 the phone repeatedly or 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.520
 It is also due to the overload of 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.510
 applications that the phone has with 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.510
 which is recommended 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:02:00.300
 not synchronize accounts youtube 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.390
 neither of facebook nor of google 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.350
 and now we have again operational 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.350
 our phone 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.720
 that simple 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.459
