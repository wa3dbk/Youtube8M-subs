this<00:01:22.660> case<00:01:22.899> I<00:01:23.140> free<00:01:23.440> hand<00:01:23.680> drew<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.520> contours

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
this case I free hand drew the contours

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.840 
this case I free hand drew the contours
I<00:01:25.479> wanted<00:01:25.810> on<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:25.960> big<00:01:26.260> sheet<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.500> Steel

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
I wanted on the big sheet of Steel

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.580 
I wanted on the big sheet of Steel
I'll<00:01:29.150> take<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.450> over<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.750> plasma<00:01:30.110> cutter<00:01:30.350> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
I'll take it over the plasma cutter and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.749 
I'll take it over the plasma cutter and
cut<00:01:31.369> out<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.520> profiles<00:01:35.799> after<00:01:36.799> rough<00:01:37.490> cutting

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
cut out the profiles after rough cutting

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.340 
cut out the profiles after rough cutting
it<00:01:37.970> on<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.210> plasma<00:01:38.600> cutter<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.869> think<00:01:39.170> it'll<00:01:39.320> go

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
it on the plasma cutter I think it'll go

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.100 
it on the plasma cutter I think it'll go
to<00:01:39.440> bell<00:01:39.650> founder<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.250> refined<00:01:40.729> you
