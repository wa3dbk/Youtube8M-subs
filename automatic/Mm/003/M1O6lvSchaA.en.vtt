00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.179 
can either leave it like that and it
will<00:01:27.720> make<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> weird<00:01:28.560> layered

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
will make like a weird layered

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.590 
will make like a weird layered
consistency<00:01:29.790> which<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.540> of
