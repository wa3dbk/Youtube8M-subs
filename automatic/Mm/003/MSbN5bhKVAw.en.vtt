one<00:00:00.510> two

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.130 

okay<00:00:18.790> first<00:00:19.090> off<00:00:19.330> what<00:00:19.540> you<00:00:19.660> really<00:00:19.869> need<00:00:19.990> is<00:00:20.110> a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
okay first off what you really need is a

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.890 
okay first off what you really need is a
file<00:00:20.530> and<00:00:21.460> this<00:00:21.610> is<00:00:21.760> an<00:00:21.880> auger<00:00:22.029> bit<00:00:22.210> file<00:00:22.660> it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
file and this is an auger bit file it

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.250 
file and this is an auger bit file it
has<00:00:22.930> teeth<00:00:23.440> on<00:00:23.710> one<00:00:24.460> edge<00:00:24.790> and<00:00:25.119> no<00:00:25.869> teeth<00:00:26.110> on

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
has teeth on one edge and no teeth on

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.440 
has teeth on one edge and no teeth on
the<00:00:26.349> flat<00:00:26.560> side<00:00:26.800> on<00:00:27.040> one<00:00:27.279> end<00:00:27.490> and<00:00:28.270> on<00:00:28.420> the

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
the flat side on one end and on the

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.540 
the flat side on one end and on the
other<00:00:28.720> end<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.260> just<00:00:29.290> the<00:00:29.619> opposite<00:00:30.099> where<00:00:30.369> it

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
other end is just the opposite where it

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.270 
other end is just the opposite where it
has<00:00:30.820> teeth<00:00:31.750> on<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.080> flat<00:00:32.349> side<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:33.100> can<00:00:33.250> see

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
has teeth on the flat side you can see

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.510 
has teeth on the flat side you can see
that<00:00:33.610> there<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.059> no<00:00:34.750> teeth<00:00:34.989> on<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.350> edge<00:00:35.559> this

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
that there and no teeth on the edge this

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.160 
that there and no teeth on the edge this
protects<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.090> bit<00:00:37.270> when<00:00:37.449> you're<00:00:37.540> using<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.960> you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
protects a bit when you're using it you

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.720 
protects a bit when you're using it you
could<00:00:38.440> also<00:00:38.559> use<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:38.770> triangular<00:00:39.160> file<00:00:39.460> on<00:00:39.670> a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
could also use a triangular file on a

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.220 
could also use a triangular file on a
pinch<00:00:40.000> if<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.300> didn't<00:00:40.540> have<00:00:40.629> an<00:00:40.780> auger<00:00:40.900> file

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
pinch if you didn't have an auger file

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.080 
pinch if you didn't have an auger file
all<00:00:41.710> right<00:00:41.890> first<00:00:42.340> things<00:00:42.610> first<00:00:42.670> on<00:00:43.000> the

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
all right first things first on the

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.030 
all right first things first on the
outside<00:00:43.420> of<00:00:43.540> these<00:00:43.660> are<00:00:43.780> bits<00:00:44.050> never<00:00:44.530> touch

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
outside of these are bits never touch

outside of these are bits never touch
the<00:00:45.340> outside<00:00:45.519> edges<00:00:46.210> with<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.320> file<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:48.040> want

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
the outside edges with the file you want

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.100 
the outside edges with the file you want
to<00:00:48.250> maintain<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.970> diameter<00:00:49.479> of<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.629> bit<00:00:49.870> if

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
to maintain the diameter of the bit if

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.600 
to maintain the diameter of the bit if
you<00:00:50.229> start<00:00:50.470> following<00:00:50.650> on<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.040> outside<00:00:51.370> it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
you start following on the outside it

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.479 
you start following on the outside it
will<00:00:51.670> mess<00:00:51.879> up<00:00:51.909> your<00:00:52.239> whole<00:00:52.390> size<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:54.309> these

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
will mess up your whole size what these

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.210 
will mess up your whole size what these
little<00:00:54.820> wings<00:00:55.239> do<00:00:55.540> here<00:00:55.839> is<00:00:56.019> score<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.010> hole

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
little wings do here is score the hole

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.189 
little wings do here is score the hole
when<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.760> bit<00:00:57.940> goes<00:00:58.150> around<00:00:58.479> so<00:00:58.839> that<00:00:58.870> way

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
when the bit goes around so that way

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.530 
when the bit goes around so that way
you'll<00:00:59.680> make<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.129> nice<00:01:00.309> clean<00:01:00.519> hole<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.510> you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
you'll make a nice clean hole so you

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.570 
you'll make a nice clean hole so you
file<00:01:01.900> on<00:01:02.080> the<00:01:02.199> inside<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:02.739> those<00:01:02.860> wings<00:01:03.190> just

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
file on the inside of those wings just

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.750 
file on the inside of those wings just
like<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:04.379> real<00:01:05.379> careful<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.430> try<00:01:06.700> to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
like this real careful and try to

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.280 
like this real careful and try to
maintain<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.330> bail<00:01:07.510> that's<00:01:07.780> already<00:01:08.080> there

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
maintain the bail that's already there

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.960 
maintain the bail that's already there
some<00:01:08.680> of<00:01:08.830> them<00:01:08.950> are<00:01:09.040> kind<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.280> curved<00:01:09.549> so<00:01:09.909> you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
some of them are kind of curved so you

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.930 
some of them are kind of curved so you
might<00:01:10.210> make<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.650> sloping<00:01:11.650> curved<00:01:11.979> cut<00:01:12.460> as<00:01:12.700> you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
might make a sloping curved cut as you

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.990 
might make a sloping curved cut as you
go<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.479> file<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.890> sure<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.100> do<00:01:15.250> both<00:01:15.460> wings

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
go the file make sure you do both wings

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.760 
go the file make sure you do both wings
on<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.390> inside<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:17.110> get<00:01:17.260> a<00:01:17.290> burr<00:01:17.500> on<00:01:17.530> the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
on the inside you get a burr on the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.469 
on the inside you get a burr on the
outside<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.310> take<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.520> back<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.299> leather

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
outside to take you back of a leather

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.660 
outside to take you back of a leather
belt<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.020> should<00:01:20.200> have<00:01:20.399> strop<00:01:21.399> it<00:01:21.549> off

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
belt and you should have strop it off

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.529 
belt and you should have strop it off
there<00:01:22.229> wouldn't<00:01:23.229> be<00:01:23.320> much<00:01:23.439> of<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.680> birdie<00:01:24.100> howl

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
there wouldn't be much of a birdie howl

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.480 
there wouldn't be much of a birdie howl
now<00:01:25.539> for<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.899> main<00:01:26.170> primary<00:01:26.680> bevels<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
now for the main primary bevels on the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.429 
now for the main primary bevels on the
bit<00:01:27.820> these<00:01:28.359> are<00:01:28.570> like<00:01:28.689> little<00:01:28.869> chisels<00:01:29.380> that

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
bit these are like little chisels that

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.230 
bit these are like little chisels that
go<00:01:29.619> around<00:01:29.829> a<00:01:29.979> circle<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.549> hog<00:01:30.729> out<00:01:30.909> all<00:01:31.119> the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
go around a circle and hog out all the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.510 
go around a circle and hog out all the
material<00:01:31.719> so<00:01:32.619> really<00:01:32.920> all<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:33.130> want<00:01:33.159> to<00:01:33.340> do<00:01:33.399> is

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
material so really all you want to do is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.249 
material so really all you want to do is
just<00:01:33.670> sharpen<00:01:34.060> means<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.810> like<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.109> would<00:01:35.229> a

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
just sharpen means just like you would a

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.139 
just sharpen means just like you would a
chisel<00:01:35.679> you<00:01:35.770> can<00:01:36.340> get<00:01:36.640> your<00:01:36.789> block<00:01:36.969> of<00:01:37.000> wood

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
chisel you can get your block of wood

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.270 
chisel you can get your block of wood
there<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.659> hold<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.990> bit<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.409> just<00:01:39.100> make<00:01:39.250> some

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
there to hold the bit and just make some

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.429 
there to hold the bit and just make some
light<00:01:39.640> passes<00:01:40.179> across<00:01:40.299> there<00:01:40.750> get<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.170> nice

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
light passes across there get you a nice

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.190 
light passes across there get you a nice
angle<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.250> bit<00:01:42.399> so<00:01:42.579> it'll<00:01:42.820> sit<00:01:43.030> like<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.479> you

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
angle the bit so it'll sit like that you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.510 
angle the bit so it'll sit like that you
can<00:01:44.320> see<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.530> angle<00:01:44.590> here<00:01:44.950> about<00:01:45.159> like<00:01:45.189> that

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
can see the angle here about like that

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.639 
can see the angle here about like that
now<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.450> get<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.780> your<00:01:46.899> good<00:01:47.049> angle<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.499> that

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
now to get you your good angle so that

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.289 
now to get you your good angle so that
we<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:47.979> keep<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.520> file<00:01:48.670> flat<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.270> your

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
we can keep the file flat to your

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.810 
we can keep the file flat to your
surface<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.990> helps<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.320> reference<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.920> just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
surface it helps you reference it just

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
there it should work fine we can get

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.660 
there it should work fine we can get
real<00:01:55.899> picky<00:01:56.170> about<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.439> bevels<00:01:56.770> angles<00:01:57.429> or

real picky about the bevels angles or

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.630 
real picky about the bevels angles or
anything<00:01:58.170> okay<00:01:59.200> one<00:01:59.439> trick<00:01:59.829> for<00:01:59.859> that<00:02:00.130> tip<00:02:00.399> is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
anything okay one trick for that tip is

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.669 
anything okay one trick for that tip is
to<00:02:00.759> put<00:02:00.939> some<00:02:01.119> valve<00:02:01.390> grinding<00:02:01.810> paste<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.319> the

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
to put some valve grinding paste in the

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.559 
to put some valve grinding paste in the
hole<00:02:02.920> there<00:02:03.249> that<00:02:03.280> you've<00:02:03.579> kind<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:03.850> drilled

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
hole there that you've kind of drilled

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.080 
hole there that you've kind of drilled
already<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.079> then<00:02:05.530> run<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:05.920> bit<00:02:06.189> in<00:02:06.429> and<00:02:06.969> out

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
already and then run that bit in and out

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.090 
already and then run that bit in and out
in<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.479> out<00:02:07.569> to<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:07.929> screw<00:02:08.259> tip<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:08.800> the

that<00:02:12.069> screw<00:02:12.580> tip<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.060> make<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.390> pull<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.050> bit

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
that screw tip and make it pull the bit

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.089 
that screw tip and make it pull the bit
through<00:02:14.590> better

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
through better

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.640 
through better
all<00:02:16.879> right<00:02:16.999> this<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.329> center<00:02:17.749> bit<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.349> it's

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
all right this is a center bit and it's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.289 
all right this is a center bit and it's
a<00:02:18.769> similar<00:02:19.129> situation<00:02:19.370> where<00:02:19.849> you<00:02:19.939> do<00:02:20.150> not

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
a similar situation where you do not

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.879 
a similar situation where you do not
want<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:20.629> touch<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.049> outside<00:02:21.409> of<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.739> with<00:02:21.859> a

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:21.889 
want to touch the outside of it with a

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.580 
want to touch the outside of it with a
file<00:02:22.189> again<00:02:23.120> that'll<00:02:23.480> mess<00:02:23.659> up<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.079> bit<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
file again that'll mess up the bit and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.830 
file again that'll mess up the bit and
this<00:02:25.489> over<00:02:25.670> here<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:25.969> chisel<00:02:26.180> part<00:02:26.540> that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
this over here is the chisel part that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.349 
this over here is the chisel part that
that<00:02:27.260> hogs<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.129> out<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.090> auger

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
that hogs that out just like the auger

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.259 
that hogs that out just like the auger
bit<00:02:30.099> so<00:02:31.099> which<00:02:31.189> one<00:02:31.370> do<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.549> file<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.879> inside

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
bit so which one do is file the inside

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.179 
bit so which one do is file the inside
of<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.540> spur<00:02:32.959> here<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.590> that's<00:02:33.920> going<00:02:34.129> to

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
of this spur here and that's going to

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.369 
of this spur here and that's going to
score<00:02:34.489> your<00:02:34.670> hole<00:02:34.879> just<00:02:35.269> like<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.930> Ling's<00:02:36.170> on

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
score your hole just like the Ling's on

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.410 
score your hole just like the Ling's on
the<00:02:36.469> article<00:02:36.859> so<00:02:37.189> you<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.459> file<00:02:37.730> inside<00:02:38.209> they

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the article so you just file inside they

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.679 
the article so you just file inside they
see<00:02:38.659> a<00:02:38.689> nice<00:02:39.049> sharp<00:02:39.379> point<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.819> don't<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:41.599> I'd

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
see a nice sharp point I don't think I'd

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.149 
see a nice sharp point I don't think I'd
work<00:02:41.840> too<00:02:41.989> much<00:02:42.109> about<00:02:42.349> birds<00:02:42.620> again<00:02:42.919> but<00:02:43.099> if

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
work too much about birds again but if

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.750 
work too much about birds again but if
you<00:02:43.219> do<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.609> knock<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.790> out<00:02:43.969> for<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.209> bill

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
you do you can knock it out for the bill

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.190 
you do you can knock it out for the bill
after<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.849> get<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.299> point<00:02:47.599> nice<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.019> sharp

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
after you get this point nice and sharp

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.809 
after you get this point nice and sharp
you're<00:02:48.439> going<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.620> move<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.129> main<00:02:49.370> point

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
you're going to move to the main point

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.179 
you're going to move to the main point
of<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:49.969> bit<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.419> it's<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:51.290> may<00:02:51.439> be<00:02:51.500> three<00:02:51.919> flat

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
of the bit and it's it may be three flat

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.849 
of the bit and it's it may be three flat
faces<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:52.939> this<00:02:53.120> one<00:02:53.329> here<00:02:53.540> or<00:02:53.870> two<00:02:54.530> but

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
faces like this one here or two but

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
style all the faces and they'll make a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.379 
style all the faces and they'll make a
nice<00:02:56.900> sharp<00:02:57.230> point<00:02:57.469> together

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
this one also came with a larger wing

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.879 
this one also came with a larger wing
can<00:03:28.909> see<00:03:29.090> right<00:03:29.299> there<00:03:29.590> seen<00:03:30.590> cut<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.769> whole

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
can see right there seen cut a whole

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.289 
can see right there seen cut a whole
bunch<00:03:31.069> of<00:03:31.129> different<00:03:31.220> size<00:03:31.579> holes<00:03:31.819> with<00:03:32.150> this

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
bunch of different size holes with this

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.259 
bunch of different size holes with this
one<00:03:32.889> now<00:03:33.889> first<00:03:34.489> thing<00:03:34.639> you<00:03:34.729> want<00:03:34.909> to<00:03:34.939> do<00:03:35.060> with

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
one now first thing you want to do with

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.080 
one now first thing you want to do with
these<00:03:35.509> is<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.769> actual<00:03:36.919> body<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.759> the<00:03:37.879> bit

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
these is in the actual body of the bit

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.909 
these is in the actual body of the bit
you're<00:03:38.629> going<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.840> work<00:03:39.259> it<00:03:39.409> just<00:03:39.439> like<00:03:39.799> an

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
you're going to work it just like an

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.499 
you're going to work it just like an
auger<00:03:40.069> bit<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.519> got<00:03:40.669> that<00:03:40.849> cutter<00:03:41.180> there

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:41.509 
auger bit it's got that cutter there

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.839 
auger bit it's got that cutter there
just<00:03:41.959> like<00:03:42.139> they<00:03:42.290> are<00:03:42.409> a<00:03:42.439> bit<00:03:42.709> turn<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.579> out<00:03:43.699> and

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
just like they are a bit turn it out and

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.089 
just like they are a bit turn it out and
I<00:03:43.879> go<00:03:44.090> they're<00:03:44.239> on<00:03:44.359> their<00:03:44.599> block<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.959> wood<00:03:45.109> and

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
I go they're on their block of wood and

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.619 
I go they're on their block of wood and
then<00:03:46.400> use<00:03:46.549> your<00:03:46.699> file<00:03:46.879> and<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.329> go<00:03:47.449> right

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
then use your file and just go right

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.530 
then use your file and just go right
across<00:03:47.750> there<00:03:48.199> and<00:03:48.590> file<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.519> nice<00:03:50.299> and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
across there and file that nice and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.119 
across there and file that nice and
sharp<00:03:50.689> we<00:03:51.079> have<00:03:51.199> to<00:03:51.319> get<00:03:51.409> a<00:03:51.439> bar<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.859> can<00:03:51.949> knock

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
sharp we have to get a bar you can knock

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.890 
sharp we have to get a bar you can knock
it<00:03:52.159> out<00:03:52.340> for<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.609> belt<00:03:52.790> or<00:03:53.000> possibly<00:03:53.659> the<00:03:53.750> bow

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
it out for the belt or possibly the bow

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.390 
it out for the belt or possibly the bow
if<00:03:54.109> you're<00:03:54.259> very<00:03:54.560> very<00:03:54.680> careful<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.310> don't

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
if you're very very careful you don't

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.390 
if you're very very careful you don't
want<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.609> backpedal<00:03:56.139> on<00:03:57.139> this<00:03:57.889> cutter<00:03:58.129> wing

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
want to backpedal on this cutter wing

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.399 
want to backpedal on this cutter wing
it's<00:03:58.609> got<00:03:58.759> a<00:03:58.790> curve<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.449> it<00:03:59.479> makes<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.199> little

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
it's got a curve to it makes a little

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.709 
it's got a curve to it makes a little
hard<00:04:00.560> sharp<00:04:01.129> engine<00:04:01.489> from<00:04:01.669> the<00:04:01.759> top<00:04:01.969> so<00:04:02.689> I

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:02.719 
hard sharp engine from the top so I

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.240 
hard sharp engine from the top so I
figured<00:04:03.019> I'd<00:04:03.139> be<00:04:03.199> just<00:04:03.379> sharpen<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.889> bottom

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
figured I'd be just sharpen the bottom

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.879 
figured I'd be just sharpen the bottom
just<00:04:05.150> like<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.359> on<00:04:05.719> a<00:04:05.750> stone<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.500> usually<00:04:06.769> use

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
just like that on a stone I usually use

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.189 
just like that on a stone I usually use
a<00:04:06.919> water<00:04:07.159> stone<00:04:07.430> that's<00:04:07.729> from<00:04:07.909> just<00:04:08.180> here<00:04:08.419> and

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
a water stone that's from just here and

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.679 
a water stone that's from just here and
then<00:04:10.099> you<00:04:10.189> can<00:04:10.340> take<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.790> sharpen<00:04:11.329> the<00:04:11.419> inside

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
then you can take and sharpen the inside

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.449 
then you can take and sharpen the inside
edges<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.289> spur<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:13.009> like<00:04:13.129> you<00:04:13.310> would

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
edges of that spur just like you would

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.369 
edges of that spur just like you would
on<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.759> other<00:04:13.879> auger<00:04:14.209> bit<00:04:14.509> again<00:04:14.930> stay<00:04:15.229> away

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
on the other auger bit again stay away

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.529 
on the other auger bit again stay away
from<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.680> outside<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.280> spar<00:04:16.669> because<00:04:17.389> that

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
from the outside that spar because that

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.949 
from the outside that spar because that
will<00:04:17.659> mess<00:04:17.780> up<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.219> bit<00:04:19.219> but

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
will mess up the bit but

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.689 
will mess up the bit but
and<00:04:21.199> just<00:04:21.470> goes<00:04:21.650> right<00:04:21.949> back<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:22.370> there<00:04:22.550> and

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
and just goes right back in there and

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.189 
and just goes right back in there and
that's<00:04:23.060> pretty<00:04:23.570> much<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.050> risk

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
that's pretty much all the risk

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.190 
that's pretty much all the risk
sharpening<00:04:24.710> things
