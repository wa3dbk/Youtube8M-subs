00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.490 
it's pretty simple but you will need
that<00:01:47.939> silencing<00:01:48.479> shot<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> team<00:01:49.140> go

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that silencing shot to make the team go

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.490 
that silencing shot to make the team go
by<00:01:49.649> smoothly<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> exact<00:01:52.110> same<00:01:52.140> thing

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
by smoothly it's the exact same thing

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.550 
by smoothly it's the exact same thing
for<00:01:52.710> karke<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.990> easy<00:01:54.990> team<00:01:55.259> when<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.470> know

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
for karke and easy team when you know

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.370 
for karke and easy team when you know
what<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:55.799> doing<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:57.380> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
what you're doing and there you go now I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.910 
what you're doing and there you go now I
have<00:01:58.890> heard<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.310> another<00:01:59.610> method<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.600> uses

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
have heard of another method which uses

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
have heard of another method which uses
conveyance<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> winds<00:02:02.909> which<00:02:03.149> increases

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
conveyance of the winds which increases

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
conveyance of the winds which increases
your<00:02:03.719> attack<00:02:03.810> speed<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.439> haste<00:02:05.280> by<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> hundred

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
your attack speed and haste by a hundred

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.029 
your attack speed and haste by a hundred
percent<00:02:05.899> I<00:02:06.899> would<00:02:07.259> assume<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.890> would

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
percent I would assume that it would

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.699 
percent I would assume that it would
work<00:02:08.810> but

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
work but

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.699 
work but
the<00:02:11.159> silencing<00:02:11.939> shot<00:02:12.209> method<00:02:12.659> is<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> lot<00:02:13.500> safer

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the silencing shot method is a lot safer

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.559 
the silencing shot method is a lot safer
cuz<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.069> haven't<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:14.519> seen<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.939> done<00:02:15.269> in

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
cuz I haven't actually seen this done in

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.960 
cuz I haven't actually seen this done in
action<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.349> it's<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.620> worth<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.950> lose<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
action and it's not worth it to lose the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.670 
action and it's not worth it to lose the
rare<00:02:18.120> spawn<00:02:18.360> obviously<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.079> if<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.409> want<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
rare spawn obviously but if you want to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.520 
rare spawn obviously but if you want to
give<00:02:19.799> this<00:02:20.040> method<00:02:20.849> ago<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.780> use<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.500> of
