00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
but this time of the year it's difficult

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.879 
but this time of the year it's difficult
to<00:00:08.910> get<00:00:09.030> out<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.420> do<00:00:09.570> much<00:00:09.840> work<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.710> so

good<00:00:14.070> time<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.240> find<00:00:15.540> out<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> little

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
good time for is to find out a little

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.290 
good time for is to find out a little
bit<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.949> soil<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.369> your<00:00:17.400> garden<00:00:17.580> it's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
bit about the soil in your garden it's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000 
bit about the soil in your garden it's
the<00:00:18.449> most<00:00:18.630> important<00:00:19.230> thing<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.650> plants

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the most important thing the plants

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.279 
the most important thing the plants
growing<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.730> need<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.960> type

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
growing it so you need to know what type

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.529 
growing it so you need to know what type
of<00:00:22.320> sword<00:00:22.800> you've<00:00:23.279> got<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
of sword you've got and there are a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.390 
of sword you've got and there are a
couple<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.140> simple<00:00:25.650> tests<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.220> can

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
couple of very simple tests that you can

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
couple of very simple tests that you can
do<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.730> will<00:00:26.880> cost<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.539> money<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
do that will cost very little money that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.169 
do that will cost very little money that
will<00:00:28.529> give<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> lot<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.310> information<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
will give you a lot of information and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.530 
will give you a lot of information and
make<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.510> easier<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.650> Fowler's<00:00:32.070> fruits

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
make it easier for going Fowler's fruits

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.049 
make it easier for going Fowler's fruits
vegetables<00:00:33.649> next<00:00:34.649> year<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.100> forever<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
vegetables next year and forever the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.810 
vegetables next year and forever the
first<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> pH<00:00:37.710> test<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
first one we can do is a pH test and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.090 
first one we can do is a pH test and
that<00:00:39.059> determines<00:00:39.840> whether<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.469> saw<00:00:40.770> is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
that determines whether your saw is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.299 
that determines whether your saw is
alkaline<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:41.940> acid<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.620> determined

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
alkaline or acid and it's all determined

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.639 
alkaline or acid and it's all determined
by<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.000> amount<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.450> calcium<00:00:45.719> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> line

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
by the amount of calcium which is line

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
by the amount of calcium which is line
that's<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.670> soil<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.539> you've<00:00:48.690> got

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that's in your soil so if you've got

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.049 
that's in your soil so if you've got
lots<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.320> line<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> saw<00:00:50.100> you've<00:00:50.610> got<00:00:50.850> an

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
lots of line in the saw you've got an

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
lots of line in the saw you've got an
alkaline<00:00:51.660> soil<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.829> you've<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.340> very

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
alkaline soil if you've not got very

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
alkaline soil if you've not got very
much<00:00:53.789> line<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.570> an<00:00:54.690> acid<00:00:55.050> song<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
much line then it's an acid song in the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.369 
much line then it's an acid song in the
middle<00:00:56.070> half<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.300> call<00:00:57.570> neutral<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
middle half way we call neutral and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
middle half way we call neutral and
that's<00:00:58.620> quite<00:00:58.920> important<00:00:59.579> because<00:00:59.730> sometimes

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that's quite important because sometimes

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.709 
that's quite important because sometimes
need<00:01:00.930> athletes<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.370> example

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
need athletes or for example

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.579 
need athletes or for example
rhododendrons<00:01:03.719> they've<00:01:03.989> got<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
rhododendrons they've got to have a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.190 
rhododendrons they've got to have a
nursing<00:01:05.070> saw<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.820> grow<00:01:06.000> wow<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.990> well

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
nursing saw to grow wow so it's well

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
nursing saw to grow wow so it's well
worth<00:01:07.439> carrying<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.400> simple<00:01:08.939> test

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
worth carrying out a very simple test

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.380 
worth carrying out a very simple test
you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.439> soil<00:01:10.860> pH<00:01:11.340> test<00:01:11.820> kit<00:01:12.119> like

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you can get it a soil pH test kit like

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
you can get it a soil pH test kit like
this<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.409> over<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.890> pound<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.640> worth

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this for just over a pound so it's worth

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
this for just over a pound so it's worth
spending<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.600> pound<00:01:15.869> before<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
spending a pound before you go out and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.670 
spending a pound before you go out and
spend<00:01:17.400> 20-30<00:01:18.180> pounds<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:19.110> dangerous<00:01:19.650> for

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
spend 20-30 pounds on very dangerous for

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
spend 20-30 pounds on very dangerous for
the<00:01:19.979> guard<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the guard and all you get with it is a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.700 
the guard and all you get with it is a
test<00:01:23.159> tube<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> color<00:01:24.930> chart<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.530> we

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
test tube and the color chart which we

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.859 
test tube and the color chart which we
need<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> keep<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> test<00:01:27.750> tube

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
need to keep and in the test tube

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.330 
need to keep and in the test tube
there's<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.579> container<00:01:30.420> full<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
there's a little container full of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
there's a little container full of
powder<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> determine

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
powder and this is going to determine

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.190 
powder and this is going to determine
what<00:01:34.770> r<00:01:34.950> ph<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.840> put<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
what r ph is so what we do is we put the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
what r ph is so what we do is we put the
powder<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.490> test<00:01:38.909> tube<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:40.759> then<00:01:41.759> we

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
powder into the test tube and then we

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.200 
powder into the test tube and then we
need<00:01:42.180> some<00:01:42.420> dry<00:01:42.689> soil<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.829> ideally<00:01:44.280> need<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
need some dry soil so ideally need to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.850 
need some dry soil so ideally need to
get<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> salt<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> GAR<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
get a bit of salt out of the GAR and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.240 
get a bit of salt out of the GAR and
just<00:01:47.700> dry<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.180> house<00:01:48.450> for

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
just dry it in the house for

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.010 
just dry it in the house for
they're<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:49.820> on<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.150> piece<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.420> kitchen<00:01:50.660> roll

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
they're so on a piece of kitchen roll

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.130 
they're so on a piece of kitchen roll
and<00:01:51.290> then<00:01:51.920> push<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.670> powers<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.360> we<00:01:53.660> want<00:01:53.870> a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
and then push the powers in we want a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.400 
and then push the powers in we want a
little<00:01:54.290> bit<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.530> our<00:01:54.740> July<00:01:55.160> soil<00:01:56.020> but<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.170> there

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
little bit of our July soil but in there

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.700 
little bit of our July soil but in there
we<00:01:57.890> go<00:01:58.040> up<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.400> first<00:01:58.700> indicator<00:01:59.450> over<00:02:00.440> to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
we go up to the first indicator over to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.340 
we go up to the first indicator over to
it's<00:02:01.160> quite<00:02:01.460> easy<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.940> do<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.930> takes<00:02:03.170> a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's quite easy to do that it takes a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.230 
it's quite easy to do that it takes a
couple<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.680> minutes<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.130> then<00:02:04.550> we<00:02:04.670> top<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:04.910> up

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
couple of minutes and then we top it up

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.750 
couple of minutes and then we top it up
with<00:02:05.290> ordinary<00:02:06.290> water<00:02:06.710> just<00:02:07.100> tap<00:02:07.280> water's

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
with ordinary water just tap water's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.430 
with ordinary water just tap water's
fine<00:02:08.000> or<00:02:08.300> if<00:02:08.360> you've<00:02:08.509> got<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.810> still<00:02:09.080> that's

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
fine or if you've got this still that's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.730 
fine or if you've got this still that's
better<00:02:09.860> still<00:02:10.340> put<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.060> cap<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.840> then

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
better still put the cap on and then

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.650 
better still put the cap on and then
we're<00:02:13.220> going<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.430> give<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:14.120> good<00:02:14.330> shelter

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
we're going to give that a good shelter

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.690 
we're going to give that a good shelter
but<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> indicator<00:02:15.590> pounder<00:02:16.130> you've<00:02:16.490> got<00:02:16.670> a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
but the indicator pounder you've got a

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.699 
but the indicator pounder you've got a
sword<00:02:17.060> or<00:02:17.270> got<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.630> water<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.440> then<00:02:18.560> we're

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
sword or got the water and then we're

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.740 
sword or got the water and then we're
going<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.890> give<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.310> good<00:02:19.550> shape<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.540> mix

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
going to give that a good shape to mix

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.380 
going to give that a good shape to mix
all<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.170> those<00:02:21.440> ingredients<00:02:21.950> together<00:02:22.400> takes

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
all of those ingredients together takes

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.210 
all of those ingredients together takes
a<00:02:23.510> couple<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.780> minutes<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.230> settle<00:02:24.470> also<00:02:25.130> we've

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
a couple of minutes to settle also we've

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.830 
a couple of minutes to settle also we've
given<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.580> shame<00:02:25.850> if<00:02:26.239> we<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.570> put<00:02:26.810> that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
given it a shame if we just put that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.250 
given it a shame if we just put that
there<00:02:27.370> for<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.850> time<00:02:29.120> being<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.810> let<00:02:30.110> that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
there for the time being and let that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.740 
there for the time being and let that
settle<00:02:30.620> if<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:31.670> look<00:02:31.820> at<00:02:31.970> another<00:02:32.239> simple

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
settle if you look at another simple

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.000 
settle if you look at another simple
test<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.290> do<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:33.680> one<00:02:33.890> is

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
test you can do and this one is

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.060 
test you can do and this one is
absolutely<00:02:34.610> free<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.050> actually<00:02:36.410> feel

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
absolutely free it's to actually feel

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.160 
absolutely free it's to actually feel
useful<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.880> get<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.540> texture<00:02:39.140> of

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
useful and get to know the texture of

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140 
useful and get to know the texture of
the<00:02:39.380> soil<00:02:39.650> because<00:02:40.160> from<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.400> we<00:02:40.970> can

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
the soil because from that we can

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.090 
the soil because from that we can
determine<00:02:41.510> whether<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.200> title<00:02:42.800> or<00:02:43.040> a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
determine whether it's a title or a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.420 
determine whether it's a title or a
sound<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.150> I've<00:02:44.660> got<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.900> spay<00:02:45.709> falls<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.190> saw

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
sound so I've got to spay falls of saw

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.400 
sound so I've got to spay falls of saw
here<00:02:46.670> both<00:02:46.910> out<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.209> my<00:02:47.570> garden<00:02:47.900> book<00:02:48.230> from

here both out of my garden book from

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.470 
here both out of my garden book from
different<00:02:48.860> parts<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.340> gun<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.270> just

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
different parts of the gun and that just

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.750 
different parts of the gun and that just
shows<00:02:50.540> how<00:02:50.690> much<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.350> song<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.860> vary<00:02:52.130> even<00:02:52.489> in

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
shows how much the song can vary even in

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.550 
shows how much the song can vary even in
a<00:02:52.820> gun<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.750> one<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.440> my<00:02:54.709> vegetable<00:02:55.310> plot<00:02:55.580> and

into<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.489> shade<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.630> breaks<00:03:03.049> up<00:03:03.260> very<00:03:03.530> easily

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
into a shade it breaks up very easily

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.920 
into a shade it breaks up very easily
and<00:03:04.250> if<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.580> rub<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.940> between<00:03:05.090> my<00:03:05.390> finger<00:03:05.780> and

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
thumb I can feel a little bit of sand or

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.060 
thumb I can feel a little bit of sand or
grit<00:03:08.450> anees<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.170> there<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.739> claiming

there<00:03:10.430> because<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.940> makes<00:03:11.120> them<00:03:11.330> all<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:11.989> it's

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
there because it makes them all but it's

also<00:03:12.320> not<00:03:12.739> standing<00:03:13.370> still<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.510> would<00:03:14.690> call

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
also not standing still so we would call

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.289 
also not standing still so we would call
that<00:03:14.959> a<00:03:15.350> lonely<00:03:15.739> saw<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.190> quite<00:03:16.459> friable<00:03:17.150> it

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
that a lonely saw it's quite friable it

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.289 
that a lonely saw it's quite friable it
breaks<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.870> easily<00:03:18.160> whereas<00:03:19.160> this<00:03:19.400> one<00:03:19.459> this

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
breaks up easily whereas this one this

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.660 
breaks up easily whereas this one this
is<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> different<00:03:21.049> type<00:03:21.320> of<00:03:21.350> saw<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.459> from

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
is a different type of saw this is from

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.860 
is a different type of saw this is from
my<00:03:23.030> rose<00:03:23.299> garden<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.980> one<00:03:25.299> rolls<00:03:26.299> into<00:03:26.690> a

my rose garden and this one rolls into a
shape<00:03:27.340> really<00:03:28.340> easily<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.769> can't<00:03:31.010> break

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
shape really easily but you can't break

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.100 
shape really easily but you can't break
it<00:03:31.400> up<00:03:31.610> he<00:03:31.820> doesn't<00:03:32.180> crumble<00:03:32.390> at<00:03:32.630> all<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.959> has

result of water drains going much slower
and<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:38.540> one<00:03:38.750> that's<00:03:38.959> nice<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.440> friable<00:03:39.769> so

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
and this one that's nice and friable so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.300 
and this one that's nice and friable so
again<00:03:40.640> we<00:03:41.150> can<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:42.049> helps<00:03:42.380> work<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.070> soil

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
again we can it helps work in the soil

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.650 
again we can it helps work in the soil
of<00:03:43.459> times<00:03:43.700> where<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:43.940> get<00:03:44.209> them<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:44.450> lots

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
of times where you get them you lots

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.340 
of times where you get them you lots
more

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
more

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.110 
more
too<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:45.650> we<00:03:45.770> can<00:03:45.920> see<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.490> could<00:03:47.030> be

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
too but we can see that that could be

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.970 
too but we can see that that could be
used<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.510> make<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> cotton<00:03:48.230> sort<00:03:48.500> if<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:48.800> want

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
used to make a cotton sort if you want

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.400 
used to make a cotton sort if you want
to<00:03:49.130> do<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.760> that's<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.030> played<00:03:50.300> soil<00:03:50.660> now<00:03:51.350> if

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
to do so that's the played soil now if

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.060 
to do so that's the played soil now if
we<00:03:51.530> go<00:03:51.560> back<00:03:51.710> to<00:03:52.250> our<00:03:53.020> ph<00:03:54.020> temperatures<00:03:54.770> start

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
we go back to our ph temperatures start

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.700 
we go back to our ph temperatures start
to<00:03:55.160> settle<00:03:55.640> with<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.690> kit<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.320> get<00:03:57.530> this

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
to settle with the kit you get this

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.860 
to settle with the kit you get this
color<00:03:58.250> chart<00:03:58.610> which<00:03:58.850> is<00:03:59.030> very<00:03:59.240> important

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
color chart which is very important

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.520 
color chart which is very important
because<00:04:00.530> what<00:04:00.920> happens<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.430> as<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:03.350> liquid

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
because what happens is as the liquid

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.910 
because what happens is as the liquid
settles<00:04:04.430> in<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.640> sediment<00:04:05.330> settles<00:04:05.590> we<00:04:06.590> can

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
settles in the sediment settles we can

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.460 
settles in the sediment settles we can
read<00:04:07.550> off<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.970> color<00:04:08.210> against<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.260> color

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
read off the color against the color

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.490 
read off the color against the color
chart<00:04:09.860> and<00:04:10.550> I've<00:04:10.700> got<00:04:11.000> an<00:04:11.210> olive<00:04:11.630> green<00:04:11.960> that

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
chart and I've got an olive green that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.640 
chart and I've got an olive green that
tells<00:04:12.800> me<00:04:12.980> that<00:04:13.100> my<00:04:13.430> soil<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:14.510> about<00:04:14.900> neutral

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
tells me that my soil is about neutral

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.490 
tells me that my soil is about neutral
which<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.370> good<00:04:16.880> from<00:04:17.120> those<00:04:17.330> things<00:04:17.720> wouldn't

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
which is good from those things wouldn't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.320 
which is good from those things wouldn't
be<00:04:18.560> very<00:04:18.710> good<00:04:18.860> for<00:04:19.160> attendees<00:04:19.790> but<00:04:20.030> pretty

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
be very good for attendees but pretty

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.910 
be very good for attendees but pretty
much<00:04:20.420> anything<00:04:20.780> else<00:04:21.020> our<00:04:21.290> complaint<00:04:21.739> in

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
much anything else our complaint in

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.890 
much anything else our complaint in
there<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.610> I'll<00:04:22.760> know<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.240> will<00:04:23.390> go<00:04:23.540> really

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
there and I'll know it will go really

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.230 
there and I'll know it will go really
well
