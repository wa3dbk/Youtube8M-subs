up for the a clerk all right we're going

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.520 
up for the a clerk all right we're going
to<00:00:52.899> do<00:00:53.140> eight<00:00:54.100> strums<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:54.809> H<00:00:55.809> strums<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.379> E

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
to do eight strums of a H strums of E

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.490 
to do eight strums of a H strums of E
and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.879> we'll<00:00:58.059> loop<00:00:58.210> it<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.539> you<00:00:59.110> get<00:00:59.289> plenty

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
and then we'll loop it so you get plenty

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.520 
and then we'll loop it so you get plenty

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.550 
so go ahead and loop that and then let's
also<00:01:40.620> practice<00:01:41.340> doing<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.730> down<00:01:42.330> up<00:01:42.810> okay<00:01:43.500> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
also practice doing this down up okay so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920 
also practice doing this down up okay so
instead<00:01:44.160> of<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.970> straight<00:01:45.240> down<00:01:45.270> strums

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
instead of just straight down strums

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.230 
instead of just straight down strums
counting<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.530> two<00:01:46.560> three<00:01:47.310> four<00:01:47.640> we're<00:01:48.090> going

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
counting one two three four we're going

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.220 
counting one two three four we're going
to<00:01:48.300> do<00:01:48.480> alternate<00:01:49.230> strums<00:01:49.530> down<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.880> down<00:01:51.870> up

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
to do alternate strums down up down up

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.670 
to do alternate strums down up down up
and<00:01:52.800> I'm<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> count<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.320> two<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and I'm going to count one and two and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
and I'm going to count one and two and
three<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.060> okay

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
three and okay

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.160 
three and okay
so<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.580> numbers<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.180> strum<00:02:00.420> down<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.900> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
so on the numbers we strum down on the

so on the numbers we strum down on the
ands<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.920> strum<00:02:02.250> up<00:02:02.660> let's<00:02:03.660> try<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.380> we

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
ands we strum up let's try that here we

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.820 
ands we strum up let's try that here we
go

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
go

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.199
