00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.740

to<00:03:07.840> disappear<00:03:08.530> with<00:03:08.709> this<00:03:08.860> one<00:03:09.370> here<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.790> have

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
to disappear with this one here I have

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.960 
to disappear with this one here I have
some<00:03:10.480> pickups<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.770> sounds<00:03:12.040> very<00:03:12.250> very<00:03:12.400> nice<00:03:12.760> I

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
some pickups it sounds very very nice I

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.760 
some pickups it sounds very very nice I
think

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
think

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.960 
think
so<00:03:14.770> again<00:03:15.069> this<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.489> going<00:03:16.090> from<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
so again this is going from the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.510 
so again this is going from the
Epiphone<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:20.080> boss<00:03:20.770> overdrive<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.430> the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
Epiphone to the boss overdrive to the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.150 
Epiphone to the boss overdrive to the
sd1<00:03:21.850> go<00:03:22.270> into<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.720> car<00:03:22.989> only<00:03:23.830> using<00:03:24.100> the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
sd1 go into the car only using the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.729 
sd1 go into the car only using the
modulated<00:03:24.730> delay<00:03:25.080> going<00:03:26.080> into<00:03:26.440> the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
modulated delay going into the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.800 
modulated delay going into the
repercussion<00:03:27.519> switch<00:03:27.880> off<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.239> moment<00:03:28.480> and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
repercussion switch off the moment and

00:03:28.810 --> 00:05:32.980 
repercussion switch off the moment and
I'm<00:03:28.959> going<00:03:28.989> from<00:03:29.380> there

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.780 

what<00:05:33.990> problem<00:05:34.350> with<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.620> radar<00:05:35.130> question<00:05:35.520> is

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
what problem with the radar question is

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.080 
what problem with the radar question is
I<00:05:36.210> think<00:05:38.030> it's<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.330> noise<00:05:39.510> it's

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
I think it's that the noise it's

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.330 
I think it's that the noise it's
community<00:05:42.090> end<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:44.540> the<00:05:45.890> barrier<00:05:46.890> from<00:05:47.220> the

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
community end of the barrier from the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.040 
community end of the barrier from the
train<00:05:48.170> noise<00:05:49.170> will<00:05:49.500> be<00:05:49.530> a<00:05:49.980> lot<00:05:50.490> more<00:05:50.900> from<00:05:51.900> the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
train noise will be a lot more from the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.570 
train noise will be a lot more from the
end<00:05:52.200> so<00:05:52.950> I<00:05:52.980> think<00:05:53.160> that's<00:05:55.070> what<00:05:56.070> makes<00:05:56.250> so<00:05:56.490> much

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
end so I think that's what makes so much

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.300 
end so I think that's what makes so much
value<00:05:59.810> for<00:06:00.810> recording<00:06:01.500> what<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:01.860> do<00:06:02.070> is

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
value for recording what I do is

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.730 
value for recording what I do is
actually<00:06:02.970> use<00:06:03.270> this<00:06:03.450> as<00:06:03.750> an<00:06:03.990> external<00:06:05.810> sorry

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
actually use this as an external sorry

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.100 
actually use this as an external sorry
so<00:06:08.640> just<00:06:09.180> put<00:06:10.050> them<00:06:10.260> into<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:11.370> mix<00:06:11.760> them

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
so just put them into the to mix them

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.170 
so just put them into the to mix them
and<00:06:13.110> that's<00:06:13.380> working<00:06:13.860> fine<00:06:14.130> which<00:06:14.910> you<00:06:15.030> can

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
and that's working fine which you can

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.760 
and that's working fine which you can
see<00:06:15.360> on<00:06:15.480> another<00:06:15.750> video<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.200> previous<00:06:16.590> one

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
see on another video the previous one

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:26.300 
see on another video the previous one
now<00:06:22.160> let's<00:06:23.160> do<00:06:23.580> I<00:06:23.880> did<00:06:24.810> why<00:06:25.440> for<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.710> millisecond

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
now let's do I did why for a millisecond

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.410 
now let's do I did why for a millisecond
step<00:06:26.490> on

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:07:58.700 

-<00:06:32.170> 4:20

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.070 

thank<00:07:59.710> you<00:07:59.800> for<00:07:59.950> listening
