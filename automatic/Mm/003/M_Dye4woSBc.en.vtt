00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.919
 hello I hope you are very well I am 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.119
 grammy and today I prepared them a video in the 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.310
 that we are going to recycle bottles of 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.779
 plastic and cans so as soon as you see 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.550
 a can or a plastic bottle 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.869
 save it because these are so 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.769
 incredible I know you will like them 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.970
 very much and I'm going to show you how 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.830
 for this first idea we are going to choose 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.839
 plastic bottles the size and design 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.210
 you want to cut them to the 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.650
 height that you want with a cutter or with 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.910
 Scissors with what you do more 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.980
 easy 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.500
 then you are going to take the clothes iron 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 if you iron the clothes and you're going to paste the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.640
 grilled bottles with care of no 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.140
 burn you this is going to make the plastic 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.620
 it can not burn you and it melts and you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.620
 make pretty 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.749
 Y 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.699
 what follows is to take a big brush 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 recited the color white and glitter 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.240
 what you want 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.180
 then you begin to mix everything inside 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.190
 from the bottle and let it fill up 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.340
 well spreads the all good well good well 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.340
 all right 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 I made one blue and one of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.120
 orange color let it dry as 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 for six hours and it was amazing and now 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.820
 you have a container to store what 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.820
 you want 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.210
 for this second age we are going to use 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.909
 cans already know t for example I know tea 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.890
 or it can be soda the size that 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.110
 you want and with a cutter or some 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.110
 scissors you're going to cut from above 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.549
 and of course scissors 2 was matching 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.740
 all my good can all the part of 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.290
 on top of my can and I know exactly what 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.150
 same with my other can cut and in 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.520
 parsley 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.590
 to one of the cans cut it online 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.649
 to be able to bend the tin a little and 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.880
 can put it inside the other can 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.880
 be very careful not to break them 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.799
 now it's never out of the can cut out a 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.889
 line and push in with your 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.810
 fingers that do not go to cut 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:30.389
 You can also decorate your can like you 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.730
 I want to decorate the paste paper 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:35.749
 and you masking of colors so that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.749
 I saw even more father 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.330
 with a black marker I started to design 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.030
 the can as I wanted it I made him lines 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.060
 little zig zag triangles I made him 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.060
 all 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.350
 now look where you had the cut and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.570
 help you from a cutter to trim the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.850
 paper and with your fingers you are going to push a 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.760
 little in 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.180
 and ready now you have a piggybank 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.180
 new 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.300
 this other piggy bank is very different 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.520
 I chose these tiny cans and did what 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.590
 same as I did to the other cans of 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.140
 the other piggy but on the part of 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.540
 decoration use varnishes is a container 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.220
 with water and varnishes that you want 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.620
 after throwing a few drops at 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.239
 container and with a stick mixes all 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.239
 the colors and dip this piggy 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.550
 or not 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.379
 with 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.750
 two 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.299
 and you already have two new city halls 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.260
 for this idea we need a bottle 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.200
 of plastic some sticks of wood and 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.080
 some kitchen spoons and also food 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.200
 for birds with a knife I made some holes 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.730
 to be able to cross the sticks also 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.280
 I did it at the top of the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.280
 bottle in the middle part and below 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.289
 after putting the clubs the shovels and 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.870
 the spoons and everything you wanted 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.340
 put it fill with birdseed but cover a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.590
 little eyes so it does not come out 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.169
 then to the top he made a hole for 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.160
 can put a bit of rope and power 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.110
 hold it up 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.870
 I knotted it under the lid 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.580
 and now ready to do the sat and they will see 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.580
 more happy birds in the world 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.790
 These ideas are very important because 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.030
 we convert something that we are not going to use 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.400
 in something that is going to use something very beautiful 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.010
 something with your creativity of imagination and 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.360
 they are very parents then I hope 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.520
 what do you guys like, too? 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.680
 these ideas I hope you are encouraged to do 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.270
 one of these things and if you 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.310
 you encourage to do it you know that you can 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.730
