00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello everyone welcome to the tutorial 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.690
 of the eleventh magic trick with le 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.870
 cards go and see reduce 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.820
 twelfth otherwise you will not understand well 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 what I say these out of tune and video e 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.170
 this is the simple bunch tutorial 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.330
 normal cards we promise we have a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.420
 collaborator to perform this trick 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.780
 nice let's choose a card a 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:38.809
 If this thing chooses a case card 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 choice we start to mix the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:48.110
 let's put the card in the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 deck and let us say stop first 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 insert the card into the deck 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.820
 we put a card in the game yes and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.230
 we continue to shuffle the cards over 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 there is still a card below 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:09.840
 we finish mixing this card 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.299
 at the end of my journey there is the card 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.710
 chosen by the viewer so you are 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.850
 so you don't see paper up behind 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 from cards behind with the thumb is done 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.590
 a fairy so now I'll show you 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.619
 we are like that from your frame 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.659
 take your thumb and do the other 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.020
 this deck here will be the card of the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020
 viewer 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.009
 now let 's tell the viewer to tell us a 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.750
 number from 152 12 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.700
 we take the card and we do reverse 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.100
 the order of the cards we take the first 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 than that of the spectator and we admit 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.509
 here 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.270
 so now when we go to recount 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.750
 the reversing the twelfth order 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.750
 paper 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.350
 12 alone that of the spectator 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.840
