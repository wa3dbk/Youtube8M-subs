00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.730
 but it is after the Adriatic Tyrrhenian Wednesday 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.240
 with nelly we went to see the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.210
 route of the gabicce chronometer 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.310
 jumping we saw a path of one 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.519
 very technical chronometer very difficult 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 therefore it will be necessary to see also in the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.619
 wheel choices some special features 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.070
 of the bike to try to do this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.020
 stopwatch in the best possible way is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 a very long crono of the one speaks the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:49.190
 looks for 55 56 km with several tears 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.190
 go up like this and also lots of curves 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.200
 I did it coming all the way 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.370
 always coming back to Milan we will be believe 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.040
 that here we have the best team of 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.440
 moment all the best runners that 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.070
 they showed something really 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.930
 good and that are in great condition 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.510
 we are here to play our best 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.900
 so we are a team a lot 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.920
 complete because there are me in grease 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.590
 whoever aspires them 8 inches then barrel 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.509
 we think I am one of the best 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.750
 teams at the start of this milan 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.710
 sanremo the circle doing more item 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.510
 accident they are from the hand they go to 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.960
 administrators 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:53.440
 I go when then but the sanremo is 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.700
 a very difficult thing I have already run 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.140
 but many other times really 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.750
 difficult to interpret because a 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.390
 path with tears with lines 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.090
 climbs that are done at great speed 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.870
 therefore it is difficult to find a way to 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.400
 to be able to make a nation 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.230
 the only thing and try to make the climbs 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.020
 like your hands a little strong to try to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.630
 have a bit more maybe in the end 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.860
 the time I would like 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.360
 However, he admitted, but I hope that bad weather 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.070
 don't be too cold because too much 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.970
 I don't think it's good 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.130
 the weather says around 23 degrees and snow 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.250
 let's hope not just maybe some 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.250
 rain for me is not a problem okay
