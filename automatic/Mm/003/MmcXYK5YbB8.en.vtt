00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.410
 in this video we are going to see how we can 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.540
 delete junk files after 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.610
 uninstall a program usually 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.800
 when you install a program from 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.080
 the control panel are left folders 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.060
 files next to registry keys in 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.070
 the system to delete the files 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.289
 garbage or leftovers from a program is 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.449
 necessary to use a tool 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.159
 forced uninstallation in this type of 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.679
 tools what it does is find in 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.230
 the unwanted files and then what 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.989
 does is erase them after the process of 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.970
 uninstall for this case I want them 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.850
 recommend a program that I've already talked about 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.220
 in previous videos and it's called windows 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.650
 installer is a program that allows us 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.200
 remove applications and also 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.300
 add-ons for our browser 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.970
 works for both windows vista 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 windows 7 and windows 8 and in the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.200
 description of the video I will leave you the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.900
 link so they can download it 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.329
 simply by entering the pc blog 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.150
 dotcom webs are going to click on the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.970
 link that says 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.010
 and yÃºnes such was automatically after 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.460
 will take them to google drive where they can 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.800
 cross in the file menu and download or 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.440
 you can simply cross in the button 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.300
 to download 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.000
 we hope that the process of 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.470
 download and we continue with the process of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.470
 program execution 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.079
 we're just going to run the program 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.060
 and automatically it starts up is not 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.250
 necessary to install is a program 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.729
 fully portable we press where it says 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.219
 run now and automatically we are 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.140
 will change to Spanish we have two large 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.539
 tabs the first tab is the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.759
 programs tab in it we 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.859
 we find some sections in the 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.539
 which we are going to see that we are 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.819
 with all that is to say all the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.709
 applications that we have installed in 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.599
 our computer the recent 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.270
 those that we have recently 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.299
 installed those that are occupying 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.369
 too much space on our computer 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.289
 and those little used for those that do not 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.509
 we use generally and that too 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.700
 we could uninstall them and finally 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.860
 we have windows updates that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.410
 they each come with a name 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.150
 which if for example in some of those 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.060
 updates for example this 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.099
 2003 advertising in the use can 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.500
 generally uninstall it without any 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.569
 kind of problem and we are in the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.970
 another tab the toolbar and 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.560
 add-ons for both firefox internet 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.270
 explorer and of course 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.310
 google chrome here can also 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.010
 uninstall all those exceptions and 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.110
 plugins they have in the browser 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.909
 let's see then an example 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.099
 uninstalling several programs I'm going to 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.870
 uninstall the noten that is to say I'm going to 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.790
 select several programs at once 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.790
 I'm going to select them 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.410
 and then we will press the button 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.780
 uninstall 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.850
 here he asks us what we have that is 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.500
 necessary or it is advisable to create a 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.960
 restoration point in case 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.780
 have errors we selected it and 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.220
 click on uninstall automatically 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.500
 you start to create the point of 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.050
 restoration and we wait a moment and 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 After that, the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.500
 attendees of each of the programs 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.210
 that we have selected to be 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.790
 can uninstall 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.850
 let's follow all the steps of that 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.860
 installation 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.860
 in the next next and final 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.379
 end one and continue with the other 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.180
 automatically and finally we have the 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.430
 powerful scan is the manager 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.019
 then to clean the files 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.510
 leftovers we simply give in 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.129
 scan of mighty and it will show us 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.340
 a list of folders and files 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.019
 left over from these programs that we have 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.209
 uninstalled we just select 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.659
