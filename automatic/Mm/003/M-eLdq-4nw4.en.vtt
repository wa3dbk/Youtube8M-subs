00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
get more tired which is rare a lot of my

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.650 
get more tired which is rare a lot of my
clients<00:05:58.600> go<00:05:59.020> through<00:05:59.610> opposite<00:06:00.610> where<00:06:01.540> they

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
clients go through opposite where they

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.240 
clients go through opposite where they
have<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.840> lot<00:06:02.050> more<00:06:02.140> energy<00:06:02.350> but<00:06:02.650> for<00:06:03.100> some

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
have a lot more energy but for some

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.110 
have a lot more energy but for some
reason<00:06:03.630> my<00:06:04.630> energy<00:06:04.930> goes<00:06:05.080> down<00:06:05.320> a<00:06:05.350> little<00:06:05.650> bit

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
reason my energy goes down a little bit
