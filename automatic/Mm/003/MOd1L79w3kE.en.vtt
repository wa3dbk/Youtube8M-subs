drop<00:00:02.760> strings<00:00:03.120> are<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> very<00:00:03.540> simple<00:00:04.049> and

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
drop strings are a very simple and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.309 
drop strings are a very simple and
elegant<00:00:04.410> technique<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.430> know<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:06.540> does<00:00:06.899> take<00:00:06.930> a

elegant technique to know it does take a

little bit of time it is not something

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.570

that<00:00:09.809> most<00:00:10.260> people<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.769> accomplish<00:00:11.040> if

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
that most people can accomplish if

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.759 
that most people can accomplish if
they're<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.000> hurry<00:00:12.269> but<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.500> well<00:00:13.740> worth

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
they're in a hurry but it's well worth

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.670 
they're in a hurry but it's well worth
the<00:00:14.130> patience<00:00:14.639> because<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.599> usually<00:00:15.960> produces

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the patience because it usually produces

the patience because it usually produces
a<00:00:16.710> very<00:00:17.039> pretty<00:00:17.400> effect<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.539> make<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> simple

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
a very pretty effect to make a simple

a very pretty effect to make a simple
drop<00:00:19.529> string<00:00:19.920> you're<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.430> start<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:20.939> by

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
drop string you're going to start out by

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
drop string you're going to start out by
touching<00:00:21.600> your<00:00:21.930> tip<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> surface<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
touching your tip to the surface and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.790 
touching your tip to the surface and
then<00:00:23.760> continue<00:00:24.390> squeezing<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> bag<00:00:25.500> as

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
then continue squeezing on the bag as

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.790 
then continue squeezing on the bag as
you<00:00:26.070> pull<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.550> tip<00:00:27.000> away<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.869> towards<00:00:28.439> you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
you pull the tip away and towards you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.240 
you pull the tip away and towards you
then<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:30.029> gauge<00:00:30.390> how<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.199> icing<00:00:32.009> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
then you can gauge how much icing is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
then you can gauge how much icing is
coming<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> bag<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:34.140> will

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
coming out of the bag and that will

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740 
coming out of the bag and that will
determine<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.070> length<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:35.940> drop<00:00:36.390> string

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
determine the length of your drop string

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.979 
determine the length of your drop string
and<00:00:37.020> once<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.250> string<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.270> size<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.750> want

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and once the string is the size you want

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
and once the string is the size you want
it<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.860> touch<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.340> tip<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it you just touch the tip back to the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
it you just touch the tip back to the
surface<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.870> attach<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.500> string<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
surface to attach the string on the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.700 
surface to attach the string on the
other<00:00:44.309> side<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.780> working<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.320> some

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
other side here I'm working on some

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.180 
other side here I'm working on some
double<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.820> triple<00:00:48.239> drop<00:00:48.480> strings<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.170> find<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
double and triple drop strings I find it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.670 
double and triple drop strings I find it
easiest<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> longest<00:00:51.930> strings<00:00:52.289> first

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
easiest to do the longest strings first

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
easiest to do the longest strings first
and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.579> come<00:00:53.940> back<00:00:54.149> through<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> add<00:00:54.930> these

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and then come back through and add these

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.029 
and then come back through and add these
shorter<00:00:55.800> strings<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:57.199> common<00:00:58.199> challenge<00:00:58.710> when

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
shorter strings a common challenge when

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.979 
shorter strings a common challenge when
piping<00:00:59.609> drop<00:00:59.820> strings<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.359> sometimes<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
piping drop strings is sometimes the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.470 
piping drop strings is sometimes the
icing<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.920> break<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.850> find<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.239> that's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
icing will break if you find that that's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.420 
icing will break if you find that that's
happening<00:01:03.960> add<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.589> bit<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> piping<00:01:05.250> gel

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
happening add a little bit of piping gel

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.940 
happening add a little bit of piping gel
to<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.700> icing<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.380> help<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.740> come

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to your icing and that will help it come

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.640 
to your icing and that will help it come
out<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> tip<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.700> bit<00:01:08.850> more<00:01:09.060> smoothly

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.190 

once<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.640> feel<00:01:18.820> confident<00:01:19.300> piping<00:01:19.810> simple

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
once you feel confident piping simple

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.380 
once you feel confident piping simple
drop<00:01:20.470> strings<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:21.220> can<00:01:21.250> vary<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:22.000> technique

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
drop strings you can vary the technique

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.620 
drop strings you can vary the technique
here<00:01:23.140> we<00:01:23.440> have<00:01:23.670> overlapping<00:01:24.670> triple<00:01:25.360> drop

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
here we have overlapping triple drop

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
here we have overlapping triple drop
strings<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.440> this<00:01:27.430> produces<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.150> really<00:01:28.720> fancy

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
strings and this produces a really fancy

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.550 
strings and this produces a really fancy
elaborate<00:01:30.400> effect<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.870> great<00:01:32.230> as<00:01:32.500> a

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
elaborate effect it's great as a

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.400 
elaborate effect it's great as a
decoration<00:01:33.430> on<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.090> side<00:01:34.300> of<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.510> cake<00:01:34.690> I<00:01:34.900> am

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
decoration on the side of a cake I am

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.970 
decoration on the side of a cake I am
going<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:35.920> speed<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.370> video<00:01:36.520> up<00:01:36.730> because<00:01:37.600> I

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
going to speed the video up because I

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.110 
going to speed the video up because I
realized<00:01:38.980> that<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.370> is<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> technique<00:01:40.060> that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
realized that this is a technique that

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.250 
realized that this is a technique that
can't<00:01:40.570> be<00:01:40.660> rushed

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
can't be rushed

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.470 
can't be rushed
and<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:42.340> probably<00:01:42.580> don't<00:01:43.000> want<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.210> spend

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
and you probably don't want to spend

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.330 
and you probably don't want to spend
your<00:01:43.630> entire<00:01:43.780> life<00:01:43.990> watching<00:01:44.590> me<00:01:44.890> pipe<00:01:45.160> all

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
your entire life watching me pipe all

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.500 
your entire life watching me pipe all
these<00:01:45.520> drop<00:01:45.790> strings

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.000 

but<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.630> method<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.080> essentially<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.770> same

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
but the method is essentially the same

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.430 
but the method is essentially the same
as<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.760> triple<00:01:53.210> drop<00:01:53.450> strings<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
as the triple drop strings in the

as the triple drop strings in the
diagram<00:01:54.950> above<00:01:55.190> this<00:01:55.640> one<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.360> only

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
diagram above this one the only

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.140 
diagram above this one the only
difference<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.200> we're<00:01:57.440> going<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.590> overlap<00:01:58.460> the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
difference is we're going to overlap the

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:22.470 
difference is we're going to overlap the
panels<00:01:59.870> of<00:02:00.080> drop<00:02:00.380> strings

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.110 

once<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.650> my<00:02:23.680> strings<00:02:24.190> piped<00:02:24.550> I'm<00:02:24.819> going

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
once I have my strings piped I'm going

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.880 
once I have my strings piped I'm going
to<00:02:25.239> finish<00:02:25.390> them<00:02:25.750> off<00:02:25.989> with<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> simple

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
to finish them off with a simple

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.910 
to finish them off with a simple
fleur-de-lis<00:02:27.849> at<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.450> tops<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.590> just

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
fleur-de-lis at the tops this is just

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.059 
fleur-de-lis at the tops this is just
three<00:02:30.400> simple<00:02:30.819> shells<00:02:31.150> one<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:32.019> vertical<00:02:32.890> and

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
three simple shells one is vertical and

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.460 
three simple shells one is vertical and
then<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.819> have<00:02:34.000> two<00:02:34.239> more<00:02:34.269> coming<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:34.989> from

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
then you have two more coming in from

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.350 
then you have two more coming in from
each<00:02:35.709> side<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.489> then<00:02:36.970> you're<00:02:37.209> going<00:02:37.300> to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
each side and then you're going to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.660 
each side and then you're going to
finish<00:02:37.629> that<00:02:37.810> off<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> simple<00:02:38.739> dot<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.519> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
finish that off with a simple dot in the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.970 
finish that off with a simple dot in the
middle

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.520 

the<00:02:42.980> French<00:02:43.430> border<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> simple<00:02:44.870> variation

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
the French border is a simple variation

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.740 
the French border is a simple variation
on<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.860> triple<00:02:46.190> drop<00:02:46.400> string<00:02:46.790> as<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.510> see

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
on the triple drop string as you can see

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.120 
on the triple drop string as you can see
one<00:02:48.260> side<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:49.340> higher<00:02:50.030> than<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.660> other<00:02:50.690> and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
one side is higher than the other and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.340 
one side is higher than the other and
these<00:02:52.130> also<00:02:52.460> are<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.540> overlap<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
these also are going to overlap and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.430 
these also are going to overlap and
again<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.890> have<00:02:55.190> sped<00:02:55.550> up<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> video<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:57.170> in

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
again I have sped up the video just in

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.370 
again I have sped up the video just in
the<00:02:57.620> interest<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.460> saving<00:02:59.060> time<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.720> you<00:03:00.170> can

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
the interest of saving time and you can

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.470 
the interest of saving time and you can
see<00:03:00.620> how<00:03:00.800> slowly<00:03:01.160> I'm<00:03:01.430> piping<00:03:01.850> these<00:03:02.060> even

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
see how slowly I'm piping these even

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.120 
see how slowly I'm piping these even
with<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.840> video<00:03:03.110> sped<00:03:03.470> up<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:03.980> should

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
with the video sped up so that should

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.790 
with the video sped up so that should
give<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.370> some<00:03:04.610> idea<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.270> kind<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.470> time

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
give you some idea of the kind of time

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.430 
give you some idea of the kind of time
and<00:03:07.040> patience<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.790> takes<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.660> pipe<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
and patience that it takes to pipe the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.850 
and patience that it takes to pipe the
drop<00:03:09.800> strings<00:03:10.450> I'm<00:03:11.450> piping<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.350> string<00:03:12.680> work

that you use keep in mind that if you

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.790 
that you use keep in mind that if you
need<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.180> thinner<00:03:20.480> string<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:21.110> you're<00:03:21.260> gonna<00:03:21.380> go

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
need a thinner string if you're gonna go

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.670 
need a thinner string if you're gonna go
for<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.100> dainty<00:03:22.490> look<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:24.290> use<00:03:24.650> a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
for a dainty look then you can use a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:33.410 
for a dainty look then you can use a

the other string work design on this
practice<00:04:03.750> board<00:04:03.960> sheet<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.530> pretty<00:04:05.400> fancy<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
practice board sheet is pretty fancy and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.360 
practice board sheet is pretty fancy and
elaborate<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:06.870> called<00:04:07.290> dazzling<00:04:08.010> string

elaborate it's called dazzling string
work<00:04:08.550> again<00:04:09.030> I'm<00:04:09.180> using<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.600> tip<00:04:09.810> number<00:04:09.990> three

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
work again I'm using a tip number three

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.309 
work again I'm using a tip number three
and<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:11.069> is<00:04:11.250> just<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.580> combination<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.390> drop

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
and this is just a combination of drop

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.680 
and this is just a combination of drop
strings<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.980> then<00:04:14.459> strings<00:04:14.940> coming<00:04:15.510> down

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
strings and then strings coming down

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.539 
strings and then strings coming down
from<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.109> top<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.650> connect<00:04:17.040> them<00:04:17.130> all<00:04:17.280> and

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
from the top that connect them all and

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.819 
from the top that connect them all and
then<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.329> sides<00:04:18.600> are<00:04:18.840> finished<00:04:19.200> off<00:04:19.440> with

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
then the sides are finished off with

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.460 
then the sides are finished off with
little<00:04:20.160> dots<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.570> something<00:04:22.290> that's

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
little dots this is something that's

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.190 
little dots this is something that's
kind<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.770> dainty<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.370> elegant<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:25.020> not

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
kind of dainty and elegant and it's not

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.020 
kind of dainty and elegant and it's not
something<00:04:25.590> I've<00:04:25.710> seen<00:04:25.740> before<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:26.730> it's

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
something I've seen before I think it's

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.820 
something I've seen before I think it's
pretty<00:04:27.150> cool<00:04:27.419> again<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.260> sped<00:04:28.650> up<00:04:28.680> the

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
pretty cool again I have sped up the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.150 
pretty cool again I have sped up the
video<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.790> save<00:04:30.180> us<00:04:30.360> some<00:04:30.510> time<00:04:30.830> because<00:04:31.830> this

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
video to save us some time because this

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.490 
video to save us some time because this
is<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> technique<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.780> know<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:33.960> can't

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
is a technique that you know you can't

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.740 
is a technique that you know you can't
really<00:04:34.710> rush<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:36.270> I'll<00:04:36.450> take<00:04:36.630> this

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
really rush and I'll take this

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.810 
really rush and I'll take this
opportunity<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:38.010> remind<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.490> once<00:04:38.700> more

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
opportunity to just remind you once more

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.480 
opportunity to just remind you once more
the<00:04:39.270> importance<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:40.020> touching<00:04:40.890> your<00:04:41.040> tip<00:04:41.280> to

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
the importance of touching your tip to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.640 
the importance of touching your tip to
the<00:04:41.610> surface<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.540> icing<00:04:43.050> adheres

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
the surface so that the icing adheres

surface and letting the icing fall where
you<00:04:48.030> want<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.690> then<00:04:48.750> when<00:04:49.410> you're<00:04:49.560> ready

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.830 
to pipe the dots be sure you completely
release<00:04:52.740> pressure<00:04:53.160> on<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.640> bag<00:04:54.240> before<00:04:54.540> you

release pressure on the bag before you

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.360 
release pressure on the bag before you
pull<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.169> tip<00:04:55.350> away<00:04:55.500> so<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.950> get<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.130> nice
