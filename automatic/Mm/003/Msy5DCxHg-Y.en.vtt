completion with the player system this

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.860 
completion with the player system this
is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> Yamaha<00:00:13.849> g2<00:00:14.849> originally<00:00:15.360> manufactured

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
is the Yamaha g2 originally manufactured

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.310 
is the Yamaha g2 originally manufactured
in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.830> mid<00:00:16.949> 1970s<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.850> piano<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:18.900> completely

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
in the mid 1970s a piano was completely

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.040 
in the mid 1970s a piano was completely
restrung<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.420> we<00:00:21.420> did<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:22.279> sound<00:00:23.279> board

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
restrung and we did all do sound board

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.660 
restrung and we did all do sound board
refinishing<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.439> new<00:00:25.619> strings<00:00:26.010> that's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
refinishing on it new strings that's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
refinishing on it new strings that's
that<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> player<00:00:27.150> system<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.960> wanted<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> show

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that the player system so wanted to show

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.109 
that the player system so wanted to show
a<00:00:28.500> new<00:00:28.740> process<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.250> we're<00:00:29.849> doing<00:00:29.939> here

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
a new process that we're doing here

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
a new process that we're doing here
piano<00:00:30.480> outlet<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.769> tell<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.099> right

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
piano outlet and I can tell you right

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160 
piano outlet and I can tell you right
now<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.730> nobody<00:00:33.030> else<00:00:33.180> does<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.630> but

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
now I know that nobody else does it but

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
now I know that nobody else does it but
in<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.559> regards<00:00:34.980> we're<00:00:35.100> running<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> wire

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
in some regards we're running the wire

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.720 
in some regards we're running the wire
because<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> control<00:00:38.250> box<00:00:38.489> that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
because this is a control box that

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.209 
because this is a control box that
controls<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> volume<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.440> both<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> piano

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
controls a volume for the both the piano

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.650 
controls a volume for the both the piano
in<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> background<00:00:41.940> music<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
in the background music we have this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
in the background music we have this
this<00:00:43.350> control<00:00:43.770> box<00:00:43.920> made<00:00:44.190> special<00:00:44.730> because

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
this control box made special because

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.540 
this control box made special because
piano<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.510> does<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.930> offer<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.100> this

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
piano this does not offer it and this

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
piano this does not offer it and this
control<00:00:47.940> box<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> made<00:00:49.170> by<00:00:49.350> Richie<00:00:50.100> from<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
control box is made by Richie from the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.680 
control box is made by Richie from the
piano<00:00:50.730> gallery<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> thought<00:00:51.360> I'd<00:00:51.449> give<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
piano gallery I thought I'd give you a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.250 
piano gallery I thought I'd give you a
plug<00:00:51.899> Richie

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
plug Richie

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.959 
plug Richie
but<00:00:52.739> anyway<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.489> he<00:00:53.610> makes<00:00:53.789> these

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
but anyway so well he makes these

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450 
but anyway so well he makes these
forests<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.739> problem<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.370> we

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
forests and so the problem is that we

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.580 
forests and so the problem is that we
have<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.699> run<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> wires<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.289> front

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
have them run all the wires to the front

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.680 
have them run all the wires to the front
of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> piano<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.149> control<00:01:00.510> box

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of the piano so that this control box

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.779 
of the piano so that this control box
will<00:01:00.989> control<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> sound<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.070> previously

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
will control the sound so previously

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.709 
will control the sound so previously
what<00:01:02.969> we're<00:01:03.090> doing<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.300> we're<00:01:03.420> running<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
what we're doing is we're running the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
what we're doing is we're running the
wires<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:05.580> around<00:01:05.729> here

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
wires from here all the way around here

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.890 
wires from here all the way around here
back<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:07.080> through<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
back down through here and over to the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
back down through here and over to the
electronics<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.640> problem<00:01:11.970> isn't<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
electronics the problem isn't when you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880 
electronics the problem isn't when you
have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> leg<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.020> comes<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.650> over

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
have a leg on it comes right up over

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.929 
have a leg on it comes right up over
here<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.130> sometimes<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> wires<00:01:14.700> getting

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
here and sometimes the wires getting

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
here and sometimes the wires getting
pinched<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> came<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.020> neat<00:01:16.409> idea

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
pinched so I came up with a neat idea

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.570 
pinched so I came up with a neat idea
where<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> route<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.270> keybed<00:01:19.490> using<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
where I route out the keybed using a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.510 
where I route out the keybed using a
router<00:01:21.049> take<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.229> extra<00:01:22.500> time<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
router take some extra time but the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.050 
router take some extra time but the
result<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.330> lot<00:01:24.930> neater<00:01:26.689> wiring<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:29.060> less

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
result is a lot neater wiring and less

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
result is a lot neater wiring and less
chance<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> wire<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.259> damaged<00:01:31.799> by

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
chance for the wire to get damaged by

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.520 
chance for the wire to get damaged by
the<00:01:32.040> leg<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.790> next<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.530> pull

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the leg that's right next to it pull

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.289 
the leg that's right next to it pull
this<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> good<00:01:35.460> by<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this this is good by the way this is the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.660 
this this is good by the way this is the
pedal<00:01:36.630> support<00:01:37.200> brace<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:38.130> pedal<00:01:38.460> get

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
pedal support brace the pedal get

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
pedal support brace the pedal get
mounted<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> piece<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.840> metal<00:01:40.049> here

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
mounted to this piece of metal here

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.469 
mounted to this piece of metal here
that's<00:01:40.590> why<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:41.040> strong<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.790> anyway

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that's why it's very strong but anyway

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.539 
that's why it's very strong but anyway
as<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.619> wires<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.070> embedded

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
as you see here the wires are embedded

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.940 
as you see here the wires are embedded
in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> key<00:01:45.000> bed<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.750> they're<00:01:46.590> they're

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
in the key bed here and they're they're

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.460 
in the key bed here and they're they're
hidden<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> don't<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.930> they're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
hidden so you don't see them as they're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.679 
hidden so you don't see them as they're
running<00:01:49.740> around<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:53.299> between<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> leg<00:01:54.659> and

this<00:02:06.570> obviously<00:02:07.020> gets<00:02:07.200> covered<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> don't

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
this obviously gets covered you don't

see<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.310> when<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> piano<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.270> complete<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
see this when the piano is complete and

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.430 
see this when the piano is complete and
this<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> new<00:02:11.550> power<00:02:12.180> supply<00:02:12.390> panel

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this is a new power supply panel

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.110 
this is a new power supply panel
it's<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.710> lot<00:02:13.860> lighter<00:02:14.100> than<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> old<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.910> a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
it's a lot lighter than the old one a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.200 
it's a lot lighter than the old one a
lot<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.990> efficient<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> other

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
lot more efficient and then on the other

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.750 
lot more efficient and then on the other
side<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> piano<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.320> come<00:02:19.500> around<00:02:19.760> see

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
side of the piano you come around see

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.180 
side of the piano you come around see
how<00:02:20.850> beautiful<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.360> looks<00:02:21.390> because<00:02:22.190> basically

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
how beautiful it looks because basically

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.280 
how beautiful it looks because basically
when<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.700> get<00:02:23.850> all<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.600> strings<00:02:24.870> out<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
when we get all the strings out of the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.170 
when we get all the strings out of the
piano<00:02:25.560> we<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.860> refinish<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> soundboard<00:02:26.910> we

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
piano we can refinish the soundboard we

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.060 
piano we can refinish the soundboard we
polished<00:02:27.600> all<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.780> duplexes<00:02:28.530> all<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.770> screws

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
polished all the duplexes all the screws

decal new clear coat so basically you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.610 
decal new clear coat so basically you
have<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> new<00:02:39.120> piano<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.720> main<00:02:39.900> thing<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
have a new piano the main thing is that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.320 
have a new piano the main thing is that
when<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.670> start<00:02:41.760> with<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> piano

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
when you when you start with the piano

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.660 
when you when you start with the piano
the<00:02:42.660> finish<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.200> intact<00:02:43.560> because<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.460> really

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the finish is intact because you really

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.610 
the finish is intact because you really
don't<00:02:44.820> have<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.660> ability<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> refinish

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
don't have the ability to refinish

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.260 
don't have the ability to refinish
pianos<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.520> if<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.880> have<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> start

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
pianos and if you have to start

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.850 
pianos and if you have to start
refinishing<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> piano<00:02:49.020> then<00:02:49.230> then<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.620> really

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
refinishing a piano then then you really

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.440 
refinishing a piano then then you really
can't<00:02:50.100> sell<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.520> very<00:02:50.700> reasonably<00:02:51.150> once<00:02:51.360> you

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
can't sell it very reasonably once you

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.620 
can't sell it very reasonably once you
have<00:02:51.600> all<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.190> refinishing<00:02:53.190> work<00:02:53.400> into<00:02:53.790> it

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
have all that refinishing work into it

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.030 
have all that refinishing work into it
but<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.230> want<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.410> make<00:02:55.530> sure<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.830> pin

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
but you want to make sure that the pin

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.010 
but you want to make sure that the pin
block<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.460> good<00:02:56.730> there's<00:02:57.360> no<00:02:57.480> cracks<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
block is good there's no cracks in the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.910 
block is good there's no cracks in the
soundboard<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.830> that<00:03:00.470> everything<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.590> as<00:03:01.770> it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
soundboard and that everything is as it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.710 
soundboard and that everything is as it
should<00:03:01.980> be<00:03:02.160> when<00:03:02.730> when<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.120> left<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.330> factory

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
should be when when it left the factory

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.570 
should be when when it left the factory
and<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.590> piano<00:03:04.860> hasn't<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.220> lot<00:03:05.370> had<00:03:05.550> a

lot of wear it doesn't matter that the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.540 
lot of wear it doesn't matter that the
