00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
just occurred to me that there may be

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.080 
just occurred to me that there may be
snakes<00:02:15.959> here<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.250> haven't<00:02:17.459> marked<00:02:17.910> that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
snakes here that you haven't marked that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.270 
snakes here that you haven't marked that
I'm<00:02:18.180> about<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.569> step<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.959> oh<00:02:19.170> yes<00:02:19.470> there

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
I'm about to step on oh yes there

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.940 
I'm about to step on oh yes there
certainly<00:02:20.310> could<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:25.190> there<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> snake<00:02:26.640> head

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
certainly could be there is a snake head

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.220 
certainly could be there is a snake head
so<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> female<00:02:30.060> that's<00:02:30.660> been<00:02:30.870> an<00:02:31.019> adult

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
so this is a female that's been an adult

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.570 
so this is a female that's been an adult
female<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:31.680> been<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.010> study<00:02:32.220> for<00:02:32.459> two

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
female that's been in the study for two

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.039 
female that's been in the study for two
years<00:02:34.400> last<00:02:35.400> summer<00:02:35.700> she<00:02:35.970> gave<00:02:36.120> birth<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
years last summer she gave birth to a

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.880 
years last summer she gave birth to a
clutch<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.010> 13<00:02:38.910> babies<00:02:39.269> we<00:02:40.080> assume<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
clutch of 13 babies we assume the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.190 
clutch of 13 babies we assume the
population<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.670> fairly<00:02:41.880> strong<00:02:42.209> we

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
population here is fairly strong we

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.120 
population here is fairly strong we
don't<00:02:43.349> have<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> lot<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.799> trouble<00:02:44.040> finding

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
don't have a lot of trouble finding

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.059 
don't have a lot of trouble finding
snakes<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.959> could<00:02:46.170> very<00:02:46.380> well<00:02:46.440> walk<00:02:46.860> right

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
snakes you could very well walk right

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.030 
snakes you could very well walk right
past<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.430> rattlesnake<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.000> not<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:49.040> but

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
past a rattlesnake and not see it but

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.910 
past a rattlesnake and not see it but
the<00:02:50.190> snakes<00:02:50.459> generally<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:52.290> not<00:02:52.319> like<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.799> be
