00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.460 
found this glitch but this bitch is
basically<00:00:18.940> called<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.330> late<00:00:19.570> flip<00:00:19.870> bounce<00:00:20.080> um

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
basically called the late flip bounce um

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.250 
basically called the late flip bounce um
this<00:00:21.280> basically<00:00:21.760> you<00:00:22.420> do<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.600> late<00:00:22.840> flip<00:00:23.080> and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
this basically you do a late flip and

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.600 
this basically you do a late flip and
you<00:00:23.290> actually<00:00:23.620> bounce<00:00:23.830> really<00:00:24.220> really<00:00:24.430> high

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
you actually bounce really really high

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.850 
you actually bounce really really high
sometimes<00:00:25.360> we<00:00:25.720> need<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:25.900> do<00:00:25.990> it<00:00:26.140> usual<00:00:26.500> not<00:00:26.620> get

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
sometimes we need to do it usual not get

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.390 
sometimes we need to do it usual not get
a<00:00:26.890> high<00:00:27.720> end<00:00:28.720> amounts<00:00:29.110> of<00:00:29.320> air<00:00:29.650> or<00:00:29.920> speed<00:00:30.370> or

whatever you won't call it due to the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.080 
whatever you won't call it due to the
fact<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.469> this<00:00:32.800> game<00:00:33.039> I<00:00:33.399> was<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.789> lot<00:00:33.969> of

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
fact that this game I was a lot of

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.110 
fact that this game I was a lot of
barriers<00:00:34.539> on<00:00:34.839> the<00:00:34.899> sky<00:00:35.320> but<00:00:36.159> I<00:00:36.460> mean<00:00:36.789> me<00:00:36.999> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
barriers on the sky but I mean me and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.639 
barriers on the sky but I mean me and
knobs<00:00:37.269> II<00:00:37.420> hated<00:00:37.629> a<00:00:37.719> whole<00:00:38.019> time<00:00:38.170> then<00:00:38.350> we<00:00:38.440> flew

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
knobs II hated a whole time then we flew

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.919 
knobs II hated a whole time then we flew
really<00:00:38.980> really<00:00:39.159> high<00:00:39.309> up<00:00:39.429> in<00:00:39.519> the<00:00:39.550> sky<00:00:39.640> um<00:00:40.329> that

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
really really high up in the sky um that

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.090 
really really high up in the sky um that
should<00:00:41.199> be<00:00:41.319> playing<00:00:41.559> on<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.739> screen<00:00:41.949> right

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
should be playing on the screen right

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.559 
should be playing on the screen right
now<00:00:42.159> me<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.550> non-si<00:00:42.909> actually<00:00:43.179> hitting<00:00:43.359> it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
now me and non-si actually hitting it

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:45.149 
now me and non-si actually hitting it
now<00:00:44.170> he<00:00:44.230> has<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.499> little<00:00:44.649> bit<00:00:44.769> more<00:00:44.829> fish<00:00:45.129> than

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
now he has a little bit more fish than

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.369 
now he has a little bit more fish than
meaning<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.879> fact<00:00:46.089> that<00:00:46.359> mounted<00:00:47.199> he<00:00:47.260> was

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
meaning to the fact that mounted he was

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.930 
meaning to the fact that mounted he was
the<00:00:47.469> founder<00:00:47.769> of<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:48.039> so<00:00:48.219> he<00:00:48.339> uploaded<00:00:48.670> some

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
the founder of it so he uploaded some

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.149 
the founder of it so he uploaded some
glitches<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.659> he'll<00:00:50.050> flip<00:00:50.229> bounces<00:00:50.800> whatever

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
glitches and he'll flip bounces whatever

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.340 
glitches and he'll flip bounces whatever
to<00:00:51.729> the<00:00:51.850> EA<00:00:52.030> websites<00:00:52.510> though<00:00:52.780> those<00:00:53.140> should

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
to the EA websites though those should

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.469 
to the EA websites though those should
be<00:00:53.379> on<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.649> screen<00:00:53.710> as<00:00:53.979> well<00:00:54.100> well<00:00:54.969> I<00:00:54.999> hit<00:00:55.329> it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
be on the screen as well well I hit it

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.209 
be on the screen as well well I hit it
at<00:00:55.659> least<00:00:55.899> two<00:00:56.079> times<00:00:56.289> on<00:00:56.499> his<00:00:56.589> system<00:00:56.829> at<00:00:56.979> home

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
at least two times on his system at home

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.360 
at least two times on his system at home
the<00:00:57.579> map<00:00:57.729> is<00:00:57.879> called<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.269> split<00:00:59.170> split<00:00:59.859> field<00:01:00.219> um

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
the map is called a split split field um

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.410 
the map is called a split split field um
no<00:01:00.940> split<00:01:01.299> entrance<00:01:01.780> whatever<00:01:02.170> stay<00:01:02.949> away

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
no split entrance whatever stay away

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.030 
no split entrance whatever stay away
having<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.570> right<00:01:04.720> now<00:01:04.870> I'm<00:01:04.930> kind<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.320> caught

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
having so right now I'm kind of caught

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.150 
having so right now I'm kind of caught
up<00:01:06.220> in<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.400> game<00:01:06.580> but<00:01:07.210> um<00:01:07.650> anyways<00:01:08.650> this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
up in the game but um anyways this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.910 
up in the game but um anyways this
glitch<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:09.670> lot<00:01:10.390> easier<00:01:10.810> on<00:01:10.900> this<00:01:11.320> map<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.770> do

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
glitch is a lot easier on this map to do

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.100 
glitch is a lot easier on this map to do
due<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.550> the<00:01:12.730> fact<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.120> it's<00:01:13.390> all<00:01:13.570> flat

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
due to the fact that it's all flat

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.810 
due to the fact that it's all flat
ground<00:01:14.440> and<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.620> barriers<00:01:14.980> not<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.550> low<00:01:15.760> to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
ground and the barriers not so low to

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.990 
ground and the barriers not so low to
the<00:01:16.030> ground<00:01:16.090> so<00:01:17.280> yeah<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.490> suggest<00:01:18.820> you<00:01:18.910> to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
the ground so yeah I suggest you to

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.670 
the ground so yeah I suggest you to
practice<00:01:19.360> on<00:01:19.510> them<00:01:19.690> on<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.110> glitch<00:01:20.260> on<00:01:20.470> this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
practice on them on the glitch on this

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.770 
practice on them on the glitch on this
map<00:01:20.890> right<00:01:21.100> here<00:01:21.160> it's<00:01:21.970> all<00:01:22.240> displayed<00:01:22.630> way

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
map right here it's all displayed way

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.960 
map right here it's all displayed way
entrances<00:01:23.440> go<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.980> mid<00:01:24.400> over<00:01:24.640> here<00:01:24.820> it's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
entrances go to mid over here it's

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.580 
entrances go to mid over here it's
basically<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.480> skate<00:01:25.720> map<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:26.110> spill<00:01:26.410> it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
basically on a skate map of spill it

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.130 
basically on a skate map of spill it
it's<00:01:27.130> really<00:01:27.430> easy<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.670> do<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:27.910> here<00:01:28.180> um<00:01:28.540> you
