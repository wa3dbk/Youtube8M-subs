00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
inflow a downburst you know there's this

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.600 
inflow a downburst you know there's this
enormous<00:03:03.840> updraft<00:03:04.500> holding<00:03:04.830> up<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.100> rain<00:03:05.310> and

can't support that anymore and it all

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.770 
can't support that anymore and it all
sort<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.370> drops<00:03:08.610> out<00:03:08.790> at<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.970> bottom<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.450> the

winds hit the ground compressed and you

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
wind that's down burst and it looks like

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.000

shoreline of lake erie and that's
because<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.890> pretty<00:03:26.190> powerful<00:03:26.519> late<00:03:27.180> spring

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
because this pretty powerful late spring

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.820 
because this pretty powerful late spring
storm<00:03:27.810> they<00:03:27.930> rolled<00:03:28.110> by<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.590> south

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830

storm they rolled by just the south
lower<00:03:29.100> Lakes<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.580> enough<00:03:29.820> spin<00:03:30.299> there<00:03:30.600> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
lower Lakes and enough spin there to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.509 
lower Lakes and enough spin there to
allow<00:03:31.530> one<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.920> those<00:03:32.040> very<00:03:32.250> strong

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
thunderstorms to spin up a tornado so

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.030 
thunderstorms to spin up a tornado so
again<00:03:35.160> we'll<00:03:35.310> continue<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.700> bring<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.850> that
