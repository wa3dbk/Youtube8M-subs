00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.429
 also the structure of German insiders 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.070
 he has millions of people in poorer countries 2 become the children 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.039
 Button 2 is her 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.189
 obviously the producers and suppliers 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.710
 7 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.140
 Ground forces would 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.270
 until the 20th 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.290
 But that changes with what is now surpassing again this is on the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.750
 best way are b 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.040
 so cheap but is usually free 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.280
 I have hopefully never realized so it was also two keys 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.230
 bequeath 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.500
 the cmos sensor is four minutes behind this 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.230
 Nixon again encouraged investors to do something less now 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.980
 the special case 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.510
 quarter 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.590
 there you are my pet with 4 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 Years later finished 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.620
 many ready 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.580
 how finished 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.580
 we're done 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810
 now the depth continues to fight violently 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.730
 I also think that three more counters 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.330
 20 20 12 insurers are all patients at Trun 7 Victory and after 8 years 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.970
 I'm done you do not come anymore 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.180
 yes then I would say Percent Richard is getting closer and closer together 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 first task but actually mastered 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.280
 40 still the we are not out of them we were still open for the time being in the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 Studio 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.410
 and then your living room is already following up on the next task, so percent 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.140
 Stetten reversed 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 that was my answer 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.700
 I had only a few new tasks 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.340
 yes no SIM installed zuzog yes yes that is demonstrated with Kiel 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.680
 instead of 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.580
 continue the ORF 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.020
 is first exploited and looks forward to the course of the next issues 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:12.009
 This does not exist before we do one duty a few 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.800
 All people know about the next interesting tasks 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.359
 little wind and 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.919
 strange tasks 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.599
 The growing volume of data is also wanted in Denmark and Canada 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.599
 not quite as easy to get around the corner 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.149
 breathes the Focus continued reporting image 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.149
 Cape Town half 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:40.329
 actually will
