00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
took on you know at 17 and had a really

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.750 
took on you know at 17 and had a really
badass<00:01:10.680> fight<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.610> could

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

we're gonna get the piccolo that showed
up<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.259> best<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.680> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
up I think what would be best for in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
up I think what would be best for in
terms<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.119> good<00:01:18.420> fight<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
terms of a good fight is if we got the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
terms of a good fight is if we got the
piccolo<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:21.090> showed<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:22.939> right<00:01:23.939> before<00:01:24.330> he
