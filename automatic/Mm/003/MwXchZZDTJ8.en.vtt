particular game so should be interesting

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.940 
particular game so should be interesting
yes<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> ZBZ<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.210> game<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.780> has<00:00:45.930> changed<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.710> lot

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
yes a ZBZ a game which has changed a lot

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.360 
yes a ZBZ a game which has changed a lot
since<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.730> past<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.149> couple<00:00:48.390> patches<00:00:49.129> yeah<00:00:50.129> I'm

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
since the past a couple patches yeah I'm

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
since the past a couple patches yeah I'm
I<00:00:50.700> guess<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:52.110> things<00:00:52.379> number<00:00:52.620> one

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I guess it's just two things number one

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.430 
I guess it's just two things number one
row<00:00:53.579> charmer<00:00:54.030> being<00:00:54.420> decrease<00:00:54.870> from<00:00:54.989> 2<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> 1

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
row charmer being decrease from 2 to 1

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
row charmer being decrease from 2 to 1
means<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.640> zerglings

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
means you can actually use zerglings

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.799 
means you can actually use zerglings
which<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> crazy<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.640> also<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.090> Korean<00:01:00.449> style

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
which is crazy and also the Korean style

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.439 
which is crazy and also the Korean style
of<00:01:01.170> zergling<00:01:02.039> baneling<00:01:02.489> noodles<00:01:02.850> starting<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
of zergling baneling noodles starting to

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
of zergling baneling noodles starting to
spill<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.019> little<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.409> into<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> US<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
spill over a little more into the US and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.899 
spill over a little more into the US and
euro<00:01:05.970> servers<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.130> creates<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:08.760> more

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
euro servers so it creates a lot more

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
euro servers so it creates a lot more
dynamic<00:01:09.570> play<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:10.560> decisions<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
dynamic play it's actually decisions to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.020 
dynamic play it's actually decisions to
make<00:01:11.729> besides<00:01:12.150> win<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.869> upgrade<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.290> roaches

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
make besides win to upgrade your roaches

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.800 
make besides win to upgrade your roaches

which dessert has a natural advantage

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920 
which dessert has a natural advantage
actually<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.270> creek<00:01:27.600> which

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
actually because of the creek which

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
actually because of the creek which
covers<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> blistering<00:01:29.549> sand

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
covers up all of the blistering sand

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
covers up all of the blistering sand
which<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.840> course<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:31.200> hot<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.220> you

can rate of this game that would be
pretty<00:02:05.729> weird<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:06.840> wearing<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.110> green

those eggs that spawning pool and that
extractor<00:02:19.280> quite<00:02:20.280> interesting<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:20.880> I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
extractor quite interesting that I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.500 
extractor quite interesting that I
wanted<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:21.720> for<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> by<00:02:22.590> color<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:24.420> know

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
wanted going for a by color you know

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.200 
wanted going for a by color you know
bike<00:02:24.870> romatic<00:02:25.710> kind<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.610> feel<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.180> there

bike romatic kind of feel up there

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.150 
bike romatic kind of feel up there
actually<00:02:27.780> might<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:27.990> sisters<00:02:28.440> time<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.980> was

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
actually might be sisters time if I was

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.460 
actually might be sisters time if I was
feeling<00:02:29.190> pretty<00:02:29.610> good<00:02:29.880> not<00:02:30.840> not<00:02:31.050> necessarily

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
feeling pretty good not not necessarily

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.810 
feeling pretty good not not necessarily
because<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.860> Christmas<00:02:32.250> time<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.610> just

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
because it is Christmas time but just

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.060 
because it is Christmas time but just
cuz<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.090> particular<00:02:33.540> color<00:02:34.070> combination

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
cuz that particular color combination

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.280 
cuz that particular color combination
makes<00:02:35.220> happy<00:02:35.460> associations<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.690> make<00:02:37.080> them

makes happy associations that make them

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.140 
makes happy associations that make them
work<00:02:37.650> more<00:02:37.950> efficiently<00:02:38.160> without<00:02:38.580> even

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
work more efficiently without even
