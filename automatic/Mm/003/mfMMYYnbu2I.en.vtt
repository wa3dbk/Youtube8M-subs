in our area but that could change let me
show<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.539> why<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:10.890> we're<00:02:11.069> tracking<00:02:11.340> right

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
show you why what we're tracking right

show you why what we're tracking right
now<00:02:11.760> is

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
now is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.850 
now is
is<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:14.060> energy<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.050> upper<00:02:15.440> levels<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:15.800> the

is the energy in the upper levels of the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.560 
is the energy in the upper levels of the
atmosphere<00:02:15.950> how<00:02:16.490> do<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:16.730> see<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.330> is

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
atmosphere how do we see that this is

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.290 
atmosphere how do we see that this is
real<00:02:17.840> time<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.560> infrared<00:02:19.300> satellite

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300

this little piece of energy right over
california<00:02:27.770> you're<00:02:28.070> seeing<00:02:28.310> this<00:02:28.430> little

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
california you're seeing this little

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.130 
california you're seeing this little
swirl<00:02:29.060> right<00:02:29.360> there<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.660> upper<00:02:29.750> levels<00:02:30.110> of

swirl right there in the upper levels of
the<00:02:30.200> atmosphere<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.920> basically<00:02:31.460> gives<00:02:31.580> us

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
the atmosphere this basically gives us

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.350 
the atmosphere this basically gives us
precipitation<00:02:33.410> at<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.860> ground<00:02:34.160> when<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.150> talk

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
precipitation at the ground when we talk

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.780 
precipitation at the ground when we talk
about<00:02:35.390> models<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.230> models<00:02:36.710> are<00:02:36.860> not<00:02:37.160> what's

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
about models the models are not what's

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.180 
about models the models are not what's
giving<00:02:38.090> us<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.360> snow<00:02:38.630> its<00:02:38.900> energy<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.740> the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
giving us the snow its energy in the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.920 
giving us the snow its energy in the
atmosphere<00:02:40.220> that's<00:02:40.940> giving<00:02:41.210> us<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.450> snow<00:02:41.720> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
atmosphere that's giving us the snow and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.020 
atmosphere that's giving us the snow and
we<00:02:42.410> measure<00:02:42.710> that<00:02:42.980> by<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.280> models<00:02:43.850> now<00:02:44.000> I

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
we measure that by the models now I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.660 
we measure that by the models now I
showed<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.480> what's<00:02:44.720> currently<00:02:45.260> happening

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
showed you what's currently happening

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.310 
showed you what's currently happening
now<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.730> talked<00:02:47.210> about<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.720> 18<00:02:50.020> zeros<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
now we talked about the 18 zeros and it

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.820 
now we talked about the 18 zeros and it
went<00:02:51.800> crazy<00:02:52.130> for<00:02:52.520> us<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.850> showed<00:02:53.090> us<00:02:53.330> 12<00:02:54.230> inches

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
went crazy for us it showed us 12 inches

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.310 
went crazy for us it showed us 12 inches
of<00:02:55.040> snow<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.550> Greenville<00:02:56.300> let<00:02:57.020> me<00:02:57.110> show<00:02:57.290> you

creates this low off the coast of the
Carolinas<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.200> women<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:28.489> get<00:03:28.790> lots<00:03:29.150> of

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
Carolinas and women you get lots of

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.530 
Carolinas and women you get lots of
moisture<00:03:29.570> back<00:03:30.530> into<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.340> Western<00:03:32.180> zones

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
moisture back into the Western zones

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.420 
moisture back into the Western zones
that's<00:03:32.930> what<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.380> models<00:03:33.709> are<00:03:33.800> trending<00:03:34.280> it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
that's what the models are trending it

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.370 
that's what the models are trending it
not<00:03:34.640> just<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.090> one<00:03:35.390> deterministic<00:03:36.080> model

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
not just this one deterministic model

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.979 
not just this one deterministic model
but<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.620> ensemble's<00:03:37.400> which<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.269> group<00:03:38.840> of

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
but the ensemble's which is a group of

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.530 
but the ensemble's which is a group of
all<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.380> them<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:40.519> absorbs<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.180> at<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.360> right

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
all of them it absorbs it at the right

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.199 
all of them it absorbs it at the right
time<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:43.160> that's<00:03:43.280> why<00:03:43.459> we're<00:03:43.640> watching<00:03:44.030> so

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
time so that's why we're watching so

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.900 
time so that's why we're watching so
let's<00:03:44.450> let's<00:03:44.630> go<00:03:44.810> back<00:03:45.019> here<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.580> what

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
let's let's go back here this is what

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.940 
let's let's go back here this is what
the<00:03:47.060> model<00:03:47.269> had<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:47.810> let's<00:03:48.410> see<00:03:48.530> if<00:03:48.590> it's<00:03:48.709> right

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
the model had it let's see if it's right

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.240 
the model had it let's see if it's right
it<00:03:49.850> had<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.900> be<00:03:51.050> right<00:03:51.530> off<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.890> western

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
it had this to be right off the western

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.690 
it had this to be right off the western
coast<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.910> California<00:03:53.750> here<00:03:54.560> at<00:03:54.709> about<00:03:54.950> 10pm

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
coast of California here at about 10pm

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.390 
coast of California here at about 10pm
let's<00:03:56.150> see<00:03:56.269> if<00:03:56.360> it's<00:03:56.510> right<00:03:57.400> current

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
let's see if it's right current

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.210 
let's see if it's right current
conditions<00:03:59.080> yeah<00:04:00.080> if<00:04:00.410> anything<00:04:00.769> it's<00:04:01.130> a

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
conditions yeah if anything it's a

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.830 
conditions yeah if anything it's a
little<00:04:01.459> bit<00:04:01.610> further<00:04:01.790> south<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.600> will<00:04:02.720> get

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
little bit further south so it will get

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.130 
little bit further south so it will get
absorbed<00:04:03.280> just<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.400> little<00:04:04.610> faster<00:04:04.959> let's<00:04:05.959> show

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
absorbed just a little faster let's show

still comes in pretty good distance
toward<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.940> west<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:47.360> Columbia<00:04:47.900> will<00:04:48.680> see<00:04:48.830> the
