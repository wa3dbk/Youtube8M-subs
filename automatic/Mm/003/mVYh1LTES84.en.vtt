00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.850
 Hey people, welcome to isi 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.720
 computers 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.240
 here is our channel will have many 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.750
 tutorials several tips games and so on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.880
 against 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.280
 First let's talk about something that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.619
 everyone has by far the best 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.470
 Less has asked me a lot, I'm 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.510
 Seeing so speaks that being the staff 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.390
 There is no doubt about such a simple thing. 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.320
 It has many notebooks they are having 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.960
 with intel hd graphics today 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.620
 necessarily we will talk not of it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.010
 intel genial another family that is in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.630
 change of bass that most of the time 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 accompanied with the teacher since 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.180
 then and in larger houses than we are 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.140
 just wants to know 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.940
 a setup to play a game with 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.490
 better quality if it is proved that 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.119
 such a notebook that I bought from cef 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.910
 o aspire 43 49 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.789
 I took the factory with 2gb increase 4 and 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.590
 accepts at most eight good is not me 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.720
 surprised because it has a quality 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.280
 great for games games here from 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.459
 fighter live left was there 2013 to fifa 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 What else is I got here like 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:42.300
 contain three i have 40 ze look the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 walking dead episode 3 also has design 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.110
 Quiet fashion so be sure to train 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.800
 but I think it was the friendship but the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.929
 setting up the video card with the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.399
 right- click graphic properties is 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:02.099
 very simple I always prefer here 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.340
 advanced mode because you will have a 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.989
 in this case three of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.360
 mines and energy that we are going to do 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:15.440
 primarily at maximum resolution 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.810
 When to get rock rock in 3d 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.280
 here I tried to do in the tests not 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.560
 played here in the balance that was 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.270
 advises quality apply ok 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.220
 I always leave in quality 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.740
 I say that I have already tested a balance of 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.940
 Obvious performance assistant will you 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.710
 let the performance will have a 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.820
 better performance in games will get a 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.530
 filth 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.270
 the graph and you will start to get 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.370
 Brava was already playing is not 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.440
 You can play in the quality of the card 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.200
 at most five would be advisable 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.580
 Do people who have a notebook with 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.160
 At least 4 gb is 2 say already happened 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.680
 leaving balanced that unfortunately the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.440
 performance is the same ct performance 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.080
 but in case we are talking about the good tv 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.690
 performance and quality having 4 gb 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.440
 good fish processor maintains the quality 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.390
 of energy to the secret here comes if not 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.820
 I'm mistaken for factory in the balance 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.190
 some realm of the battery to 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.480
 autonomy but leave maximum performance 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.410
 for him to get full 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.090
 I already was if I did not have clicks and apply 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.549
 ok're remembering if you have your note 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.200
 I know that energy gives always leaves the 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.510
 our performance when playing 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.850
 Okay. I'm sure the games will go. 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.430
 run better at that time using the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.049
 fantasy using here or sony vegas that 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.910
 I am preparing a video of a door 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.540
 very good glass carries enough thing 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.440
 In the fossa go quiet and Grandpa will
