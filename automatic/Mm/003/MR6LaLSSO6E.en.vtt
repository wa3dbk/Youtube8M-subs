chances<00:01:49.030> are<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.690> small<00:01:49.990> tornado<00:01:50.320> that

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
chances are this is a small tornado that

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.700 
chances are this is a small tornado that
is<00:01:51.130> very<00:01:51.759> difficult<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.479> pick<00:01:52.659> up<00:01:52.690> on<00:01:53.229> on

is very difficult to pick up on on
conventional<00:01:54.430> Doppler<00:01:54.850> radar<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:55.360> we<00:01:55.479> do<00:01:55.690> rely

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140

reports of hail in Brooklyn Park and
that<00:07:29.690> would<00:07:29.870> go<00:07:30.050> along<00:07:30.350> typically<00:07:30.920> with

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.130 
that would go along typically with

that would go along typically with

tornadoes even a small tornado hail is a

tornadoes even a small tornado hail is a

absolutely<00:07:35.870> the<00:07:36.230> two<00:07:36.620> seem<00:07:36.890> to<00:07:37.010> go

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130 
absolutely the two seem to go

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.730 
absolutely the two seem to go
hand-in-hand<00:07:37.610> it<00:07:38.150> it<00:07:38.660> doesn't<00:07:39.530> always

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740 
hand-in-hand it it doesn't always

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.500 
hand-in-hand it it doesn't always
necessarily<00:07:40.100> mean<00:07:40.730> that<00:07:40.760> when<00:07:41.090> you<00:07:41.180> have<00:07:41.360> a

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.510 
necessarily mean that when you have a

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.110 
necessarily mean that when you have a
leader<00:07:41.810> of<00:07:41.870> a<00:07:41.960> tornado<00:07:42.350> but<00:07:42.650> it's<00:07:43.430> no<00:07:43.670> surprise

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 
leader of a tornado but it's no surprise

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.570 
leader of a tornado but it's no surprise
to<00:07:44.150> me<00:07:44.390> it<00:07:44.570> just<00:07:44.600> indicates<00:07:45.200> the<00:07:45.740> lifting<00:07:46.250> and

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.580 
to me it just indicates the lifting and

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.790 
to me it just indicates the lifting and
strength<00:07:47.300> of<00:07:47.510> these<00:07:47.630> thunderstorms<00:07:48.320> and

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 
strength of these thunderstorms and

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.260 
strength of these thunderstorms and
again<00:07:49.010> when<00:07:49.160> a<00:07:49.190> tornado<00:07:49.610> is<00:07:49.850> it's<00:07:50.120> an

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270 
again when a tornado is it's an

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.660 
again when a tornado is it's an
outgrowth<00:07:50.540> of<00:07:51.170> a<00:07:51.650> general<00:07:52.100> thunderstorm

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:52.670 
outgrowth of a general thunderstorm

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.450 
outgrowth of a general thunderstorm
circulation<00:07:53.540> and<00:07:53.780> it's<00:07:54.500> it<00:07:54.830> is<00:07:55.070> literally

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:55.460 
circulation and it's it is literally

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.330 
circulation and it's it is literally
you're<00:07:55.730> taking<00:07:56.120> all<00:07:56.270> the<00:07:56.480> circulation<00:07:57.230> in<00:07:58.190> a

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:58.340 
you're taking all the circulation in a

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.340 
you're taking all the circulation in a
thunderstorm<00:07:58.670> and<00:07:59.180> concentrating<00:08:00.020> it<00:08:00.140> to<00:08:00.320> a

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.350 
thunderstorm and concentrating it to a

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.380 
thunderstorm and concentrating it to a
small<00:08:00.740> spot<00:08:01.070> along<00:08:01.280> the<00:08:01.310> ground<00:08:01.610> and<00:08:02.060> that<00:08:02.330> is

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.390 
small spot along the ground and that is

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.040 
small spot along the ground and that is
a<00:08:02.570> tornado<00:08:02.900> it<00:08:03.590> looks<00:08:04.340> like<00:08:04.640> to<00:08:04.970> me<00:08:05.000> and<00:08:05.330> I<00:08:05.390> he

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.050 
a tornado it looks like to me and I he

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.570 
a tornado it looks like to me and I he
doesn't<00:08:06.410> take<00:08:06.500> to<00:08:06.680> say<00:08:06.860> this<00:08:07.070> it<00:08:07.220> look<00:08:07.370> like<00:08:07.550> a

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:07.580 
doesn't take to say this it look like a

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.850 
doesn't take to say this it look like a
lot<00:08:08.150> smaller<00:08:08.510> tornadoes<00:08:08.810> but<00:08:09.350> nonetheless

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:09.860 
lot smaller tornadoes but nonetheless

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.790 
lot smaller tornadoes but nonetheless
it's<00:08:10.430> something<00:08:10.820> that<00:08:11.030> you<00:08:12.020> definitely<00:08:12.290> have

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 
it's something that you definitely have

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.580 
it's something that you definitely have
to<00:08:13.000> protect<00:08:14.000> yourself<00:08:14.330> against<00:08:14.750> right<00:08:15.410> now

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:15.590 
to protect yourself against right now

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.130 
to protect yourself against right now
again<00:08:16.130> it<00:08:16.310> appears<00:08:16.430> to<00:08:16.850> like<00:08:17.000> we<00:08:17.210> have<00:08:17.390> real

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:18.140 
again it appears to like we have real

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.460 
again it appears to like we have real
real<00:08:18.800> circulation
