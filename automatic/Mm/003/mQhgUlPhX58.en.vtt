grenade launcher and an assault rifle of

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.549 
grenade launcher and an assault rifle of
some<00:00:43.800> kind<00:00:44.510> maybe<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.110> we'll<00:00:46.469> go

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
some kind maybe not that one we'll go

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
some kind maybe not that one we'll go
with<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.710> cheaper<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
with the cheaper one and there you go so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779 
with the cheaper one and there you go so
the<00:00:49.020> only<00:00:49.170> downside<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.860> glitch<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the only downside to this glitch is that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.060 
the only downside to this glitch is that
you<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> spend<00:00:51.510> money<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.199> weapon<00:00:52.500> if

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you have to spend money on the weapon if

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
you have to spend money on the weapon if
you<00:00:53.309> already<00:00:53.430> own<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.910> multiplayer<00:00:54.180> but

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you already own them in multiplayer but

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.830 
you already own them in multiplayer but
it's<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.489> make<00:00:56.820> money<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.480> level

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's not really to make money or level

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
it's not really to make money or level
up<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.440> kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:59.129> fun<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.760> troll

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
up it's just kind of have fun and troll

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
up it's just kind of have fun and troll
other<00:01:00.420> players<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.140> maybe<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.440> friend

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
other players and maybe your friend

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.280 
other players and maybe your friend
so<00:01:02.460> anyway<00:01:03.090> you'll<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> weapons<00:01:04.170> for

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
so anyway you'll have the weapons for

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.660 
so anyway you'll have the weapons for
the<00:01:04.350> rest<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> round<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.250> buy<00:01:05.400> them

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the rest of the round once you buy them

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.670 
the rest of the round once you buy them
and<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.049> use<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> ammo

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and if you don't use up all the ammo

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.560 
and if you don't use up all the ammo
you'll<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.159> able<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> keep<00:01:08.520> them<00:01:08.760> once<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you'll be able to keep them once the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.300 
you'll be able to keep them once the
so<00:01:09.690> it's<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.230> total<00:01:10.470> waste<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> money<00:01:10.980> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so it's not a total waste of money so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 
so it's not a total waste of money so
you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.360> everyone<00:01:13.020> has<00:01:13.140> shotguns
