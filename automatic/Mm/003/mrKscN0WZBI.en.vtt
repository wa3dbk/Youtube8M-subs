short<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.340> sweet<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.969> only<00:00:12.120> kept<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.509> short

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
short and sweet and I only kept it short

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.379 
short and sweet and I only kept it short
and<00:00:12.870> sweet<00:00:12.960> because<00:00:13.280> well<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:14.639> still<00:00:15.150> sick

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
and sweet because well I'm still sick

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.060 
and sweet because well I'm still sick
and<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:16.049> pretty<00:00:16.199> much<00:00:16.289> lose<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:16.830> train<00:00:17.010> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and I pretty much lose my train of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790 
and I pretty much lose my train of
thought<00:00:17.190> after<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> few<00:00:18.240> words<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.140> Scentsy

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
thought after a few words and Scentsy

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.080 
thought after a few words and Scentsy
I'm<00:00:19.949> already<00:00:20.189> losing<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.760> train<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.000> thought

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
I'm already losing my train of thought

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.060 
I'm already losing my train of thought
so<00:00:21.449> I'll<00:00:21.869> probably<00:00:22.080> make<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.619> advanced

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
so I'll probably make a more advanced

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.620 
so I'll probably make a more advanced
version<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.640> later<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.449> future

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
version of this later on in the future

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
version of this later on in the future
but<00:00:25.289> right<00:00:25.350> now<00:00:25.590> we're<00:00:25.710> gonna<00:00:25.769> keep<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.099> nice

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
but right now we're gonna keep it nice

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.130 
but right now we're gonna keep it nice

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
many times you got to hit the note block

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.750 
many times you got to hit the note block
so<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.129> build<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:05.369> gonna<00:01:05.460> need<00:01:05.640> at

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
so for this build we're gonna need at

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.690 
so for this build we're gonna need at
least<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.119> 5<00:01:06.570> by<00:01:06.960> 14<00:01:07.590> spacing<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
least a 5 by 14 spacing as you can see I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.719 
least a 5 by 14 spacing as you can see I
started<00:01:09.090> making<00:01:09.270> these<00:01:09.540> little<00:01:09.990> visa

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
started making these little visa

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.890 
started making these little visa
pathways<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.000> bit<00:01:12.090> bigger<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
pathways a little bit bigger because the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
pathways a little bit bigger because the
sound<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.320> travel<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.860> little<00:01:13.979> bit<00:01:14.130> further

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
sound can travel a little bit further

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.960 
sound can travel a little bit further
now<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> first<00:01:16.320> note<00:01:16.590> block<00:01:16.890> let<00:01:17.880> me

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
now so for the first note block let me

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
now so for the first note block let me
just<00:01:18.180> open<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> first<00:01:19.799> note<00:01:19.979> block

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just open this the first note block

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.320 
just open this the first note block
we're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> put<00:01:20.610> down<00:01:20.729> right<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
we're going to put down right here and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.219 
we're going to put down right here and
this<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> hit<00:01:22.200> 18

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.240 

then<00:01:27.229> we<00:01:27.320> will<00:01:27.409> put<00:01:27.500> our<00:01:27.590> repeater<00:01:27.829> behind<00:01:28.130> it

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
then we will put our repeater behind it

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.020 
then we will put our repeater behind it
