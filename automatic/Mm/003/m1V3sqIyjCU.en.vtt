00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.139
 first concerns about the new simcity 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.360
 appeared when the maxi with 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.910
 announced the full transition of the game in 3d 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.070
 everyone understood that for the sake of beauty 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 have to sacrifice scale 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.149
 another promised innovation 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.149
 was that simcity should 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.739
 was to become fully online and 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.910
 cooperative game fans old school 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.770
 town planning simulators 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 treated this development plan with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
 suspicion as it turned out not in vain 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.120
 We present to your attention a video review 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.120
 games simcity 2013 from playground.ru 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.470
 the first thing that catches the eyes of the new 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.110
 the eye maxim's god didn't deceive and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.690
 brought her groups full 3d camera 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.640
 rotates arbitrarily allowing you to 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.280
 all details consider your city 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.470
 life is in full swing right in front of you 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.120
 go back and forth in the stream of cars 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
 and every inhabitant is no longer just 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.380
 abstract concepts 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.240
 and the real identity of the townspeople go on 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.400
 work waiting for the bus at bus stops 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.350
 having fun getting sick stealing everyone 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.410
 happens in front of your nose 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.420
 eye boxing looks amazing visual 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.759
 component simcity no complaints and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.619
 can not be with the new engine maxis 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.050
 completely changed the statistics system and 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.850
 key game indicators familiar 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.800
 graphics have been replaced by special 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.080
 system overlay which clearly 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.530
 display all the processes occurring in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.979
 the city 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.240
 this is not a simplification of statistics 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.100
 on communal and social 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.770
 infrastructure nowhere do she 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.290
 just began to look different and need 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.240
 say very effectively 7 networks in this 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.940
 urban planning plan new 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.649
 generations in a good way very much 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.100
 sorry but for the listed advantages 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.780
 there are no other advantages to the game yet 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.179
 admire your new ones as much as you like 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.950
 three-dimensional cities but note that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.230
 sizes become much smaller 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.270
 developers are chasing the players too 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.540
 narrow frame town planning simulator 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.850
 turned into a simulator seal place 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.950
 sorely lacking and such 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.100
 key buildings as fire stations 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.780
 police stations of hospitals and schools and 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.600
 universities financial centers and other 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.270
 take so much space for everything else 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 it simply does not stay on its own 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.200
 provide yourself with everything you need 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.700
 simply impossible therefore by most 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.250
 buildings that you can enter 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.410
 build will have to donate it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.120
 puts you utter dependence on 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.580
 cities of neighbors which now 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.530
 managed by other users can 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.270
 share resources and labor and 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.580
 provide each other the most 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.950
 various services 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.830
 single player how would you not want you 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.350
 do not get with the axis as if forgot 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.670
 consider one important point literate 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.710
 cooperation in urban planning 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.950
 simulator between completely random 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.020
 people are almost impossible if you 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.180
 playing with friends no problem you 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.580
 assign roles in advance and get 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.320
 pleasure who extracts resources someone 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.630
 recycles waste someone builds a city 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.180
 full of shops and someone engaged 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.670
 the concept of education and treatment is good 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.170
 but again, it only works 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.480
 if you are lucky 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.310
 stumble upon good neighbors just one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.850
 a gouging player can ruin a whole 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.560
 region and as a result of it all will leave 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.720
 of course you can always create private 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.120
 game and try to set up right away 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.510
 several cities do not get along between them 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.600
 connection 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.490
 however, this is not at all what 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.500
 build a whole bunch of tiny not up 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.170
 megalopolises instead of engaging 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.459
 creating a truly big city 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.470
 as it was before 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.990
 by itself here not in the least 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.870
 blame new beautiful engine which 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.880
 simply won't pull huge cities like 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.489
 we already said that it had to be painted over 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.890
 pay scale one more 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.810
 the problem of the game is not an opportunity to somehow 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.630
 to control density 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.730
 population of the city is constantly growing seeding 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.310
 let's transport problems only 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.290
 the exit is not to build wide roads since 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.580
 building type is tightly tied to type 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.010
 adjacent highway 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.290
 but if you deliberately lay 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.210
 narrow roads hoping to keep low 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.850
 population density then problems with 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.790
 transport you also can not avoid yet 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.830
 what is it a vicious circle 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.740
 they say that beauty will save the world but the world 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.380
 only not sim city the game is great 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.800
 looks and sounds great 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.330
 it's big too big victims 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.220
 ill-conceived online gameplay abundance 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.350
 problems with servers and flaws in 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.700
 the mechanics of the game does not yet allow 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.560
 give her a better mark 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.560
 Good luck and see you on the playground.ru
