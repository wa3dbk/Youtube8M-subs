00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello my name is waiting for the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.120
 shop seen elsewhere in Paris 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.580
 today we will tackle thematic 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.870
 important how to choose glasses 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.839
 according to the shape of the face 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 choosing glasses is not easy 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.900
 will depend on the shape of your face 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.570
 of your personality the color of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 pau hair before anything else it takes 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.060
 identify the shape we have shapes 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.199
 long ovals earlier lying that's it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.099
 which is simpler suited you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.529
 can put what you want in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.390
 Round rectangular square shape 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.790
 matters for round faces it is enough 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.860
 to take rectangular forms of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.370
 way to contrast with the traits of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.280
 your face 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 as an example for a round face 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.879
 could take a telescope 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 rectangular for example like this 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 a very fine metal worn on the face 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.800
 that would allow us to contrast with 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 the roundness of being is much more 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 pretty bring now with regard to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.309
 regards face shapes rather 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.199
 square the ideal being to take some 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.940
 oval shapes or round shapes 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.799
 again to contrast with the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.770
 shape your face and soften the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.590
 traits we will focus more on 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.960
 ethane frames for people 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.549
 who have faces wide enough this will be 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.689
 much easier to fit a small 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.000
 little less present than a telescope 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.520
 acetate stops now for 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.369
 triangle shapes rather upwards 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.450
 or rather down 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.729
 overall it's the same principle it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.990
 just to homogenize the shape of the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.759
 face so for the triangles 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.229
 teach me a thicker shape on the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.670
 pot of emissaries key see with 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.490
 wide branches it will compensate for a small 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.979
 little face shape for them 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 low triangles the people who have a 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.320
 year are rather wide and jaws 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.290
 rather drawn and such a fear that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.119
 by a little more up prefer 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.009
 acetate frames for example a 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.409
 little more typed on the top and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.060
 rather fluttering to give a 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.509
 form a structure with a lot of face 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.799
 more homogeneous and regular then subject 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.439
 a little bit more particular 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.539
 small face shapes the secret is 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.380
 to take a telescope obviously not 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.800
 too wide 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.600
 m especially with one on those very fine dates 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.060
 I mean that the plastic of 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.620
 glasses should not be noticed that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.470
 will highlight your traits of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.940
 face and give you a side 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.540
 much more natural when you wear 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.030
 glasses 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.940
 as an example this bezel you 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.670
 have a thickness of 3 4 mm on the face 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.680
 very very well drawn 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.600
 but not marked a little tip for 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.190
 people who have a small form 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.660
 of faces or on the contrary that they are 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.500
 very large or who do not find 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.300
 adapted glasses 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.740
 I would say the easiest in the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.090
 first case it would be either take some 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.890
 shuttle bus that does not see them so the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.140
 glasses drill this will be a lot more 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.580
 easy to adapt 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.260
 yeah even call it glasses plug 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.010
 and play because it's really going on the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.740
 most faces 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.970
 now you have all the 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.370
 keys to choose your glasses 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.260
 correctly of course that remains 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.390
 theoretical there are two criteria to take 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.530
 counts the personality criteria 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.380
 glass criteria your correction 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.490
 should be adapted on it and it is 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.020
 still interesting to have the opinion 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.520
 of a specialist who will guide you when 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.850
 even better in choosing your 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.850
 mount
