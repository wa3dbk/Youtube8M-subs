again<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> shoutcast<00:00:48.200> application<00:00:49.219> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
again this is a shoutcast application so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.510 
again this is a shoutcast application so
the<00:00:50.640> bottom<00:00:50.910> line<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.270> streaming<00:00:52.050> images

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
the bottom line is streaming images

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
the bottom line is streaming images
pretty<00:00:53.520> much<00:00:54.110> that's<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.440> does<00:00:55.590> anyway

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
pretty much that's what it does anyway

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.959 
pretty much that's what it does anyway
I've<00:00:56.160> been<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.640> very<00:00:58.460> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> lookout<00:00:59.910> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
I've been very very on the lookout I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.549

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
guess you can say for an application

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.759 
guess you can say for an application
that<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.370> basically<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.820> media<00:01:03.500> player<00:01:04.500> or
