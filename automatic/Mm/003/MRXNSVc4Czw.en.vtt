00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.219
 People have to order the most wonderful things for a living 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.199
 benefit support against the pyrenees and she takes the other board 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.160
 mackerel and the other 20 German poodles 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.469
 influenced by all molars and the other cooks capuchins with bacon 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
 the one stunned and worn out succeeds, and the other breeds cape violets 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.130
 we build and full full 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.510
 this program is not a course book 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.640
 it's just an impression of how I am here in this huge factory complex 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.440
 that covers no less than a million square meters 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 a number of people work together on one in their own place 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.150
 quality product 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
 the factory is divided into 4 main sections 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.380
 the terstall 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.760
 from which high-quality steel parts for the body are manufactured 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.460
 the body builder 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 where the various plots are combined 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.560
 the paint shop 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.710
 and the final assembly but the car is finally being phased out 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.700
 but who now thinks that after seeing this program, he is in a Opel factory 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 his back yard could begin 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.890
 he is very wrong 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.730
 car builder is really a bit more complicated than the children of a rabbit hutch 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.100
 let's start from the beginning 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.760
 the supply of the material 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.420
 100 points articles 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.410
 from engines to speed meters 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.580
 because car tires to seat covers 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.800
 all of which are supplied by suppliers 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.939
 for all 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.939
 basic material for the automobile industry 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.099
 a matter of great weight 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
 also literally 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.229
 4 piece by piece to their own place 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.069
 between 10 and 20 tons 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.879
 more and more steel within that agreed in advance 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.789
 forms an important protection against the occurrence of rust 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.449
 nowadays, in all possible languages, they all mess together 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.829
 almost never talk about the goalkeeper, but we are talking about it 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:43.879
 the keeper 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.290
 and in this way the machine that rolls the steel into manageable 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.369
 plates divided 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:51.369
 then no standing scissors or something like that 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.909
 the grain 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.789
 called grain installation 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:04:00.079
 the on a better and his colleagues nevertheless fulfill one with this installation 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.509
 bit resembles the large chopping knife with which the Sunday braat bar is fair in even 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.089
 large portions 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:09.159
 a very important task 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.069
 they must continuously check whether the steel fund stands for quality 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.779
 remains 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:16.779
 and the measurements up to the knee meter case 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.680
 otherwise it becomes for the following machines in the production process 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.270
 impossible to process it further
