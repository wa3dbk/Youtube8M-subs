hi<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.430> Larry<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:09.330> Gehringer<00:00:09.720> gasifiers

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
hi I'm Larry with Gehringer gasifiers

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.369 
hi I'm Larry with Gehringer gasifiers
and<00:00:11.730> today<00:00:12.450> we're<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> talk<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> little

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
and today we're going to talk a little

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.400 
and today we're going to talk a little
bit<00:00:13.559> about<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.280> liberator<00:00:14.760> gasifier<00:00:15.420> that's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
bit about the liberator gasifier that's

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.830 
bit about the liberator gasifier that's
what<00:00:16.620> this<00:00:16.770> kind<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.580> big<00:00:17.850> black<00:00:18.090> box<00:00:18.420> looking

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
what this kind of big black box looking

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560 
what this kind of big black box looking
thing<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.170> right<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.269> not<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
thing is right here and it's not the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.529 
thing is right here and it's not the
prettiest<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:22.820> but<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.060> does<00:00:24.269> is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
prettiest thing but what it does is

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.620 
prettiest thing but what it does is
pretty<00:00:24.810> amazing<00:00:25.849> it<00:00:26.849> takes<00:00:27.349> it<00:00:28.349> takes<00:00:28.529> wood

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
pretty amazing it takes it takes wood

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.160 
pretty amazing it takes it takes wood
like<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.810> see<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.199> bucket<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:33.170> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
like you see in this bucket here you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110 
like you see in this bucket here you
look<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.730> tree<00:00:36.090> limbs

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
look in here there's some tree limbs

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.920 
look in here there's some tree limbs
I've<00:00:36.510> cut<00:00:36.720> up<00:00:36.980> some<00:00:37.980> melon<00:00:38.370> pieces<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I've cut up some melon pieces here and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.100 
I've cut up some melon pieces here and
you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.110> take<00:00:40.289> this<00:00:40.440> wood<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.750> open<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you can take this wood and you open the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.400 
you can take this wood and you open the
lid<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.590> The<00:00:44.100> Liberator<00:00:45.170> put<00:00:46.170> your<00:00:46.320> wood

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
lid of The Liberator put your wood

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.560 
lid of The Liberator put your wood
inside<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> take<00:00:50.359> you<00:00:51.359> take

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
inside of it and then you take you take

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
inside of it and then you take you take
this<00:00:51.750> wood<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:53.149> you're<00:00:54.149> gonna<00:00:54.270> ignite<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.190> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this wood and you're gonna ignite it to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
this wood and you're gonna ignite it to
this<00:00:56.399> port<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.539> way<00:01:00.690> we

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this port down here and the way we

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.189 
this port down here and the way we
ignite<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:03.390> works<00:01:03.539> best<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.080> me

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
ignite this that works best for me

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.480 
ignite this that works best for me
anyways<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:06.630> use<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.870> MAPE<00:01:07.200> gas<00:01:07.500> torch<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
anyways is I use a MAPE gas torch so I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.450 
anyways is I use a MAPE gas torch so I
turn<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> may<00:01:11.790> pass<00:01:12.030> Church<00:01:12.330> on

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.930 

and<00:01:15.940> then<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.180> light<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.540> through<00:01:16.720> here<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:18.820> not

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
and then I light it through here I'm not

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.570 
and then I light it through here I'm not
gonna<00:01:19.120> light<00:01:19.300> it<00:01:19.420> right<00:01:19.510> now<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.460> want

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
gonna light it right now because I want

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.890 
gonna light it right now because I want
to<00:01:21.670> tell<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.910> a<00:01:21.970> little<00:01:22.060> bit<00:01:22.180> more<00:01:22.420> about<00:01:22.660> how

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
to tell you a little bit more about how

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.490 
to tell you a little bit more about how
this<00:01:23.050> process<00:01:23.320> works<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.900> wood<00:01:26.080> stored

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
this process works see the wood stored

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.410 
this process works see the wood stored
up<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:26.800> here<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.160> this<00:01:27.310> hopper<00:01:27.760> area<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:30.420> then

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
up in here in this hopper area and then

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.680 
up in here in this hopper area and then
it's<00:01:31.600> thermally<00:01:32.380> broken<00:01:32.560> down<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.690> this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
it's thermally broken down in this

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.650 
it's thermally broken down in this
center<00:01:35.140> area<00:01:35.820> we'll<00:01:36.820> just<00:01:37.030> call<00:01:37.240> this<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
center area we'll just call this the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.270 
center area we'll just call this the
reactor<00:01:38.200> section<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.740> ash<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.250> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
reactor section and then the ash in the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.600 
reactor section and then the ash in the
waste<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.390> biochar<00:01:43.990> ends<00:01:44.979> up<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.220> this<00:01:45.369> lower

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
waste the biochar ends up in this lower

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.900 
waste the biochar ends up in this lower
part<00:01:45.880> here<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.950> as<00:01:48.070> it's<00:01:48.369> thermally

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
part here well as it's thermally

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.810 
part here well as it's thermally
decomposed<00:01:50.820> oxygen<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:52.710> pulled<00:01:53.710> in<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.610> this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
decomposed oxygen is pulled in to this

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.280 
decomposed oxygen is pulled in to this
combustion<00:01:55.330> area<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:57.450> during<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.810> process

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
combustion area and during that process

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.040 
combustion area and during that process
there<00:02:02.290> is<00:02:02.530> some<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:04.270> interesting<00:02:04.750> things

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
there is some very interesting things

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.820 
there is some very interesting things
that<00:02:05.440> happen<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.509> gas<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:08.080> broken<00:02:08.470> into

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
that happen the gas is broken into

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.990 
that happen the gas is broken into
several<00:02:09.070> parts<00:02:10.080> where<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.110> get<00:02:11.470> hydrogen<00:02:12.370> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
several parts where you get hydrogen and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.960 
several parts where you get hydrogen and
carbon<00:02:13.570> monoxide<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.560> some<00:02:15.100> Manute<00:02:15.370> nitrogen

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
carbon monoxide and some Manute nitrogen

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.360 
carbon monoxide and some Manute nitrogen
and<00:02:17.100> then<00:02:18.100> what<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.520> do<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:21.250> can

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and then what we can do is we can

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.860 
and then what we can do is we can
actually<00:02:21.790> pull<00:02:22.180> those<00:02:23.110> gases<00:02:23.680> off<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.870> this

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
actually pull those gases off in this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.780 
actually pull those gases off in this
stage<00:02:26.680> here<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.780> pull<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> into<00:02:29.340> our<00:02:30.340> trade

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
stage here and pull it into our trade

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.410 
stage here and pull it into our trade
secretive<00:02:31.980> filtering<00:02:32.980> system<00:02:33.420> which

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
secretive filtering system which

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.380 
secretive filtering system which
actually<00:02:35.280> follows<00:02:36.280> some<00:02:36.850> really<00:02:37.120> interesting

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
actually follows some really interesting

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.410 
actually follows some really interesting
NASA<00:02:37.840> designs<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.790> uses<00:02:40.209> all<00:02:40.390> natural

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
filters that can be just washed out at

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.220 
filters that can be just washed out at
any<00:02:43.420> household<00:02:43.870> sink<00:02:45.450> well<00:02:46.450> then<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.720> gas<00:02:46.959> is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
any household sink well then that gas is

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.729 
any household sink well then that gas is
pulled<00:02:47.530> into<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.190> cooling<00:02:48.489> area<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.440> we<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
pulled into a cooling area so we have to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.190 
pulled into a cooling area so we have to
cool<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.160> gas<00:02:51.340> down<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:52.780> when<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.019> gas

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
cool the gas down because when the gas

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.660 
cool the gas down because when the gas
exits<00:02:54.120> essentially<00:02:55.120> our<00:02:55.500> reactor<00:02:56.500> zone<00:02:56.769> at

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
exits essentially our reactor zone at

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
exits essentially our reactor zone at
1,100<00:02:58.299> degrees<00:02:58.360> Celsius<00:02:59.049> its<00:02:59.709> superheated<00:03:00.690> so

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
1,100 degrees Celsius its superheated so

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.539 
1,100 degrees Celsius its superheated so
it<00:03:01.810> exits<00:03:02.170> at<00:03:02.290> about<00:03:02.500> 200<00:03:03.040> degrees<00:03:03.870> Fahrenheit

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
it exits at about 200 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.090 
it exits at about 200 degrees Fahrenheit
so<00:03:06.549> then<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> gas<00:03:07.030> gets<00:03:07.390> pulled<00:03:08.200> down<00:03:08.320> through

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
so then the gas gets pulled down through

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.920 
so then the gas gets pulled down through
these<00:03:09.250> pipes<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:10.060> these<00:03:10.239> ones<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.840> it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
these pipes and up these ones and it

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.259 
these pipes and up these ones and it
cools<00:03:11.140> off<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.799> condenses<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:15.579> pull<00:03:16.150> the

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
cools off and condenses then we pull the

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.479 
cools off and condenses then we pull the
gas<00:03:16.450> down<00:03:18.150> into<00:03:19.150> our<00:03:19.299> generator<00:03:20.170> here<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:21.310> is

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
gas down into our generator here this is

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.900 
gas down into our generator here this is
a<00:03:21.519> 7,000<00:03:22.450> watt<00:03:22.630> troy<00:03:22.959> bilt<00:03:23.170> generator<00:03:23.910> the

a 7,000 watt troy bilt generator the
only<00:03:25.180> modifications<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.169> we<00:03:26.260> made<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.650> this

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
only modifications that we made to this

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.190 
only modifications that we made to this
generator<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:28.359> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
generator is to the

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
breather housing which allows us to pipe

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.900 
breather housing which allows us to pipe
the<00:03:38.890> gas<00:03:39.069> directly<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.900> carburetor

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
the gas directly in to the carburetor

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.900 
the gas directly in to the carburetor
the<00:03:42.910> fuel<00:03:43.209> line<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.599> totally<00:03:43.810> turned<00:03:44.260> off<00:03:44.440> in

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the fuel line is totally turned off in

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.100 
the fuel line is totally turned off in
fact<00:03:45.910> there's<00:03:46.180> no<00:03:46.330> fuel<00:03:46.599> even<00:03:46.840> in<00:03:46.989> this

fact there's no fuel even in this

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.370 
fact there's no fuel even in this
generator<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:49.269> only<00:03:49.540> other<00:03:49.690> thing<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:49.989> is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
generator the only other thing that is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.910 
generator the only other thing that is
needed<00:03:50.800> is<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.220> premix<00:03:51.940> valve<00:03:52.769> because<00:03:53.769> you

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
needed is this premix valve because you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.850 
needed is this premix valve because you
need<00:03:54.130> oxygen<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.970> combustion<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:56.440> have<00:03:56.650> to

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
need oxygen for combustion we have to

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.630 
need oxygen for combustion we have to
let<00:03:57.069> some<00:03:57.610> ambient<00:03:58.120> air<00:03:58.950> be<00:03:59.950> pulled<00:04:00.220> into<00:04:00.430> our

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
let some ambient air be pulled into our

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.220 
let some ambient air be pulled into our
mixture<00:04:01.349> with<00:04:02.349> this<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.799> this<00:04:02.920> ball<00:04:03.190> valve

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
mixture with this just this ball valve

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.860 
mixture with this just this ball valve
once<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.410> set<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.830> ball<00:04:06.069> valve<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:07.630> can

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
once you set this ball valve and you can

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.300 
once you set this ball valve and you can
pretty<00:04:08.019> much<00:04:08.110> forget<00:04:08.440> about<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:09.010> because<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
pretty much forget about it because the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.069 
pretty much forget about it because the
carburetor<00:04:12.819> will<00:04:13.060> control<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.599> rest<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
carburetor will control the rest of the

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.430 
carburetor will control the rest of the
mix<00:04:14.319> in<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.950> generator<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:16.209> today<00:04:17.109> on<00:04:17.290> this

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
mix in the generator and today on this

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.849 
mix in the generator and today on this
video<00:04:17.739> we're<00:04:18.340> gonna<00:04:18.430> run<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:18.850> chop<00:04:19.120> saw<00:04:19.389> here

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
video we're gonna run this chop saw here

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.440 
video we're gonna run this chop saw here
and<00:04:20.859> we're<00:04:20.950> going<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.160> cut<00:04:21.280> up<00:04:21.400> not<00:04:22.090> just<00:04:22.120> some

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
and we're going to cut up not just some

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.200 
and we're going to cut up not just some
small<00:04:22.570> material<00:04:23.169> with<00:04:23.950> this<00:04:24.100> big<00:04:24.340> 4x4<00:04:24.729> block

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
small material with this big 4x4 block

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.260 
small material with this big 4x4 block
just<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.080> demonstrate<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.860> fact<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.270> this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
just to demonstrate the fact that this

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.040 
just to demonstrate the fact that this
generator<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.810> definitely<00:04:29.169> making<00:04:29.440> power<00:04:31.050> now

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
generator is definitely making power now

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.400 
generator is definitely making power now
to<00:04:32.080> start<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.620> process<00:04:32.919> off<00:04:34.229> we<00:04:35.229> use<00:04:35.380> a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
to start this process off we use a

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.890 
to start this process off we use a
blower<00:04:35.970> there's<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.030> blower<00:04:37.300> inside<00:04:37.750> this

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
blower there's a blower inside this

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.840 
blower there's a blower inside this
housing<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.560> it's<00:04:39.190> plugged<00:04:39.520> into<00:04:40.080> 110<00:04:41.080> volts

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
housing and it's plugged into 110 volts

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.400 
housing and it's plugged into 110 volts
now<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:42.910> can<00:04:43.090> always<00:04:43.270> run<00:04:43.660> this<00:04:43.810> off<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.260> an

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
now you can always run this off of an

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.909 
now you can always run this off of an
inverter<00:04:44.800> off<00:04:45.160> of<00:04:45.490> batteries<00:04:45.669> so<00:04:46.770> then<00:04:47.770> you

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
inverter off of batteries so then you

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.650 
inverter off of batteries so then you
would<00:04:48.039> just<00:04:48.070> provide<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.700> power<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.300> from

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
would just provide the power to it from

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.550 
would just provide the power to it from
batteries<00:04:50.160> versus<00:04:51.539> 110<00:04:52.539> volts<00:04:52.900> today<00:04:53.410> we're

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
batteries versus 110 volts today we're

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.060 
batteries versus 110 volts today we're
going<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.740> use<00:04:53.860> 110<00:04:54.400> volt<00:04:54.610> power<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:56.070> there's

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
going to use 110 volt power and there's

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.940 
going to use 110 volt power and there's
several<00:04:57.340> rheostat<00:04:58.060> controls<00:04:58.510> over<00:04:58.810> here<00:04:59.050> one

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
several rheostat controls over here one

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.370 
several rheostat controls over here one
of<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.130> rheostat<00:05:00.400> controls<00:05:01.139> controls<00:05:02.139> the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
of the rheostat controls controls the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.100 
of the rheostat controls controls the
blower<00:05:02.590> motor<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.880> speed<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:05.740> amount

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.180 

the<00:05:10.110> other<00:05:10.260> control<00:05:11.120> controls<00:05:12.120> Yosh<00:05:12.510> great

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
the other control controls Yosh great

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.450 
the other control controls Yosh great
because<00:05:14.190> we<00:05:14.310> can't<00:05:14.580> have<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:14.940> gas<00:05:16.460> get

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
because we can't have the gas get

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.280 
because we can't have the gas get
clogged<00:05:17.790> up<00:05:18.000> in<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.210> ash<00:05:18.360> great<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.140> we<00:05:19.260> have

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
clogged up in the ash great so we have

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.680 
clogged up in the ash great so we have
an<00:05:19.530> ash<00:05:19.680> grade<00:05:19.950> actuator<00:05:20.490> here<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.270> actually

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
an ash grade actuator here that actually

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.470 
an ash grade actuator here that actually
moves<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.050> great<00:05:22.320> round<00:05:22.590> very<00:05:23.220> slowly<00:05:23.640> maybe

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
moves the great round very slowly maybe

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.440 
moves the great round very slowly maybe
one<00:05:24.810> or<00:05:24.930> two<00:05:25.190> revolutions<00:05:26.190> per<00:05:26.250> minute<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.820> if

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
one or two revolutions per minute and if
