00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hey guys what's up how has it gone so I

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.519 
hey guys what's up how has it gone so I
got<00:00:02.909> some<00:00:03.090> really<00:00:03.449> cool<00:00:03.720> Corey<00:00:04.049> tech<00:00:04.290> for<00:00:04.440> you

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
got some really cool Corey tech for you

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.010 
got some really cool Corey tech for you
guys<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.040> probably<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:06.060> advancement

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
guys this is probably this advancement

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.839 
guys this is probably this advancement
I've<00:00:07.230> made<00:00:07.440> an<00:00:07.589> equerry<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.130> long<00:00:08.370> time<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
I've made an equerry in a long time and

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.600 
I've made an equerry in a long time and
pretty<00:00:09.750> much<00:00:09.870> most<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.530> advancement<00:00:11.280> is

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
pretty much most of this advancement is

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.299 
pretty much most of this advancement is
um<00:00:11.940> actually<00:00:12.929> not<00:00:13.259> mine<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.710> should<00:00:13.920> say<00:00:13.950> that

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
um actually not mine I should say that

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.439 
um actually not mine I should say that
it's<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.610> from<00:00:14.880> Myra<00:00:15.089> nerio<00:00:16.850> he<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.240> released

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
it's a from Myra nerio he just released

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.630 
it's a from Myra nerio he just released
a<00:00:18.570> video<00:00:18.660> I'll<00:00:18.900> link<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.289> its<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.920> best<00:00:20.160> theory

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
a video I'll link to its the best theory

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.759 
a video I'll link to its the best theory
video<00:00:20.880> I've<00:00:21.029> seen<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.480> query<00:00:21.810> yet<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.260> he

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
video I've seen on the query yet and he

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.759 
video I've seen on the query yet and he
showed<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> potential<00:00:23.699> design<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> query

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
showed a potential design for a query

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.980 
showed a potential design for a query
that<00:00:25.769> act<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.510> doesn't<00:00:27.660> deal<00:00:27.869> with

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that act that one it doesn't deal with

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.689 
that act that one it doesn't deal with
the<00:00:28.109> problem<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.529> clocks<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.369> talked

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the problem with clocks that I talked

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.740 
the problem with clocks that I talked
about<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.970> my<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.660> Corey<00:00:31.410> problem<00:00:32.130> video<00:00:32.750> yes

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
about in my like Corey problem video yes

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.770 
about in my like Corey problem video yes
I'm<00:00:34.050> aware<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.829> weeks<00:00:34.980> ago<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.780> there's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I'm aware that two weeks ago I there's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.970 
I'm aware that two weeks ago I there's
something<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> put<00:00:37.680> out<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.800> video

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
something like that I put out a video

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
something like that I put out a video
saying<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.430> was<00:00:38.520> done<00:00:38.910> working<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> quarry

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
saying I was done working on the quarry

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.010 
saying I was done working on the quarry
and<00:00:40.100> here<00:00:41.100> i'm<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> quarry<00:00:41.700> again<00:00:42.020> yeah

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and here i'm at the quarry again yeah

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.940 
and here i'm at the quarry again yeah
but<00:00:44.629> yeah<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.140> design<00:00:46.590> should<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
but yeah this this design should make it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
but yeah this this design should make it
working<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.930> should<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.320> able

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
working actually just you should be able

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
working actually just you should be able
to<00:00:49.590> unload<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> world<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.760> design

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to unload the world now in this design

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.850 
to unload the world now in this design
you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.750> turn<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.170> design<00:00:52.500> off<00:00:52.649> easily

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
you can turn this design off easily

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.819 
you can turn this design off easily
basically<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.199> don't<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.680> any

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
basically and you don't have to have any

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
basically and you don't have to have any
clocks<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.280> anything<00:00:56.610> running<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.270> no

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
clocks or anything running with it no

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.740 
clocks or anything running with it no
problems<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.460> anyway<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.820> um<00:01:00.000> he

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
problems like that anyway so what um he

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
problems like that anyway so what um he
just<00:01:00.780> kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> showed<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.789> skeleton<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
just kind of showed the skeleton of this

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
just kind of showed the skeleton of this
thing<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.559> an<00:01:04.739> actual<00:01:05.159> working<00:01:05.460> version

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
thing but not an actual working version

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
thing but not an actual working version
like<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> move<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> machines<00:01:07.680> by

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
like you have to move the machines by

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.179 
like you have to move the machines by
hand<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.630> he<00:01:09.720> showed<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:11.070> now

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
hand just in what he showed and from now

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.590 
hand just in what he showed and from now
now<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:11.970> probably<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.450> be

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
now and I'm probably just gonna be

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570 
now and I'm probably just gonna be
calling<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> Myron<00:01:13.439> query<00:01:13.890> design<00:01:14.430> just

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
calling this the Myron query design just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
calling this the Myron query design just
because<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.290> has<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.710> named

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
because it this it just has to be named

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.120 
because it this it just has to be named
after<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.340> guy<00:01:17.430> he's<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:19.200> stuff<00:01:19.470> about

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
after this guy he's this stuff about

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.880 
after this guy he's this stuff about
queries<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> he's<00:01:20.759> done<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.210> amazing

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
queries that he's done it's just amazing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.910 
queries that he's done it's just amazing
okay<00:01:22.890> anyways<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.659> what<00:01:24.659> I've<00:01:24.750> done<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
okay anyways and what I've done is a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.480 
okay anyways and what I've done is a
half<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> bringing<00:01:26.930> an<00:01:27.979> arbitrary<00:01:28.979> row

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
half a way of bringing an arbitrary row

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
half a way of bringing an arbitrary row
of<00:01:29.610> blocks<00:01:29.909> from<00:01:30.450> anywhere<00:01:30.840> along<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.259> wall

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
of blocks from anywhere along this wall

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.149 
of blocks from anywhere along this wall
here<00:01:32.420> bringing<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.689> entire<00:01:33.780> row<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.860> fixed

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
here bringing the entire row to a fixed

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.649 
here bringing the entire row to a fixed
exposition<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.460> fixed<00:01:38.759> y<00:01:39.030> position<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
exposition and a fixed y position a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.819 
exposition and a fixed y position a
fixed<00:01:39.900> height<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.409> what<00:01:43.409> needs<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> done

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
fixed height so what needs to be done

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.530 
fixed height so what needs to be done
still<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.460> able<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.729> move<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.479> forward

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
still be able to move this thing forward

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240 
still be able to move this thing forward
this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> machine<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.710> kind<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.040> pics

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this is the machine that kind of pics

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
this is the machine that kind of pics
off<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> row<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> wall<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.630> then

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
off a row from the wall here and then

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.840 
off a row from the wall here and then
well<00:01:49.590> I'll<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.070> run<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.310> thing<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.579> explain

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
well I'll just run this thing at explain

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.310 
well I'll just run this thing at explain
as<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:52.399> all<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
as I go all right this this is the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.480 
as I go all right this this is the
second<00:01:55.680> time<00:01:55.770> trying<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.130> film<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.369> video

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
second time trying to film this video

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
second time trying to film this video
because<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.149> first<00:01:57.420> time<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.750> forgot<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
because the first time I forgot to have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.510 
because the first time I forgot to have
one<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.619> sitting<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:58.950> Stoppers<00:01:59.369> in

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
one of this up sitting in Stoppers in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
one of this up sitting in Stoppers in
there<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.270> these<00:02:00.659> things<00:02:00.869> ran<00:02:01.049> into<00:02:01.290> each

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
there and the these things ran into each

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.190 
there and the these things ran into each
other<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.430> should<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.640> good<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.140> anyway<00:02:04.140> so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
other it should be good now anyway so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.670 
other it should be good now anyway so
this<00:02:04.409> single<00:02:04.740> fly<00:02:05.430> by<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.290> my<00:02:07.409> wallet

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
this single fly by this is my wallet

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.600 
this single fly by this is my wallet
your<00:02:07.890> modified<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> little

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
your modified a little

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.780 
your modified a little
and<00:02:09.729> it'll<00:02:10.119> pick<00:02:10.420> up<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.460> rows<00:02:12.610> of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and it'll pick up one of the rows of

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.060 
and it'll pick up one of the rows of
blocks<00:02:13.030> some<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.020> their<00:02:14.140> sums<00:02:14.440> there's<00:02:14.920> some

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
blocks some of their sums there's some

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.400 
blocks some of their sums there's some
graphical<00:02:15.490> leg<00:02:15.670> but<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.150> should<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:17.020> working

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
graphical leg but it should be working

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.730 
graphical leg but it should be working
fully<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.330> now<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.540> stops<00:02:19.810> here<00:02:20.020> then<00:02:20.620> we're

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
fully so now it stops here then we're

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.990 
fully so now it stops here then we're
going<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.890> send<00:02:21.070> over<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> second<00:02:21.700> why<00:02:21.820> later

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
going to send over the second why later

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 
going to send over the second why later
and<00:02:22.300> this<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:22.840> all<00:02:23.350> it's<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.770> do<00:02:23.890> is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
and this one all it's going to do is

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.610 
and this one all it's going to do is
sort<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.310> um<00:02:25.350> pick<00:02:26.350> up<00:02:26.560> these<00:02:27.160> blocks<00:02:28.620> from

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
sort of um pick up these blocks from

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.620 
sort of um pick up these blocks from
this<00:02:30.250> wall<00:02:30.520> later<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.240> kind<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.510> like

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
this wall later so this is kind of like

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.650 
this wall later so this is kind of like
the<00:02:31.690> retrieval<00:02:32.380> wall<00:02:32.560> wieder<00:02:33.330> cocl<00:02:34.330> stop

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the retrieval wall wieder cocl stop

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.590 
the retrieval wall wieder cocl stop
there<00:02:34.900> pick<00:02:35.680> up<00:02:35.830> all<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> blocks<00:02:36.340> without<00:02:37.120> any

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
there pick up all the blocks without any

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.560 
there pick up all the blocks without any
of<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> slime<00:02:38.230> blocks<00:02:38.890> touching<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:40.300> got

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
of the slime blocks touching so this got

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.140 
of the slime blocks touching so this got
pretty<00:02:40.959> close<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:42.459> having<00:02:42.610> some<00:02:42.880> spatial

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
pretty close to having some spatial

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.900 
pretty close to having some spatial
problems<00:02:43.630> here<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.320> works<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.910> then

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
problems here but so it works and then

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.220 
problems here but so it works and then
now<00:02:46.150> we're<00:02:46.450> going<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.600> send<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:46.900> thing<00:02:47.050> and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
now we're going to send this thing and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.870 
now we're going to send this thing and
this<00:02:47.350> is<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.739> real<00:02:47.950> thing<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.550> want<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> show

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
this is the real thing I want to show

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.400 
this is the real thing I want to show
you<00:02:49.000> guys<00:02:49.090> over<00:02:49.480> there<00:02:49.600> that's<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.230> thing

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
you guys over there that's the thing

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.220 
you guys over there that's the thing
that<00:02:50.560> took<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.800> most<00:02:50.950> time<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.020> over

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
that took the most time so this over

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.160 
that took the most time so this over
here<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:55.000> may<00:02:55.209> take<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.450> second<00:02:55.840> but<00:02:55.959> this

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
here this may take a second but this

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.320 
here this may take a second but this
thing<00:02:56.440> will<00:02:57.310> take<00:02:57.640> all<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.570> blocks<00:02:58.930> off<00:03:00.330> this

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
thing will take all the blocks off this

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.210 
thing will take all the blocks off this
wall<00:03:01.570> lighter<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.020> rather<00:03:02.560> than<00:03:02.620> bring<00:03:03.070> them

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
wall lighter and rather than bring them

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.050 
wall lighter and rather than bring them
to<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> fixed<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.709> fixed<00:03:05.709> point<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:06.160> here<00:03:06.190> and

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
to a fixed a fixed point up here and

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.760 
to a fixed a fixed point up here and
then<00:03:07.209> ideally<00:03:07.480> we'd<00:03:07.780> have<00:03:07.930> with<00:03:08.200> our<00:03:08.230> cages<00:03:08.620> up

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
then ideally we'd have with our cages up

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.490 
then ideally we'd have with our cages up
here<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.630> don't<00:03:11.110> run<00:03:11.350> into

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
here but just so that I don't run into

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.870 
here but just so that I don't run into
any<00:03:11.590> problems<00:03:11.800> with<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.250> withers<00:03:12.459> destroying

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
any problems with the withers destroying

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.220 
any problems with the withers destroying
stuff<00:03:13.120> i<00:03:13.239> just<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.510> command<00:03:13.810> blocks<00:03:14.049> because

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
stuff i just have command blocks because

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.930 
stuff i just have command blocks because
i<00:03:14.560> know<00:03:14.769> how<00:03:14.890> come<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.190> walks<00:03:15.400> work<00:03:15.580> but<00:03:15.910> i

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
i know how come and walks work but i

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.039 
i know how come and walks work but i
don't<00:03:16.150> know<00:03:16.180> how<00:03:16.299> weathers<00:03:16.600> work<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.600> is

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
don't know how weathers work and this is

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.229 
don't know how weathers work and this is
a<00:03:20.410> fully<00:03:20.950> automatic<00:03:21.280> system<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:21.850> thing<00:03:22.030> will

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
a fully automatic system this thing will

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.509 
a fully automatic system this thing will
detect<00:03:22.720> this<00:03:22.930> stop<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.470> take<00:03:24.070> all<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.310> blocks

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
detect this stop it take all the blocks

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.250 
detect this stop it take all the blocks
off<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.880> send<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.330> flying<00:03:25.720> machine<00:03:25.840> back

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
off and send this flying machine back

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.259 
off and send this flying machine back
out<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:27.870> successfully<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.670> another<00:03:30.670> just

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
block then the query would be turned off

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.710 
block then the query would be turned off
but<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.500> don't<00:03:39.040> want<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> query<00:03:39.489> off<00:03:39.600> all<00:03:40.600> right

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
but I don't want the query off all right

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.960 
but I don't want the query off all right
so<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:40.930> flies<00:03:41.140> in<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:42.040> will<00:03:42.160> get<00:03:42.280> detected<00:03:42.760> over

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
so it flies in it will get detected over

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.020 
so it flies in it will get detected over
there<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.830> now<00:03:44.980> I'll<00:03:45.160> watch<00:03:45.340> over<00:03:45.549> here<00:03:45.880> so

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
there and now I'll watch over here so

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.070 
there and now I'll watch over here so
you<00:03:46.060> can<00:03:46.239> see<00:03:46.390> how<00:03:46.420> these<00:03:46.630> blocks<00:03:46.930> are

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
you can see how these blocks are

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.970 
you can see how these blocks are
retrieved

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.920 

that's<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.100> kin<00:03:52.340> Tuffle<00:03:52.760> piston<00:03:53.360> extender<00:03:53.450> that

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that's a kin Tuffle piston extender that

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.630 
that's a kin Tuffle piston extender that
was<00:03:54.230> probably<00:03:54.590> took<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.010> must<00:03:55.190> work<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.430> this

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
was probably took the must work in this

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.370 
was probably took the must work in this
thing<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.510> now<00:03:56.660> we<00:03:56.720> have<00:03:56.810> some<00:03:57.080> conveyor

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
thing and now we have some conveyor

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.700 
thing and now we have some conveyor
belts<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.770> push<00:03:57.980> all<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.220> blocks<00:03:58.430> up<00:03:58.610> and

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
belts that push all the blocks up and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.230 
belts that push all the blocks up and
they're<00:04:00.710> just<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.430> lead<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.760> buy<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:01.910> command

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
they're just the lead to buy the command

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.920 
they're just the lead to buy the command
blocks<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.970> clock<00:04:05.210> will<00:04:05.390> run<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.780> little

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
blocks that clock will run for a little

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.260 
blocks that clock will run for a little
while<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.250> circuitry<00:04:07.670> for<00:04:07.760> this<00:04:08.030> clock

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
while all the circuitry for this clock

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.110 
while all the circuitry for this clock
is<00:04:08.480> down<00:04:09.140> here<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:10.040> then<00:04:10.580> once<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.910> clocks

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
is down here and then once the clocks

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.600 
is down here and then once the clocks
finish<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:12.380> will<00:04:12.530> send<00:04:12.800> this<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.310> will<00:04:13.400> send

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
finish it will send this it will send

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.199 
finish it will send this it will send
the<00:04:13.700> whole<00:04:13.820> thing<00:04:14.060> back<00:04:14.270> off<00:04:14.450> on<00:04:14.630> its<00:04:14.780> way<00:04:14.900> and

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
the whole thing back off on its way and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.140 
the whole thing back off on its way and
there<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.300> go<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:17.690> that's<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.970> guess<00:04:19.970> we'll

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
there you go so that's a I guess we'll

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.680 
there you go so that's a I guess we'll
eat<00:04:20.330> our<00:04:20.360> unloader<00:04:20.780> thing<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:23.090> just<00:04:23.540> send

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
eat our unloader thing so just send

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.790 
eat our unloader thing so just send
their<00:04:23.780> step<00:04:23.930> in<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.110> quarry<00:04:24.290> I'll<00:04:24.530> show<00:04:24.740> you

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
their step in the quarry I'll show you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.350 
their step in the quarry I'll show you
guys<00:04:24.950> if<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.730> guys<00:04:25.760> enjoyed<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.210> yeah<00:04:26.810> I

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
guys if you guys enjoyed and yeah I

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.360 
guys if you guys enjoyed and yeah I
would<00:04:29.360> like<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.660> have<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.380> fully<00:04:30.800> working

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
would like to have a fully working

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.930 
would like to have a fully working
quarry<00:04:31.970> within<00:04:33.310> within<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.370> month<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.730> think

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
quarry within within a month I think

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.740 
quarry within within a month I think
should<00:04:35.300> be<00:04:35.420> possible<00:04:37.210> not<00:04:38.210> too<00:04:38.390> much<00:04:38.510> more

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
should be possible not too much more

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.970 
should be possible not too much more
needs<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.050> be<00:04:39.110> done<00:04:39.200> so<00:04:39.500> i'll<00:04:39.590> probably<00:04:39.830> just

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
needs to be done so i'll probably just

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.440 
needs to be done so i'll probably just
make<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.280> video<00:04:40.520> every<00:04:40.880> now<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.120> then<00:04:41.210> whenever

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
make a video every now and then whenever

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.560 
make a video every now and then whenever
I've<00:04:41.860> finished<00:04:42.860> some<00:04:43.370> new<00:04:43.610> part<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.150> it<00:04:44.270> and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.390 

okay<00:04:47.570> there<00:04:47.720> we<00:04:47.780> go<00:04:47.890> every<00:04:48.890> time<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.190> see<00:04:49.370> it

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
okay there we go every time I see it

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.040 
okay there we go every time I see it
like<00:04:49.700> stopped<00:04:50.060> because<00:04:50.450> of<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.630> graphical

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
like stopped because of the graphical

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.050 
like stopped because of the graphical
like<00:04:51.200> I<00:04:51.320> worry<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.800> broke<00:04:51.950> but<00:04:52.220> yeah<00:04:52.910> and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
like I worry that it broke but yeah and

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.060 
like I worry that it broke but yeah and
then<00:04:53.210> I'll<00:04:53.840> put<00:04:54.170> out<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.290> world<00:04:54.560> download<00:04:54.800> or

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
then I'll put out a world download or

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.830 
then I'll put out a world download or
something<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.550> give<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.480> really

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
something and just give a really
