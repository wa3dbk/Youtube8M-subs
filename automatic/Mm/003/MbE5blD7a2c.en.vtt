some of it wasn't caught on camera a lot
of<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.970> really<00:01:13.360> up<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.720> air<00:01:13.900> with<00:01:14.049> how

you're<00:01:14.350> going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.560> do<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.190> put<00:01:16.119> some<00:01:16.300> wood

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
you're going to do it so put some wood

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.370 
you're going to do it so put some wood
on<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.659> front<00:01:16.900> end<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.310> in<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.909> wood<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
on the front end and in the wood you

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.960 
on the front end and in the wood you
know<00:01:20.470> there's<00:01:20.710> always<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:21.400> question<00:01:21.610> of<00:01:21.880> how

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
know there's always this question of how

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.640 
know there's always this question of how
people<00:01:22.030> are<00:01:22.360> going<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.630> slide<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.170> doors<00:01:23.380> back

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
people are going to slide the doors back

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.770 
people are going to slide the doors back
and<00:01:23.860> forth<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.369> in<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:24.580> case<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:25.060> just<00:01:25.630> made<00:01:25.750> a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
and forth so in this case I just made a

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.770 
and forth so in this case I just made a
couple<00:01:26.320> of<00:01:26.409> cuts<00:01:26.649> in<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.340> wood<00:01:27.520> for<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.570> door

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
couple of cuts in the wood for the door

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.600 
couple of cuts in the wood for the door
to<00:01:28.810> slide<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.830> same<00:01:30.009> on<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.190> top<00:01:30.250> same

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
to slide on so the same on the top same

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.430 
to slide on so the same on the top same
on<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.790> bottom<00:01:30.909> right<00:01:31.869> now<00:01:31.899> we<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.290> have<00:01:32.409> a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
on the bottom right now we just have a

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.530 
on the bottom right now we just have a
stop<00:01:32.860> here<00:01:33.190> but<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.759> does<00:01:34.030> leave<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> gap

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
stop here but that it does leave a gap

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.420 
stop here but that it does leave a gap
here<00:01:34.869> that<00:01:35.050> we're<00:01:35.560> going<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.740> have<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.040> fill<00:01:36.280> up

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
here that we're going to have to fill up

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.389 
here that we're going to have to fill up
at<00:01:36.610> some<00:01:36.940> point<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:38.200> other<00:01:38.320> thing<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.950> on<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
at some point the other thing is on the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.840 
at some point the other thing is on the
inside<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.200> went<00:01:41.350> with<00:01:41.440> events<00:01:41.950> that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
inside we just went with events that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.419 
inside we just went with events that
were<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.649> soffit<00:01:44.649> covers<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.250> saw

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
were the soffit covers that we saw

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:52.070 
were the soffit covers that we saw
before<00:01:47.250> put<00:01:48.250> one<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.670> either<00:01:49.660> side<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.759> then

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
before put one on either side and then

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.300 
before put one on either side and then
what<00:01:53.080> will<00:01:53.229> eventually<00:01:53.770> be<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.070> lights

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
what will eventually be the lights

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.100 
what will eventually be the lights
there's<00:01:54.640> absolutely<00:01:55.240> nothing<00:01:55.509> wired<00:01:55.899> in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
there's absolutely nothing wired in

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.109 
there's absolutely nothing wired in
there<00:01:56.259> right<00:01:56.440> now<00:01:56.550> it's<00:01:57.550> just<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.910> pieces

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
there right now it's just the pieces

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.880 
there right now it's just the pieces
that<00:01:58.899> are<00:01:59.020> connected<00:02:00.539> up<00:02:01.539> here<00:02:01.899> do<00:02:02.530> nothing

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
that are connected up here do nothing

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.169 
that are connected up here do nothing
but<00:02:03.070> eventually<00:02:03.310> there'll<00:02:03.610> be<00:02:03.640> some<00:02:03.880> cords

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
but eventually there'll be some cords

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.040 
but eventually there'll be some cords
coming<00:02:04.420> out<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.690> there

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
coming out of there

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.279 
coming out of there
so<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:06.310> shaping<00:02:06.610> up<00:02:06.789> it's<00:02:07.090> closer<00:02:07.509> than<00:02:07.899> it

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
so it's shaping up it's closer than it

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.759 
so it's shaping up it's closer than it
was<00:02:09.330> almost<00:02:10.330> there<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:14.110> then<00:02:14.290> I'm<00:02:14.410> left<00:02:14.590> with

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
was almost there so then I'm left with

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.470 
was almost there so then I'm left with
the<00:02:14.890> moment<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.519> least<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.940> life<00:02:16.090> which<00:02:16.329> is

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the moment I like least in life which is

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.930 
the moment I like least in life which is
dealing<00:02:16.660> with<00:02:16.780> electricity<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.190> have<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
dealing with electricity so I have a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.300 
dealing with electricity so I have a
couple<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.329> extension<00:02:19.840> cords<00:02:20.100> poking<00:02:21.100> through

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
couple of extension cords poking through

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.130 
couple of extension cords poking through
from<00:02:21.579> the<00:02:21.670> other<00:02:21.700> end<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.269> got<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.900> hook<00:02:23.019> up

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
from the other end just got to hook up

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.990 
from the other end just got to hook up
the<00:02:23.260> ground<00:02:23.470> wires<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:24.070> all<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> connections

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the ground wires get all the connections

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.060 
the ground wires get all the connections
connected<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.600> then<00:02:25.720> see<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.560> there<00:02:26.799> will<00:02:27.010> be

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
connected and then see if there will be

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.130 
connected and then see if there will be
light

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.970
