myself but I've been remembering the air

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
myself but I've been remembering the air
as<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> made<00:00:50.910> last<00:00:51.149> year<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:52.050> cost<00:00:52.350> me

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
as I made last year which which cost me

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
as I made last year which which cost me
second<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.399> third<00:00:53.579> place<00:00:53.789> by<00:00:54.270> running<00:00:54.600> off<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.380 
second or third place by running off the
road<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:56.280> bike<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.670> still<00:00:56.879> getting<00:00:56.969> used<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
road this bike I'm still getting used to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.250 
road this bike I'm still getting used to
it<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.160> just<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.309> handful<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.789> power<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.510> it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it it's just a handful of power and it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.979 
it it's just a handful of power and it's
they're<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.890> small<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> margin<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.480> error<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
they're so small a margin for error on a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.530 
they're so small a margin for error on a
bike<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:05.460> capable<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
bike like this it's capable of going a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.630 
bike like this it's capable of going a
lot<00:01:06.659> faster<00:01:06.900> than<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.380> capable<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:08.010> handling

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
lot faster than I'm capable of handling

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.300 
lot faster than I'm capable of handling
it<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.510> by<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:10.170> riding<00:01:10.439> smoother<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it but by actually riding smoother and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.820 
it but by actually riding smoother and
in<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:11.970> head<00:01:12.150> trying<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.600> ride<00:01:12.810> slower<00:01:13.229> my

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
in my head trying to ride slower my

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
in my head trying to ride slower my
times<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.220> actually<00:01:14.369> faster<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.450> i'm

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
times are actually faster because i'm

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.149 
times are actually faster because i'm
using<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> machine<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:16.950> way

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
using more of the machine the right way

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
using more of the machine the right way
and<00:01:17.189> whether<00:01:17.970> i<00:01:18.060> win<00:01:18.420> lose<00:01:18.659> or<00:01:18.689> draw<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.380> long

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and whether i win lose or draw so long

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.140 
and whether i win lose or draw so long
as<00:01:19.650> i<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> top<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.030> i'm

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
as i get to the top but that's what i'm

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
as i get to the top but that's what i'm
doing<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.750> race<00:01:22.320> day<00:01:22.560> i'll<00:01:22.770> let<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.189> hang<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
doing so race day i'll let it hang out a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
doing so race day i'll let it hang out a
little<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.509> still<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> keep

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
little bit more but still going to keep

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
little bit more but still going to keep
it<00:01:25.860> down<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> 99<00:01:26.520> percent<00:01:26.909> last<00:01:27.119> year<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.570> at

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
102 percent you know the bottom part is
really<00:01:32.009> great<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.610> pavement<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.240> below<00:01:33.509> was

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
the middle section they put the calcium

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.250 
the middle section they put the calcium
carbonate<00:01:38.760> down<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:39.990> really

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
carbonate down and and it was really

and there's a lot of big rocks sticking
up<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:52.080> favorite<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.490> middle<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.180> w's<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
up my favorite is the middle the w's and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.890 
up my favorite is the middle the w's and
the<00:01:55.440> bottom<00:01:55.800> section<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.150> fun<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.750> like

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
the bottom section it's all fun I like

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.740 
the bottom section it's all fun I like
all<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.230> it<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.800> bottom<00:01:59.130> section<00:01:59.550> is<00:01:59.750> such

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
high speed and and I consider it the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.030 
high speed and and I consider it the
most<00:02:02.970> dangerous<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.620> of<00:02:05.010> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
most dangerous just because of the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.250 
most dangerous just because of the
speeds<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> carry<00:02:06.090> off<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> bat<00:02:06.750> I'm

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
speeds that you carry off the bat I'm

off<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:17.010> small<00:03:17.220> box<00:03:17.459> Chevy<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.720> bike<00:03:18.870> used<00:03:19.110> to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
off a small box Chevy the bike used to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.170 
off a small box Chevy the bike used to
breathe<00:03:19.440> through<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.680> hole<00:03:19.890> about<00:03:20.100> four<00:03:20.940> inches

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
breathe through a hole about four inches

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.960 
breathe through a hole about four inches
square<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.810> now<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.620> got<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.770> great<00:03:23.010> big<00:03:23.459> KN

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
square and now it's got a great big KN

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.850 
square and now it's got a great big KN
to<00:03:24.090> breathe<00:03:24.300> through<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.200> actually<00:03:25.530> picked

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
to breathe through so I actually picked

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.580 
to breathe through so I actually picked
up<00:03:25.980> 15<00:03:26.370> horsepower<00:03:26.700> by<00:03:27.600> doing<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.470> about

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
up 15 horsepower by doing that in about

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.770 
up 15 horsepower by doing that in about
10<00:03:28.920> foot<00:03:29.100> pounds<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.489> torque<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.910> obviously

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
10 foot pounds of torque and obviously
