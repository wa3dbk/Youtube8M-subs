about it more in video one now here is

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.319 
about it more in video one now here is
an<00:03:01.079> on/off<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.159> then<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.669> have<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.879> viewing

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
an on/off and then you have a viewing

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.599 
an on/off and then you have a viewing
window<00:03:03.359> here<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.769> like<00:03:04.919> a<00:03:04.949> sliding

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
window here and this is like a sliding

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.720 
window here and this is like a sliding
mechanism<00:03:06.000> which<00:03:06.959> gets<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.409> tray<00:03:07.680> back<00:03:08.669> into

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
mechanism which gets the tray back into

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.729 
mechanism which gets the tray back into
the<00:03:09.000> baking<00:03:09.389> position<00:03:09.870> then<00:03:10.169> in<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.409> warming

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
the baking position then in the warming

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.439 
the baking position then in the warming
position<00:03:11.189> and<00:03:11.370> then<00:03:11.699> you<00:03:11.790> can<00:03:11.939> take<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.209> out

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:12.449 
position and then you can take it out

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:14.000 
position and then you can take it out
here<00:03:12.629> which<00:03:12.780> makes<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.139> a<00:03:13.230> unique<00:03:13.500> oven<00:03:13.859> now

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
here which makes it a unique oven now

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.559 
here which makes it a unique oven now
I've<00:03:14.219> probably<00:03:14.549> done<00:03:15.919> maybe<00:03:16.919> 15<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.090> 18

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
I've probably done maybe 15 to 18

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.210 
I've probably done maybe 15 to 18
different<00:03:18.810> kids<00:03:19.259> oven<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:19.769> that's<00:03:19.949> a<00:03:20.040> unique
