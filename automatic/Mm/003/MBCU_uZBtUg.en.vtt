know in poker deuces are wild that means

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.620 
know in poker deuces are wild that means
that<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> deuce<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.860> represent<00:03:02.220> any<00:03:02.550> card<00:03:03.240> it

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
that a deuce can represent any card it

that a deuce can represent any card it
can<00:03:04.170> represent<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:09.480> 9<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.690> diamonds<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.750> I

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
can represent the 9 of diamonds but if I

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.200 
can represent the 9 of diamonds but if I
take<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> deuce<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.770> rub<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.070> against<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.700> 9<00:03:14.940> it

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
take a deuce and rub it against a 9 it

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.330 
take a deuce and rub it against a 9 it
starts<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.720> resemble<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.500> 9<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.950> diamonds

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
starts to resemble the 9 of diamonds

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.210 
starts to resemble the 9 of diamonds
look<00:03:18.180> I'll<00:03:18.300> trap<00:03:18.600> adduce<00:03:18.900> between<00:03:19.410> two<00:03:19.710> 9s

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
look I'll trap adduce between two 9s

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.580 
look I'll trap adduce between two 9s
when<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.640> twist<00:03:21.240> that's<00:03:21.900> when<00:03:22.110> i'm<00:03:22.230> left<00:03:22.440> with

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
when I twist that's when i'm left with

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.380 
when I twist that's when i'm left with
nothing<00:03:23.150> but<00:03:24.150> nines<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:26.790> next<00:03:27.060> tues<00:03:27.240> I'll

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
nothing but nines this next tues I'll

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.970 
nothing but nines this next tues I'll
handle<00:03:27.630> very<00:03:27.840> slowly<00:03:28.140> because<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.530> know<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.860> can

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
handle very slowly because I know it can

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.780 
handle very slowly because I know it can
be<00:03:29.010> confusing<00:03:29.810> confuses<00:03:30.810> me<00:03:30.990> sometimes

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
be confusing confuses me sometimes

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.100 
be confusing confuses me sometimes
naturally<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.880> hasn't<00:03:33.330> changed<00:03:33.390> yet<00:03:33.810> because

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
naturally it hasn't changed yet because

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.990 
naturally it hasn't changed yet because
I<00:03:34.200> haven't<00:03:34.350> rubbed<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:35.010> only<00:03:35.280> when<00:03:35.460> i<00:03:35.490> rub

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
I haven't rubbed it's only when i rub

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.710 
I haven't rubbed it's only when i rub
that<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.810> changes<00:03:37.500> as<00:03:38.030> have<00:03:39.030> these<00:03:39.360> other

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that it changes as have these other

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.980 
that it changes as have these other
three<00:03:40.080> cards<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:42.000> next<00:03:42.330> deuce<00:03:42.720> i'm

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
three cards and this next deuce i'm

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.560 
three cards and this next deuce i'm
going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.620> leave<00:03:43.860> jutting<00:03:44.640> out<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.000> center

because that way you can't suspect

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.950 
because that way you can't suspect
sleight<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.500> hand<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.280> I'm<00:03:50.880> not<00:03:51.300> even<00:03:51.690> touching

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
know I can change these cards not only

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.180 
know I can change these cards not only
one<00:04:21.870> at<00:04:22.020> a<00:04:22.080> time<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.940> can<00:04:23.940> even<00:04:24.210> change<00:04:24.510> them<00:04:25.190> two

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
one at a time I can even change them two

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.100 
one at a time I can even change them two
at<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.400> time<00:04:26.430> because<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:27.300> take<00:04:27.540> two<00:04:27.840> deuces

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
at a time because I can take two deuces

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.330 
at a time because I can take two deuces
at<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:29.280> same<00:04:29.580> time<00:04:30.000> face<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.840> face<00:04:31.350> if<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:32.010> do

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
at the same time face to face if you do

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.810 
at the same time face to face if you do
two<00:04:32.640> at<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.850> time<00:04:33.050> face<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.080> face<00:04:34.650> it's<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.550> little

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
two at a time face to face it's a little

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.720 
two at a time face to face it's a little
different<00:04:36.030> because<00:04:36.360> if<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.590> rub<00:04:38.010> they<00:04:38.340> will

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
different because if I rub they will

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.200 
different because if I rub they will
change<00:04:40.370> there's<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.460> delay<00:04:41.850> but<00:04:42.330> eventually

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
change there's a delay but eventually

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:52.820 
change there's a delay but eventually
they<00:04:45.210> change<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:51.260> don't<00:04:52.260> think<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.500> thought<00:04:52.680> that

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
they change I don't think I thought that

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.720 
they change I don't think I thought that
laughing<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.310> going<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.550> watch<00:04:53.730> this<00:04:53.970> one<00:04:54.210> dope

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
so that I began with a single nine and

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.400 
so that I began with a single nine and
eight<00:05:01.500> deuces<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.070> I<00:05:02.280> end<00:05:02.460> with<00:05:02.580> nine<00:05:03.410> nines

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
eight deuces and I end with nine nines

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:18.700 
eight deuces and I end with nine nines
and<00:05:05.010> that's<00:05:05.610> why<00:05:06.260> deuces<00:05:07.260> are<00:05:07.500> wild
