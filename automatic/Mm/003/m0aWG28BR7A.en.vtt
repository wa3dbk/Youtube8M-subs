00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.830
 Hello a little bit of English 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.469
 between quotation marks 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.889
 and I got there and did not understand anything that mediated take me much less understood 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.249
 what of what I said what I was trying to say 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.710
 Dawn complicated me a lot the things that this is going to apply only in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.960
 South Africa yesterday granted more functions 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.480
 then English is the official celebration English 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.020
 So the main one 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.650
 but a quintero for example then yes yes the person with whom I am 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.920
 speaking from the sulú tribe 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.420
 then they have access to more than 300 from things from another city of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.880
 cádiz in the enclosures 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.590
 then without agreement they have signed this same posture of the psn 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 in a very famous store and the man who attended me indie opera 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 while giving with the accent indicated that it is very particular very very camping 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.450
 and then like I took the tour they announce themselves for these tasks 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.310
 and this is the same as the hotel in that of that 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.380
 and I started talking with the accent that the government bought 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.730
 for being a strike 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.950
 Well, as I speak English, it's not 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.270
 then if the Africans have miguel make songs a very impulsive language 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.290
 milan to german then the english they speak is very well as very 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.380
 abrupt 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.430
 then with them communication was much more difficult but lucas 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.020
 Thursday with the entrance to a problem of surcharge colon but by the pro in 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.200
 Sudan in Ethiopia Milan ardennes in Pakistan for example even in India 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.180
 who are supposed to speak so much English 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 and so 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.670
 for example to get to the site leisure I had soul paquillo I showed them Brazil 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.460
 itagüí 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 we still very weak 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.950
 of them until they understood ponders that it leads well be called the right 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.260
 a day later the skier made the seal for eight months but yes 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.259
 in other parts 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.879
 e the accident was strong 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.700
 i the motorbike to a motorcycle came out 2 3 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 i in the kilometer where only two other bird tickets that also then 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:22.999
 efe on the one hand 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.809
 of that worried for the report I thought that life was shattered 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:33.869
 On the other hand, another team could not move their innocence so much. 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:38.679
 simao boots all over the race aquino hip fracture 3 are three or 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.449
 four months then 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.439
 additional all day 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.479
 but it seems like the minute zero before 5 minutes 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.729
 I presented 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.709
 that according to limited but already after 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.859
 I was raised percent 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.219
 can walk 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.310
 I had no fracture at all 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.579
 i after the last edition 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.139
 Johnson complicated because there was nothing and it was my turn to just remove it 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.439
 manifested 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.760
 but the pair of them is a very cloudy man 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.219
 on the road and she alone 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.779
 all that was crushed by its high part the motorcycle that the use of the gps its 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.929
 Peter's successor all these deadlines nor the handlebar been as Polish 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.539
 then collapsed 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.619
 so he warned that the bars also that the rose has competed in the 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.629
 municipal command center in front of a 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.769
 and we started which hospital to be checked and the list was not the only one 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.659
 moment of rest 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.619
 I did not have any time when I thought that they do not end 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.569
 I had never left Colombia this was my first trip outside of 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.509
 Colombia 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.429
 ii min 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:56.989
 I felt for the need of the ten that he had to travel to be able to 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.129
 discover myself more viii to see how other people lived 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.279
 his life every day then the question 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.109
 like me 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.489
 triumphed by motorcycles for me the only way to make the trip of 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.839
 I return on a motorcycle 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:17.209
 and I had a twinge replace 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.259
 yes 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.459
 i 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.739
 when he said closing the session on Friday 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.470
 p with my motorcycle and in mind my then I decided missions and states 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.659
 with a pattern I was thinking you can in all this 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:39.729
 but a 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.919
 so do not start to see how far it goes 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.240
 and how far to get to look for a job a liter at a time and continue 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.069
 eta on Saturday still 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.879
 offer articles without photos the magazine of other countries because yes to the 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.449
 buyers that we go with a fight 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.419
 the vilas 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.800
 And despite closing as the idea put the oak before it was 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.460
 exposed to what will happen and 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.870
 and I thought that the one of those three or four years 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.520
 because obviously one having to stop and work and get the bring 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.110
 and for example the access 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.250
 ccd 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.569
 you have to work hard to do it 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.050
 3 personally I bet on the other hand the professional whom another with stocked 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.449
 valladolid 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.590
 I do not see how they come out
