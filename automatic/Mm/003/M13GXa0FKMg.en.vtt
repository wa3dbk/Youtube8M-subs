I like to use my fingers really a lot
more<00:00:02.700> than<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> knife<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.290> just<00:00:04.560> kind<00:00:04.920> of

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
more than a knife and I just kind of

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.850 
more than a knife and I just kind of
worked<00:00:06.779> my<00:00:06.899> way<00:00:07.170> around<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:08.010> bone<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:10.590> joint

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
worked my way around the bone the joint

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.640 
worked my way around the bone the joint
like<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.450> and<00:00:12.450> you'll<00:00:12.599> feel<00:00:12.840> those<00:00:13.110> tendons

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
like this and you'll feel those tendons

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
like this and you'll feel those tendons
they're<00:00:13.889> tough<00:00:14.389> you<00:00:15.389> probably<00:00:15.780> won't<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.080> able

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
they're tough you probably won't be able

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.210 
they're tough you probably won't be able
to<00:00:16.230> snap<00:00:16.529> them<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.070> fingers<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:19.220> mm

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
to snap them with your fingers so mm

to snap them with your fingers so mm
then<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> can't<00:00:21.840> get<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.680> my<00:00:22.890> fingers<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
then what I can't get with my fingers I

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.080 
then what I can't get with my fingers I
just<00:00:23.730> stick<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> knife<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.480> there<00:00:24.630> cut<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:26.090> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
just stick the knife in there cut up and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.370 
just stick the knife in there cut up and
then<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.390> start<00:00:27.779> working<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:30.380> it

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
then I can start working it down it

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.010 
then I can start working it down it
won't<00:00:31.560> come<00:00:31.890> off<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.820> bone<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> I
