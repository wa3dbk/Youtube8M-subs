00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.479 
in terms of like jokes and sounds
because<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.949> happened<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.279> South

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
because of what happened in South

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
because of what happened in South
Carolina<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.940> maybe<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:34.020> wasn't<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.590> in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
Carolina and maybe if I wasn't here in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.620 
Carolina and maybe if I wasn't here in
the<00:00:34.770> end<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> run<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.940> wasn't<00:00:36.180> such<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the end of the run or this wasn't such a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
the end of the run or this wasn't such a
common<00:00:37.050> occurrence<00:00:37.110> maybe<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.280> could<00:00:39.239> have

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
common occurrence maybe I could have

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.790 
common occurrence maybe I could have
pulled<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> spiral<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.440> didn't

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
pulled out of the spiral but I didn't

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.830 
pulled out of the spiral but I didn't
and<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.440> honestly<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.980> nothing

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
and so I honestly have have nothing

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
and so I honestly have have nothing
other<00:00:45.840> than<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.170> sadness<00:00:46.950> once<00:00:47.460> again<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
other than just sadness once again that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.380 
other than just sadness once again that
we<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.350> peer<00:00:49.800> into<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.070> abyss<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
we have to peer into the abyss of the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
we have to peer into the abyss of the
depraved<00:00:51.809> violence<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> each

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
depraved violence that we do to each

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.250 
depraved violence that we do to each
other<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> Nexus<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.590> gaping

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
other and the Nexus of a just gaping

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
other and the Nexus of a just gaping
racial<00:00:58.260> wound<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.890> will<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.670> heal<00:01:00.180> yet<00:01:00.390> we

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
racial wound that will not heal yet we

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
racial wound that will not heal yet we
pretend<00:01:01.140> doesn't<00:01:01.890> exist

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
pretend doesn't exist

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.920 
pretend doesn't exist
and<00:01:03.710> I'm<00:01:04.880> confident<00:01:05.880> though<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:08.930> by

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and I'm confident though that by

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
and I'm confident though that by
acknowledging<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.830> by<00:01:11.280> staring<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
acknowledging it by staring into that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
acknowledging it by staring into that
and<00:01:14.210> seeing<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.979> we<00:01:16.979> still

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and seeing it for what it is we still

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.770 
and seeing it for what it is we still
won't<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.450> jack<00:01:19.580> yeah<00:01:21.380> that's<00:01:22.380> us<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.780> that's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
won't do jack yeah that's us and that's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.390 
won't do jack yeah that's us and that's
the<00:01:25.020> part<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.259> blows<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.799> mind<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> don't<00:01:26.280> want

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the part that blows my mind I don't want

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
the part that blows my mind I don't want
to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> political<00:01:27.450> argument<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
to get into the political argument of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.190 
to get into the political argument of
the<00:01:28.740> guns<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.549> things<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.720> blows

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the guns and things but what what blows

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.510 
the guns and things but what what blows
my<00:01:31.470> mind<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.670> disparity<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> response

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
my mind is the disparity of response

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
my mind is the disparity of response
between<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.750> people<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.040> are

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
between when we think people that are

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
between when we think people that are
foreign<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> kill<00:01:39.600> us<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.960> us

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
foreign are going to kill us and us

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.550 
foreign are going to kill us and us
killing<00:01:40.920> ourselves<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:42.320> this<00:01:43.320> had<00:01:43.619> been<00:01:45.560> what

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
killing ourselves if this had been what

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
killing ourselves if this had been what
we<00:01:46.680> thought<00:01:46.890> was<00:01:47.100> Islamic<00:01:47.610> terrorism<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
we thought was Islamic terrorism it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.420
