00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.620 
thing that we should probably do is give
it<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.530> new<00:01:42.710> name<00:01:42.740> because<00:01:43.400> recorded<00:01:44.360> sound

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
it a new name because recorded sound

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.080 
it a new name because recorded sound
just<00:01:45.260> isn't<00:01:45.590> very<00:01:45.770> descriptive<00:01:46.370> so<00:01:46.970> we're

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
just isn't very descriptive so we're

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.110 
just isn't very descriptive so we're
going<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.299> type<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:47.780> water<00:01:48.229> flow<00:01:48.790> once<00:01:49.790> we<00:01:49.970> have

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
going to type in water flow once we have

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.760 
going to type in water flow once we have
it<00:01:50.240> named<00:01:50.450> there<00:01:50.750> are<00:01:50.870> three<00:01:51.170> very<00:01:51.530> simple

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
it named there are three very simple

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.250 
it named there are three very simple
controls<00:01:52.360> starting<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> right<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:54.140> can

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
controls starting on the right we can

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.380 
controls starting on the right we can
start<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.680> stop<00:01:54.740> recording<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:55.940> can<00:01:56.120> stop

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
start and stop recording we can stop

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.200 
start and stop recording we can stop
recording<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.590> can<00:01:57.740> play<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.040> back<00:01:58.220> we<00:01:58.970> can

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
recording and we can play it back we can

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.969 
recording and we can play it back we can
pause<00:01:59.540> in<00:01:59.810> between<00:01:59.840> if<00:02:00.380> we<00:02:00.560> need<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.799> take<00:02:00.920> a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
pause in between if we need to take a

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.230 
pause in between if we need to take a
look<00:02:01.190> at<00:02:01.310> our<00:02:01.400> notes<00:02:01.580> or<00:02:01.820> get<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:01.970> drink<00:02:02.090> of

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
look at our notes or get a drink of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.730 
look at our notes or get a drink of
water<00:02:02.450> while<00:02:02.750> we're<00:02:02.869> speaking<00:02:03.290> without

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
water while we're speaking without

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.649 
water while we're speaking without
having<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.340> create<00:02:04.580> multiple<00:02:04.909> narration

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
having to create multiple narration

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.750 
having to create multiple narration
files<00:02:05.930> when<00:02:06.799> we're<00:02:06.920> all<00:02:07.010> finished<00:02:07.250> we'll

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
files when we're all finished we'll

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.440 
files when we're all finished we'll
click<00:02:07.970> OK

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
click OK

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.749 
click OK
so<00:02:09.110> let's<00:02:09.289> just<00:02:09.560> do<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.769> little<00:02:10.039> sample<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.580> how

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
so let's just do a little sample of how

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.849 
so let's just do a little sample of how
this<00:02:10.940> might<00:02:11.150> work<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:12.049> next<00:02:12.319> few<00:02:12.439> seconds

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:12.859 
this might work for the next few seconds

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.500 
this might work for the next few seconds
I'm<00:02:13.040> going<00:02:13.219> to<00:02:13.340> stop<00:02:13.579> describing<00:02:14.090> what<00:02:14.389> I'm

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
I'm going to stop describing what I'm

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.059

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
working or thinking about narration we

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.400 
working or thinking about narration we
think<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:13.390> means<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.780> entire<00:03:14.110> presentation

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
think that means the entire presentation

think that means the entire presentation
and<00:03:15.099> sometimes<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.300> true<00:03:16.630> but<00:03:16.930> not

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
and sometimes that is true but not

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.830 
and sometimes that is true but not
always<00:03:17.370> often<00:03:18.370> many<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.730> our<00:03:18.880> slides<00:03:19.209> are<00:03:19.480> self

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
always often many of our slides are self

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.020
