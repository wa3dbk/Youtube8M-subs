00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.299
 dvd criticism and the Nazis themselves in 1945 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.120
 on the dark side of the moon 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 have fled around then 2018 with all 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.969
 the strength to come back to earth 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.889
 and submit to it 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.990
 yes, that could almost spring from 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.699
 tarantino and good material for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 a very well made trashfilm 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.420
 but if this really applies or 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.310
 just a very stupid idea 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.310
 Clearly we at Iron Sky today 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.660
 as spirit from the year 2012 the 92 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.550
 minutes is a german finnish 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.590
 Australian production tells the story 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.810
 history what if the Nazi itself 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.160
 against the defeat for it 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.170
 decided in the second world war 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.100
 the best and last elite men on 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.900
 to send the moon 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.150
 to ripen to their old strength again 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.800
 to breed an Aryan breed 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.879
 then around 2018 on the earth 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.980
 to return 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.900
 how did that call many genre fans 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.360
 the plan and is a very quirky idea 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 but this one actually visually 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.050
 translated very well so we learn that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.880
 National Socialism actually one 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.310
 completely unrecognized political attitude 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.260
 is the very very close and heartfelt 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.700
 that's all 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.620
 Of course, just as the animals here too 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.020
 understand and that you can try 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.550
 quite simple with old technology and 9 feet 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.960
 to return to earth again 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.540
 to subdue humankind there 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.810
 just stupid that just there 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.780
 presidential election campaign in the usa 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.820
 raging where a reigning president in 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.170
 form of a server palin blend 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.490
 but would love to lead to war 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.570
 to be re-elected and the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.159
 political attitude 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.200
 National Socialists not even that way 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.420
 bad, yes that sounds all very 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.700
 confusing and that's exactly what a sky is 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.409
 Abos circle a seven and a half million 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.780
 the dollar budget movie the pretty 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.219
 neatly with the optics can come up 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.180
 and also known for that reason 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.729
 because it is one of the best 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.409
 that means that crowdfunding projects 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.509
 from this budget just under a million 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.549
 through donations from fans and ideors 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.960
 has been funded and that everything 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.280
 in the very small area and very much 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.049
 very well known by this 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.789
 but also many people had become 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.100
 With writing were allowed to write history 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.570
 this film and you ask yourself 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 many cooks do not spoil the porridge and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.680
 I say yes and spirit 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.390
 string together of many 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.100
 crazy idea so we have here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.080
 a christopher kirby as james 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 Washington is really good for her here 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.190
 a black man plays with the help 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.690
 an albini sievers is made 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.190
 and a brainwashing the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.260
 subjected to Nazism 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.300
 the whole of a scientist on 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.310
 setting the movie as minimal 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.780
 is called yes that sounds bizarre 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.580
 maybe find that one or 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 other funny can always be in this film 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.140
 Many scenes or a few scenes 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.610
 loud laugh but on 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.610
 then you want to be ashamed of strangers 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.150
 just creep and so is one 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.830
 cut together from many 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.569
 individual scenes that really no 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.819
 want to go to all the movies and he then 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.890
 also good and like 15 20 minutes too 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.780
 is long and yes it is quite a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.160
 Daring and great , the Nazis tried 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.750
 but to pull across the cocoa 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.280
 unfortunately not really successful 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.900
 Among other things, that also has with the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.850
 nobody can do any act here 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.050
 really come up you wonder how 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.459
 is it that Germany a 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.650
 international production the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.569
 play the main role yes because Nazis the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.370
 Main characters are sad but true 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.110
 and so we have Julia Dietze and Gotz 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.239
 Both are pretty average 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.370
 but play the Aryan picture of 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.440
 main characters exactly according to all 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.390
 Otto as a big masculine strong man 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.030
 in the form of klaus adler and julia dietze 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.580
 as a blond aryan race women form 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.110
 by renate richter is the clichÃ© purely 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.000
 the whole thing with okay as well 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.250
 villain and as the current leader 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.220
 the moon completes one can only say 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.630
 that is all very nice to look at 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.190
 one or the other moment but in total 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.560
 a fairly weak only times just 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.000
 because the expectations were so great too 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.380
 and in the library I wondered 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.880
 have that movie there 40 times in 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.110
 Rent is always on loan is that 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.970
 is always a warning sign 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.680
 the more often a film shelf is the more 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.170
 unfortunately he is worse god often 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.700
 once ok, as ghost has the movie of that 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.290
 you have heard a lot for years because the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.790
 Production has a huge own 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.500
 history and is finally in the end 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.700
 just a movie if it is just this 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.620
 prehistory does not give this 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.540
 crazy idea that the underlying put 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.640
 would disappear in the crowd of the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.320
 you would not hear very much and is 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.970
 if I'm honestly no 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.370
 big number and not really 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.870
 worth seeing as science fiction film 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.209
 Comedy still with a good one 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.440
 really amazing optics for just 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.450
 not even eight million dollars 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.890
 budget comes I have to say 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.150
 I make the movie a science fiction movie 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.400
 comedian with whom he smiles now and then 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.930
 and also a two laugh can always 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.580
 still below average though 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.190
 acceptable four out of ten possible 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.440
 scores with quite weak overall 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.720
 number 1 film where he would have from the 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.430
 and idea so much joke and charm and stuff 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.289
 you can still get a lot out of it 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.120
 merciless and less stupid 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.919
 would have been and that will be reflected 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.510
 unfortunately now with two and a half of 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.020
 10 possible points for me in total 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.850
 low 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.750
 okay, what do you think about the movie? 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.850
 her seen in the cinema or outside case 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.470
 rausgeholt what is your opinion I was 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.330
 the very of mine I can do it myself 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.160
 Hardly anyone else would imagine 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 movie never heard of it just clicks 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.730
 times the trailer over here by the way 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.700
 with the beginning begins to set or 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.850
 the beginning of writing 2018, there is something on 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.590
 the Nazi and yes he has a lot 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.610
 cult has a lot of it in film 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.260
 as I said not stuck 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.730
 otherwise if you my review right 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.080
 stupid finds load more underneath 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.730
 check out facebook with us if we can 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.560
 continue to talk about film and 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.000
 that was it from me for this morning around 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.100
 15 clock see us again, of course 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.330
 a new review and hope so far 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.070
 I'll be back tomorrow 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.070
 of course at 3
