more but it's definitely worth trying
once<00:06:03.280> just<00:06:03.550> for<00:06:03.610> fun<00:06:04.800> looks<00:06:05.800> like<00:06:07.890> I've

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
once just for fun looks like I've

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.670 
once just for fun looks like I've
probably<00:06:09.430> been<00:06:09.820> through<00:06:10.480> almost<00:06:10.810> all<00:06:11.350> of<00:06:11.530> them

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
probably been through almost all of them

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.260 
probably been through almost all of them
right<00:06:11.920> now<00:06:12.100> I'm<00:06:12.370> sure<00:06:12.610> they'll<00:06:12.790> add<00:06:12.940> more<00:06:13.180> in

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
right now I'm sure they'll add more in

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.000 
right now I'm sure they'll add more in
the<00:06:13.390> future<00:06:13.540> more<00:06:13.870> locations<00:06:14.410> because<00:06:14.680> this

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
the future more locations because this

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.080 
the future more locations because this
is<00:06:15.130> just<00:06:15.340> kind<00:06:15.460> of<00:06:15.550> a<00:06:15.640> fun<00:06:16.420> glyph<00:06:16.780> so<00:06:17.850> let's<00:06:18.850> try

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
is just kind of a fun glyph so let's try

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.210 
is just kind of a fun glyph so let's try
a<00:06:19.120> few<00:06:19.330> more<00:06:19.390> times<00:06:19.780> and<00:06:20.050> if<00:06:20.170> that's<00:06:20.350> nothing

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
a few more times and if that's nothing

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.850 
a few more times and if that's nothing
of<00:06:21.670> course<00:06:21.970> right<00:06:22.270> here<00:06:22.300> I<00:06:22.890> guess<00:06:23.890> I'll<00:06:24.070> end<00:06:24.220> it

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
of course right here I guess I'll end it

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.100 
of course right here I guess I'll end it
