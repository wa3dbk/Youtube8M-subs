and<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.350> think<00:02:14.770> they<00:02:14.860> saw<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.070> value<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.760> what

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and I think they saw the value that what

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.970 
and I think they saw the value that what
this<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.810> know<00:02:16.900> what<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.170> potential<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.800> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this you know what the potential is to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.290 
this you know what the potential is to
have<00:02:18.130> something<00:02:18.490> like<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.760> be<00:02:18.910> part<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.210> a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
have something like this be part of a

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.720 
have something like this be part of a
healthcare<00:02:19.750> system<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.190> really<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.580> about

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
healthcare system and it really is about

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.670 
healthcare system and it really is about
how<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:22.180> move<00:02:22.330> more<00:02:22.540> toward<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.230> preventive

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
how do we move more toward a preventive

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.500 
how do we move more toward a preventive

sick and then treat them and we think

sick and then treat them and we think
we're<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.120> know<00:02:28.210> that's<00:02:28.450> where<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.660> two

back to my grandma I wonder if I have
the<00:03:07.930> gene<00:03:08.440> for<00:03:08.920> breast<00:03:09.550> cancer<00:03:10.350> even<00:03:11.350> though

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
the gene for breast cancer even though

I'm<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.590> male<00:03:11.770> you<00:03:12.070> could<00:03:12.190> still<00:03:12.370> pass<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:12.700> gene

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
I'm a male you could still pass the gene

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.440 
I'm a male you could still pass the gene
on<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:14.770> didn't<00:03:15.130> get<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.400> then<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> started<00:03:16.330> to

sister I don't see Parkinson's yet I
don't<00:03:22.270> have<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.930> gene<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:23.500> cystic<00:03:23.530> fibrosis
