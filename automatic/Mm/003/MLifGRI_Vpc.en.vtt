00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and I'm really hoping she won't eat all

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.290 
and I'm really hoping she won't eat all
this<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.190> let<00:00:50.370> her<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.910> much<00:00:51.120> as

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
this but I will let her you as much as

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.689 
this but I will let her you as much as
she<00:00:51.480> wants<00:00:51.559> that<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.980> big<00:00:53.219> doughnut
