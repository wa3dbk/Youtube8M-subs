00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.160
 although about the cheapest coupes 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.780
 that you can buy in the Chilean market 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.309
 notes that the car has all the 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.019
 sportsmanship without sacrificing with 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.469
 they 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.469
 let's find out 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.070
 the trunk can be opened from the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.530
 key or from inside the car 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.540
 the trunk itself is quite wide and 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.420
 it has a good depth but in 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.220
 how much height is a bit limited 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.340
 here under the floor we have the wheel 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.930
 spare and on both sides we have more 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.540
 space where they can save the kit 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.760
 emergency or hide some other 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.489
 objects that we want the seats 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.260
 we can reduce what is here where 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.809
 they just let go and then we have 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.640
 to get into the car to finish 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.210
 beat them let's see that only 600 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.210
 backs 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.439
 the seats in the back plaza are 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.149
 quite comfortable and we have support 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.649
 central radio with two inns that are 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.840
 adds to the sub that there is in each 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.759
 cost as expected space 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.470
 that back is quite limited and my 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.570
 knees are practically touching the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.090
 front seat and my head is 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
 touching the ceiling it is worth mentioning that 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.409
 windows in the rear seats do not 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.770
 they are going to open and that here we have two 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 air conditioning exits 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.390
 let's see how the squares are 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390
 front 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.810
 i 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.420
 like most premium guides 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.399
 This car has access to Achilles and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.049
 a start button the position of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.090
 driving in this car is quite low in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.649
 very sporty and we also have these 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 details that bounce the sports car 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.030
 like the aluminum pedals or these 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.100
 carbon fiber imitation details 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.630
 we also realize that all the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.939
 driving position is geared to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.909
 be a driver because the same radio is 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.979
 pointing towards one in space 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.039
 down here the power to central we have 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.289
 a large space we have two shots two 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.780
 cup holder and front lever 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.519
 changes we have another space with two more 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.299
 USB input and input receptacles 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.799
 assistant 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.080
 It should be noted that this car does not count 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.860
 with air conditioning and only has air 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.860
 manual conditioning 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080
 as I'm most likely to do 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.760
 I spent most of the time in the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.739
 city let's start talking about what 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.410
 such behaves to leave me in the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.810
 day by day the first place the suspension 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.459
 it is quite comfortable absorbs all 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.400
 bumps in the road and the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.690
 address is an electrical address that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.700
 has three driving modes here we have 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.340
 a button with which we can change the 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.850
 driving modes has a normal mode a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.650
 comfort mode and a sport mode the only 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.900
 that we are testing has a box of 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.580
 six mechanical speeds that is 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.230
 quite comfortable to handle it in the day 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.050
 to day the changes are quite accurate 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.720
 The feeling of the clutch is very 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.390
 nice and it's really comfortable to 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.830
 occupy it in the day to day most of 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.230
 the cars that have a scarce 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.940
 visibility but this is not the case 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.430
 visibility to central is almost the same 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.140
 of a car are and the only drawback 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.519
 What we have is that the pillars are 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.260
 wide enough that these pillars are 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.569
 here before we can be when 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.160
 we want to bend in some corner although 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.810
 probably to this taste is going to 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.299
 give a use more than anything or city that in 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.010
 east road that has a look 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.540
 pretty sporty so let's see 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.069
 how does this car behave 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.069
 demand on a mountain road 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.860
 Here we are testing is that here in a 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.690
 more sporty driving on a road of 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.580
 mountain with high curves with the road that 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.490
 it makes sharp turns without a doubt here 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.710
 we can get the juice out of the car 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.990
 As I said above, overcoming 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.850
 This car is very soft and very comfortable 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.440
 for a city management but if 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.720
 we want to demand a little bit of the car in 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.160
 curves unfortunately the car will be 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.560
 balance a little more than we 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.180
 like the gearbox is really 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.840
 nice for a little more handling 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.610
 sports 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.240
 the changes are quite short with the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.310
 drop pretty precise as we carry a 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.830
 handling a little more sporty we put the 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.320
 direction in sport mode where is 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.910
 far more accurate , however , also 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.470
 it feels much heavier and this is 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.660
 it feels pretty artificial 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.850
 the tea engine that feels pretty 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.490
 It is a powerful 2 liter engine of a 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.470
 little more than 150 horsepower that 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.480
 really wake up after three 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.160
 fifteen hundred revolutions then that 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.500
 we can demand it up to approximately 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.620
 the six thousand five hundred people by 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.620
 minute 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.919
 even though this engine is enough to 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.479
 this arch 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.889
 I think it is necessary that I want to start 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.540
 to use smaller turbo engines 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.100
 displacement of their models for 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.550
 get better benefits with a 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.550
 lower consumption 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.970
 I appreciate part of the ten million 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.830
 seven hundred thousand pesos where it includes 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.960
 front proximity sensors and 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.640
 rear access quiles and control of 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.380
 cruise speed in terms of 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.780
 security only includes double airbags 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.730
 front with abs informant drum 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.380
 back then we have the versions 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.390
 intermediates that add button 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.370
 headlights lights led tires 17 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.080
 inches sant rafel electric and control 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.670
 of stability unfortunately if 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.440
 we want to have side airbags and 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.270
 curtain we should get to the last 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.280
 version with a price of 13 million 200 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.830
 thousand pesos that is available only with 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.180
 a manual six - speed gearbox this 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.449
 version also adds bluetooth radio 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.330
 recoil camera and leather seats 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.710
 in summary this is a pretty car 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.659
 comfortable for - carlos on a daily basis 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.189
 both in town and on the road and if 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.349
 we wish we can have a management 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.389
 pretty entertaining if you liked this 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.039
