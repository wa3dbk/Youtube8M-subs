the<00:00:34.410> first<00:00:34.590> thing<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.250> shut<00:00:35.520> off

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the first thing you need to do shut off

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.160 
the first thing you need to do shut off
your<00:00:35.880> water<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.570> may<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> ball<00:00:37.140> valve

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
your water you may have a ball valve

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.680 
your water you may have a ball valve
like<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.160> your<00:00:38.579> incoming<00:00:39.180> water<00:00:39.390> line

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
like this on your incoming water line

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.180 
like this on your incoming water line
before<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.680> ultraviolet<00:00:41.780> pre-filter<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:43.190> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
before the ultraviolet pre-filter or a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.069 
before the ultraviolet pre-filter or a
gate<00:00:44.610> valve<00:00:44.820> something<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> some<00:00:45.899> way

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
gate valve something like that some way

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
gate valve something like that some way
of<00:00:46.200> shutting<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.920> water<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.640> next

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
of shutting off your water the next

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
housing and open up the water flow again

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
housing and open up the water flow again
now<00:01:22.140> at<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.950> time<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.670> ultraviolet<00:01:24.330> light

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
now at this time your ultraviolet light

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
now at this time your ultraviolet light
has<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.680> whole<00:01:25.950> process<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
has to be on for this whole process so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
has to be on for this whole process so
make<00:01:27.330> sure<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.080> before<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.740> any

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
make sure that it is before you go any

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700 
make sure that it is before you go any
further<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.360> next<00:01:30.630> step<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
further the next step is you go the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.420 
further the next step is you go the
furthest<00:01:32.100> away<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:33.740> from<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.860> ultraviolet

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
furthest away from from your ultraviolet

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
furthest away from from your ultraviolet
light<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.000> something<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.810> water

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
light that you have something a water

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.100 
light that you have something a water
source<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.490> tap<00:01:38.729> toilet<00:01:39.509> shower<00:01:39.780> or

source be it a tap toilet shower or
something<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
something like that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
something like that
and<00:01:41.070> starting<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> cold<00:01:42.420> water<00:01:42.689> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and starting with the cold water you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.380 
and starting with the cold water you
need<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.140> run<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> cold<00:01:43.710> water<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.310> point

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
need to run the cold water at that point

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.359 
need to run the cold water at that point
until<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.780> smell<00:01:46.049> chlorine<00:01:46.380> coming<00:01:47.009> from<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
until you smell chlorine coming from the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.460 
until you smell chlorine coming from the
water<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.939> tap<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.020> also<00:01:49.170> use
