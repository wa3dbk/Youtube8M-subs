00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.950
 good today we are here in a chapter 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:10.310
 more than this time we are on the map of 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.050
 asia guys to be although the play we're going 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.599
 to see how is this super map made 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.730
 for these super cool and people who are 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.689
 that's super server so good 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.689
 let's see how it goes 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.900
 and we have there yesterday to believe that 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.550
 obviously extends our good 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.670
 friend town the truth is that I think that 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.670
 yes 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.760
 let's see let's see what's inside 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.620
 of a pumpkin 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.470
 and we're going to take all this because 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.330
 it was true we need a lot of everything 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.890
 I feel sorry for saying all this or if 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.170
 maybe I already said all this if we're going to 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.610
 take us all this I do not know for not knowing 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.620
 the pants not because we already have 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.820
 this and this one I have not boxed and has 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.250
 as exactly what I have to do 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.600
 put typical of me already know love 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.700
 to walk failing 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.070
 in everything I do I simply hope 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.520
 have consecrated materials to be able 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.170
 crossing at some point to another site 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.850
 wow let's see if we're lucky this 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.590
 Once you know that in rugby was 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.510
 great interior I'm very glad that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.430
 are supporting these maps because the time 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.990
 that were done with a lot of love for 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.729
 the guys the server guys 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.290
 I say you have to come and see them 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.510
 yourselves and have a good time 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.950
 along with me too because I'm going to 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.350
 be coming back to make more videos here 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.610
 of a lot of games and this idea to 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.560
 beginning to see what a server will be 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.270
 small and he is really looking forward 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.650
 practice begins to grow more and 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.610
 good little in quotes do not say 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.470
 small because it's just starting 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.179
 but I know you will support it 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.850
 a lot and they will have a good time 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.340
 here so let's see let's see 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.840
 we go there I believe and I'm a boy 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.420
 of this improvement more towards the part of the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.040
 center because it's that I'm afraid of 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.550
 everybody here this is the people to a 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.160
 p is many people maybe have to 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.500
 be careful with these people I want to 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.750
 say nothing because they are there among them 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.880
 losing is winning from the hairs not 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.500
 I want to see not even because it's that I 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.690
 it's sad to see people pulling 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.850
 of the buts images of people who 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.070
 I would like you to pray more per day 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.210
 I'm not saying it's wrong to be here 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.210
 you would love me 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.819
 up to other sites 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.450
 why did you say that you had caught me 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.610
 You're going to kill me because you do not see me 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.440
 to kill beyond 80 in easy not so easy 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.819
 At least a little bit will cost you 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.099
 less a little more 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.690
 at least that's what I'm going to do 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.060
 that costs you at least a little more 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.530
 I think it's my job that I commit suicide 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.330
 I need we are going to put the stones 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.860
 pants I call the sword because I 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.140
 I am that these people are going to try to find me 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.989
 because look for me that you love 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.799
 look for death I love to try 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.799
 kill has gone chan 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.970
 nothing nothing 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:39.230
 in the absence of the date we lack the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.360
 metal droplets to see from any other 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.700
 thing because I have nothing to do more 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.530
 up there's nothing we'll have to 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.910

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.230

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.270
