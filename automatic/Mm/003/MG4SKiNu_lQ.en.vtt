00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.870
 Volkswagen presented in 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.960
 interior of são paulo 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.750
 o fox bluemotion year / model 2014 com 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.830
 very touching but the important 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.070
 premiere of the three-cylinder 1.0 engine 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.260
 new and advanced technology that is supposed 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.210
 waiting for the act to enter the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.780
 Lime flavor for September 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.989
 Focus no longer comes with 1.6 engine adopts 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.870
 this 1,095 generation came to european one 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.060
 year ago and now costs 32 thousand 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.860
 five hundred and ninety reais in the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.010
 two ports 3494 prices of the versions of 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.010
 input 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.600
 being the launch the new engine and 211 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.060
 82 horses accepted new 75 gasoline is 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.070
 produced in the factory of são carlos and already 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.050
 follows the concept of downsizing with 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.970
 small engines with high power 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.400
 as it has become a trend in Europe due to 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.630
 emissions legislation. 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.930
 demanding 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.390
 the aluminum motor is 24 pounds over 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 light is already used in Europe but 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.450
 in brazil is being manufactured in 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.350
 factory of são carlos after 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.220
 investment of 335 million reais 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.310
 torque of 9.7 that forces us with gasoline 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.649
 10004 with alcohol provides 85% of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.840
 force from 2000 rpm 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.729
 reacting more rapidly 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.770
 accelerator and improving as a result 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.320
 the performance of urban traffic 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.539
 the adoption of the construction with three 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.119
 cylinders instead of the four more 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.460
 is a solution adopted by 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.289
 other brands with the same objectives and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.420
 has the advantages of reducing not only the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.330
 weight but also the number of components 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.789
 that it piston in bearings and improve the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.360
 loss of heat by increasing efficiency 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.360
 thermal 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.040
 with four valves per cylinder, 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.230
 head has intake control 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.140
 variable and has an exhaust manifold 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.820
 integrated into a single piece with 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.410
 liquid refrigeration 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.150
 this allows the engine to reach its 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.400
 ideal operating temperature plus 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.390
 quickly improving their efficiency 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.390
 thermal 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.489
 another important solution is the double 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.319
 cooling circuit that allows 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.200
 different temperature when the block and 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.120
 for the evolution head with respect to the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.260
 first flex engines ten years ago 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.629
 was the 211 1.0 is also the first engine 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.609
 in the country in this capacity range to 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.650
 receive a cold starting system that 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.819
 dispenses the use of the auxiliary tank 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.489
 for gasoline 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.489
 that famous and dinosaur tanking 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.909
 back to fox 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.129
 the model now reveals 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.049
 volkswagen engineers the economy of 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.310
 and fuel efficiency with 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.129
 performance that according to the data of the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.870
 the factory gives the acceleration from 0 to 100 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:28.489
 in 13 6 seconds and maximum speed of 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.049
 166 km per hour with gasoline with ethanol 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.260
 13.2 seconds for acceleration from 0 to 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.260
 100 and 167 maximum speed 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.950
 to make the exchange compatible with 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.340
 better engine torque to the transmission 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.090
 had elongated relationships of up to 10% in 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.260
 compared to that used in fox 1.0 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.300
 Aerodynamics was developed in a tunnel 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.430
 wind and low resistance tires 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.010
 to the so-called green bearing were 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.810
 adopted an increase in the application of 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.150
 binds in its composition 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.760
 the new model also received improvements 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.440
 in acoustic comfort with the use of 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.630
 major financiers in the 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.010
 exhaust and insulation blanket in the 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.340
 bodywork 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.350
 the whole fox bluemotion is 29 pounds 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.350
 lighter than version 1.0 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
 ae 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.980
 shut up
