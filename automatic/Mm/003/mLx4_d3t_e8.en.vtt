my face I didn't go crazy I just kept

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.039 
my face I didn't go crazy I just kept
the<00:03:12.840> long<00:03:13.049> layers<00:03:13.379> um<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.450> baby<00:03:15.689> hair<00:03:15.900> is

the long layers um and the baby hair is

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.349 
the long layers um and the baby hair is
really<00:03:16.469> really<00:03:16.739> apparent<00:03:17.459> which<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.299> don't

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
really really apparent which I don't

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.789 
really really apparent which I don't
mind<00:03:18.569> because<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.019> think<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.290> makes<00:03:19.439> it<00:03:19.590> look<00:03:19.709> a

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
mind because I think it makes it look a

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.030 
mind because I think it makes it look a
little<00:03:19.919> more<00:03:20.069> realistic<00:03:20.959> when<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.139> first<00:03:22.590> get

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
little more realistic when you first get

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.789 
little more realistic when you first get
this<00:03:23.340> um<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:24.419> will<00:03:24.719> have<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.019> lay<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.500> down

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
this um you will have to lay this down

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.629 
this um you will have to lay this down
which<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.400> why<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.290> washed<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.919> everything

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
which is why I washed it and everything

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.640 
which is why I washed it and everything
just<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:30.060> lay<00:03:30.569> all<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.930> these<00:03:31.260> hair<00:03:31.469> down

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
just to lay all of these hair down

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.210 
just to lay all of these hair down
because<00:03:32.159> the<00:03:32.609> roots<00:03:32.849> come<00:03:33.090> really<00:03:33.719> um<00:03:34.220> really

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
because the roots come really um really

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.149 
because the roots come really um really
puffy<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:36.030> thick<00:03:36.329> which<00:03:37.019> some<00:03:37.470> people<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:37.949> I

don't really like that I like for it to

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.119 
don't really like that I like for it to
look<00:03:39.720> more<00:03:39.840> realistic<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.709> look<00:03:40.829> like<00:03:40.949> my

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129
