00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.199
 in my story 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
 My story begins when my lord 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 father and my mother good lady so that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.919
 They decided to go on an adventure and they came 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.110
 to mallorca from Granada and not my parents 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:33.170

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.320
 a fat baby a baby with green eyes and 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.960
 blond a baby frog my brother hello what 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.180
 ago when my brother was nine years old 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.790
 and my sister who is a year younger 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.830
 I was eight years old and that little ball was born 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.400
 an island of the head they called 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.770
 nana or I know myself until I'm five years old and 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.480
 I repeat until I was five years old I was a little girl 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.460
 very pretty and could have even arrived 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.620
 to become famous if my mother had 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.860
 would have deigned to take me some 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.860
 TV ad casting or something 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.790
 she was good and loving and too 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.619
 generous maybe because when I had 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.800
 gum or candies preferred to give them to 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.410
 the people when I grew up and I started to get 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.560
 ugly that cell was born from there to what 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.210
 we call amanda my little sister 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.160
 while my parents and my brother were going to 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.290
 work to what was then our 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.170
 restaurant and where they made a meat 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.090
 with which I dropped my sister's tin 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.130
 greater care for the nights of us 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.720
 boredom looks like it was taking my 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.210
 sister to disguise me as shakira ya 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.980
 get to sing on the table and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.530
 over my tier 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.860
 there are three thousand two hundred 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.979
 video tapes of my dancing imitating 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.200
 to Shakira a little older I discovered that it was 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.140
 a very versatile girl and I was good at 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.790
 do everything and also had the hobby of 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.280
 put your eye on the camera lens 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.560
 to see what was inside and I got angry 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.490
 I slept with my mother because they would not let me 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.369
 look 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.710
 from 8 to 10 years old I say I say years 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.229
 I started to get interested in sports and 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.110
 I did all the possible sports up 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.910
 that I discovered one of my passions the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.000
 football but my mother did not want that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.120
 I played with children until the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 female beach and I spent three years being 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.980

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.560
 good and read play up the selection 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.420
 balearic second of that was a year that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.310

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.980
 Bullying on a scale of 1 to 10 would be 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.709
 a 45 the class did not talk to me 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.290
 they invented things about me and I did not stay 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.360
 school and the truth is that I had what 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.580
 I went through fatal even started to stop 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.860
 do everything that I liked but 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.410
 I discovered the woman that would change my life 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.510
 and my way of thinking completely 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.760
 demi lovato so I started to follow their 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.130
 advice and those of my mother and I worried 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.560
 from the bad little by little what my 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.510
 mother was fulfilled and some of the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.600
 people who did not speak to me passed to 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.300
 be 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.360

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.810
 children 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.180
 In a short time I discovered my true 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.610
 passion to dance and if they are the feet of 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.670

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.660

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.230
