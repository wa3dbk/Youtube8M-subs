on installing some the parts they could

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
on installing some the parts they could
be<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.520> tricky<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.780> we'll<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.050> started

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
vortexes hand at brawls foot because

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.870 
vortexes hand at brawls foot because
they're<00:00:43.470> both<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> couple<00:00:44.310> little<00:00:44.400> tips

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
they're both got a couple little tips

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.740 
they're both got a couple little tips
and<00:00:45.120> tricks<00:00:45.900> so<00:00:46.170> basically<00:00:47.420> what's<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.630> on

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and tricks so basically what's going on

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
and tricks so basically what's going on
here<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> installing<00:00:49.560> this<00:00:49.740> little<00:00:50.040> hand

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
here is installing this little hand

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.120 
here is installing this little hand
mount<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.940> tricky<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.350> i'm<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.950> to

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
mount can be tricky so i'm going to

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.090 
mount can be tricky so i'm going to
split<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> apart<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.560> take<00:00:55.560> it<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.040> then

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
split it apart and take it out and then

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.470 
split it apart and take it out and then
put<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.030> show<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.390> that's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
put it back in and show you what that's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.050 
put it back in and show you what that's
like<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> key<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:58.860> is<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.310> this

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
like so the key here is that this

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.479 
like so the key here is that this
actually<00:01:00.300> fits<00:01:00.750> underneath<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.890> knees<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
actually fits underneath the knees this

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
actually fits underneath the knees this
t-bar<00:01:03.060> and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:04.049> we've<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
t-bar and then we've actually got a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
t-bar and then we've actually got a
couple<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.489> posts<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.420> either<00:01:06.479> side

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
couple of little posts on either side

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320 
couple of little posts on either side
and<00:01:07.260> those<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.760> sockets

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and those actually go in the sockets

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
and those actually go in the sockets
behind<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.750> knees<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.650> we've<00:01:10.860> got<00:01:10.890> two

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
behind the knees and then we've got two

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.020 
behind the knees and then we've got two
little<00:01:11.990> pegs<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.770> those<00:01:14.310> help<00:01:14.700> close

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
little pegs here and those help close

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.469 
little pegs here and those help close
the<00:01:15.300> halves<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:17.000> helicopters<00:01:18.000> front<00:01:18.270> body

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the halves of the helicopters front body

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.500 
the halves of the helicopters front body
so<00:01:18.960> again<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.280> most<00:01:20.729> important<00:01:21.180> thing<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.330> do

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
so again the most important thing to do

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.020 
so again the most important thing to do
initially<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.770> try<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.430> tea<00:01:23.760> bar

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
initially is to try and get that tea bar

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.010 
initially is to try and get that tea bar
in<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.600> deep<00:01:25.380> inside<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.400> knees<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> I'm

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
in there deep inside the knees so I'm

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
in there deep inside the knees so I'm
just<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> pull<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.280> together

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
just going to kind of pull this together

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.080 
just going to kind of pull this together
and<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:31.320> sure<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.740> nested<00:01:32.340> deep<00:01:32.670> inside

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and make sure it's nested deep inside

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.960 
and make sure it's nested deep inside
there<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.710> then<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> somewhat

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there and then I'm going to somewhat

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.700 
there and then I'm going to somewhat
close<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> start<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.080> close<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
close this then I start to close the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
close this then I start to close the
other<00:01:37.830> part<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.580> then<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
other part and then what you do is you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.950 
other part and then what you do is you
look<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.210> sure<00:01:42.450> you're<00:01:42.690> putting

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
look here to make sure you're putting

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.770 
look here to make sure you're putting
the<00:01:43.049> posts<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.979> sockets<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:45.450> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the posts in the little sockets up in

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.649 
the posts in the little sockets up in
front<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> helicopter<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
front of the helicopter and then as you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.990 
front of the helicopter and then as you
do<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.890> close<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.580> two<00:01:50.729> halves

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
do that you just close the two halves

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.810 
do that you just close the two halves
and<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.460> fist<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.820> installed<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.760> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and the fist is installed so there you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
and the fist is installed so there you
go<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.750> part<00:01:57.990> done<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.470> in<00:01:58.560> terms<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
go that's one part done and in terms of

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.950 
go that's one part done and in terms of
installing<00:01:59.460> brawls<00:02:00.210> foot<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
installing brawls foot it can be a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920 
installing brawls foot it can be a
little<00:02:01.229> tricky<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> i'll<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:02.939> show<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.299> i'm

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
little tricky so i'll just show you i'm

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.670 
little tricky so i'll just show you i'm
going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> pop<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> foot<00:02:05.189> off<00:02:05.340> here's<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.180> leg

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
going to pop the foot off here's the leg

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.699 
going to pop the foot off here's the leg
off<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.689> so<00:02:09.689> the<00:02:10.049> key<00:02:10.229> here<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.499> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
off there we go so the key here is to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.229 
off there we go so the key here is to
actually<00:02:11.039> make<00:02:11.489> use<00:02:11.669> of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.969> ankle

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
actually make use of the ankle

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.179 
actually make use of the ankle
articulation<00:02:12.359> so<00:02:13.019> if<00:02:13.169> you<00:02:13.260> don't<00:02:13.499> what<00:02:14.069> you'll

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
articulation so if you don't what you'll

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.470 
articulation so if you don't what you'll
probably<00:02:14.340> find<00:02:14.609> is<00:02:14.849> you're<00:02:14.969> trying<00:02:15.120> to

probably find is you're trying to
push<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.690> on<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.110> wall<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.379> in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.769> way<00:02:16.920> so

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
push this on this wall is in the way so

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.990 
push this on this wall is in the way so
the<00:02:18.239> tip<00:02:18.989> here<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.650> actually<00:02:19.830> lift<00:02:20.610> up<00:02:20.849> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the tip here is to actually lift up the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.320 
the tip here is to actually lift up the
foot<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.599> hold<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.379> then<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.580> you

hole in his fist to line up with the

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.900 
hole in his fist to line up with the
horizontal<00:02:32.670> post<00:02:33.420> right<00:02:33.989> here<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:35.129> what<00:02:35.790> you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.390 
the back so i actually did design in a
feature<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.049> can<00:03:04.200> take<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.160> large

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
feature so that you can take the large

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.630 
feature so that you can take the large
gun<00:03:05.760> here<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.359> install<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:08.400> didn't

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
gun here and install it and it didn't

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.640 
gun here and install it and it didn't
get<00:03:08.760> into<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.120> instructions<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.410> didn't

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
get into the instructions and it didn't

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.229 
get into the instructions and it didn't
get<00:03:10.739> talked<00:03:10.920> about<00:03:11.160> too<00:03:11.310> much<00:03:11.430> because<00:03:11.700> I

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
get talked about too much because I

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.910

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
wasn't a hundred percent confident it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.880 
wasn't a hundred percent confident it
would<00:03:13.980> work<00:03:14.129> with<00:03:14.310> all<00:03:14.459> kits<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.739> reality

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
would work with all kits so the reality

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.650 
would work with all kits so the reality
is<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.220> can't<00:03:17.579> work<00:03:17.879> with<00:03:18.030> all<00:03:18.150> kids<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.510> works

to show is couple things again in terms

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.899 
to show is couple things again in terms
of<00:04:21.479> posing<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.349> a<00:04:22.380> couple<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.400> undocumented

of posing and a couple of undocumented

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.640 
of posing and a couple of undocumented
so<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:25.620> first<00:04:25.860> one<00:04:26.039> is<00:04:26.099> actually<00:04:27.090> there<00:04:27.510> is

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
so the first one is actually there is

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.999 
so the first one is actually there is
articulation<00:04:28.650> in

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
articulation in

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.339 
articulation in
ankles<00:04:29.400> as<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:30.089> was<00:04:30.210> pointing<00:04:30.539> out<00:04:30.629> with

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
ankles as I was pointing out with

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.489 
ankles as I was pointing out with
installing<00:04:31.819> brawls<00:04:32.819> foot<00:04:33.059> so<00:04:33.389> some<00:04:34.259> people

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:34.499

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.079 
installing brawls foot so some people
may<00:04:34.619> not<00:04:34.710> realize<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:35.369> some<00:04:35.759> people<00:04:35.999> that

may not realize that some people that
don't<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.479> kid<00:04:36.629> yet<00:04:36.779> sometimes<00:04:37.139> you

have<00:04:37.379> to<00:04:37.499> actually<00:04:37.649> push<00:04:38.610> on<00:04:38.759> the<00:04:38.849> ratchets<00:04:39.240> a

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
have to actually push on the ratchets a

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.010 
have to actually push on the ratchets a
little<00:04:39.509> bit<00:04:39.659> to<00:04:39.839> get<00:04:39.960> them<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.819> to<00:04:41.819> pop<00:04:42.029> up<00:04:42.059> but

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
little bit to get them to to pop up but

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.450 
little bit to get them to to pop up but
it's<00:04:43.499> kind<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.710> nice<00:04:43.830> because<00:04:44.039> then<00:04:44.219> you<00:04:44.309> can

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
it's kind of nice because then you can

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.749 
it's kind of nice because then you can
do<00:04:44.610> more<00:04:45.089> a<00:04:45.330> type<00:04:45.960> stances<00:04:46.529> with<00:04:47.279> them<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:47.729> I

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
do more a type stances with them so I

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.070 
do more a type stances with them so I
just<00:04:47.999> wanted<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.270> let<00:04:48.539> everybody<00:04:48.779> know<00:04:48.960> about

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
just wanted to let everybody know about

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.659 
just wanted to let everybody know about
the<00:04:49.379> little<00:04:49.529> ratchets<00:04:49.949> in<00:04:50.069> there<00:04:50.189> and<00:04:50.339> we<00:04:50.490> just

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
the little ratchets in there and we just

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.850 
the little ratchets in there and we just
kind<00:04:50.849> of<00:04:50.909> pop<00:04:51.719> up<00:04:51.899> and<00:04:52.080> down<00:04:52.229> so<00:04:52.619> they're

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
kind of pop up and down so they're

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.339 
kind of pop up and down so they're
pretty<00:04:53.339> straightforward<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:55.020> other<00:04:55.139> thing

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
pretty straightforward the other thing

the<00:04:59.159> rub<00:04:59.339> is<00:04:59.669> this<00:04:59.879> name<00:05:00.199> on<00:05:01.199> another<00:05:02.009> way<00:05:02.159> to

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
the rub is this name on another way to

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.879 
the rub is this name on another way to
do<00:05:02.550> vortexes<00:05:03.419> arm<00:05:03.599> which<00:05:03.899> gives<00:05:04.139> you<00:05:04.379> 90

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
do vortexes arm which gives you 90

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.889 
do vortexes arm which gives you 90
degrees<00:05:05.249> elbow<00:05:05.789> bends<00:05:05.999> so<00:05:06.240> are<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.629> get<00:05:06.749> the

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:06.899 
degrees elbow bends so are you get the

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.529 
degrees elbow bends so are you get the
full<00:05:07.080> 90<00:05:07.319> degrees<00:05:07.589> with<00:05:07.740> blast<00:05:08.159> off<00:05:08.399> but<00:05:09.360> with

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
full 90 degrees with blast off but with

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.149 
full 90 degrees with blast off but with
vortex<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.319> always<00:05:10.559> kind<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.800> limited

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
vortex it's always kind of limited

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.850 
vortex it's always kind of limited
because<00:05:11.339> the<00:05:12.029> cockpits<00:05:12.990> in<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.229> way<00:05:13.319> so<00:05:13.800> you

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
because the cockpits in the way so you

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.779 
because the cockpits in the way so you
can<00:05:13.949> actually<00:05:14.219> rotate<00:05:14.430> this<00:05:15.949> 180<00:05:16.949> degrees<00:05:17.399> so

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
can actually rotate this 180 degrees so

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.519 
can actually rotate this 180 degrees so
normally<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:18.659> know<00:05:18.749> tend<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.169> show<00:05:19.289> it<00:05:19.409> like

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
normally I you know tend to show it like

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.409 
normally I you know tend to show it like
that<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:20.339> can<00:05:20.459> actually<00:05:20.610> rotate<00:05:20.999> this<00:05:21.360> around

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
that you can actually rotate this around

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.309 
that you can actually rotate this around
and<00:05:22.669> what<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.759> do<00:05:23.909> is<00:05:24.089> you<00:05:24.240> take<00:05:24.270> his<00:05:24.659> his

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
and what you do is you take his his

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.769 
and what you do is you take his his
little<00:05:25.709> waist<00:05:26.129> skirt<00:05:26.580> here<00:05:27.059> and<00:05:27.209> you<00:05:27.659> can

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
little waist skirt here and you can

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.230 
little waist skirt here and you can
pivot<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.229> up<00:05:28.379> and<00:05:28.649> then<00:05:29.339> as<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.550> pivot<00:05:29.999> it<00:05:30.089> up

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
pivot it up and then as you pivot it up

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.540 
pivot it up and then as you pivot it up
you<00:05:30.479> can<00:05:30.599> actually<00:05:31.020> rotate<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:32.219> arm<00:05:32.339> like

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
you can actually rotate the arm like

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.949 
you can actually rotate the arm like
that<00:05:32.699> and<00:05:32.909> that's<00:05:33.029> kind<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.360> neat<00:05:33.509> you<00:05:33.629> can<00:05:33.659> get

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:33.959 
that and that's kind of neat you can get

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.239 
that and that's kind of neat you can get
a<00:05:34.770> little<00:05:35.339> more<00:05:35.550> interesting<00:05:35.879> poses<00:05:36.300> with<00:05:36.749> him

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.249 
a little more interesting poses with him

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.809 
a little more interesting poses with him
with<00:05:38.249> the<00:05:38.599> waist<00:05:39.599> folded<00:05:39.990> around<00:05:40.080> backwards

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
with the waist folded around backwards

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.670 
with the waist folded around backwards
and<00:05:41.819> the<00:05:42.479> last<00:05:42.659> thing<00:05:42.839> that<00:05:42.899> I<00:05:43.020> wanted<00:05:43.319> to<00:05:43.439> show

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
and the last thing that I wanted to show

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.939
