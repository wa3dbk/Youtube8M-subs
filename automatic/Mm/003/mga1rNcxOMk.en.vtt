casting<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.560> own<00:00:16.710> metal<00:00:17.119> basically<00:00:18.119> going

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
casting your own metal basically going

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.740

and as you can see here this is a torch

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.190 
and as you can see here this is a torch
head<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> very<00:00:47.660> expensive<00:00:48.660> torch

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
head and this is a very expensive torch

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529 
head and this is a very expensive torch
actually<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.829> something<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.480> your

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
actually it's something that's not your

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.279 
actually it's something that's not your
normal<00:00:52.289> propane<00:00:53.039> torch<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.730> map<00:00:54.030> gas<00:00:54.329> map

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
normal propane torch this is map gas map

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.770 
normal propane torch this is map gas map
gases<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.160> pretty<00:00:58.460> it's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> lot<00:00:59.789> hotter<00:01:00.239> than

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
gases is pretty it's a lot hotter than

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
gases is pretty it's a lot hotter than
propane<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> notice<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> have

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
propane and if you notice here you have

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.000 
propane and if you notice here you have
an<00:01:02.879> oxygen<00:01:03.300> tank<00:01:03.480> next<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.470> order

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
an oxygen tank next to it now in order

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.649 
an oxygen tank next to it now in order
to<00:01:05.129> melt<00:01:05.400> copper<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.630> least

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to melt copper you have to have at least

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.490 
to melt copper you have to have at least
2,000<00:01:07.530> degrees<00:01:07.830> Fahrenheit<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> want

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit so if you want

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.429 
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit so if you want
to<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.010> least<00:01:11.479> 1902<00:01:12.479> 2,000<00:01:13.170> degrees

to get to at least 1902 2,000 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:13.970> you're<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> use<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
Fahrenheit you're going to have to use a

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.620 
Fahrenheit you're going to have to use a
oxy<00:01:17.930> map<00:01:18.979> combination<00:01:19.979> torch<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.420> just

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
oxy map combination torch if you just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.289 
oxy map combination torch if you just
buy<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> propane<00:01:22.350> torch<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:23.430> even<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> just

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
buy a propane torch or even if you just

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.450 
buy a propane torch or even if you just
use<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.750> regular<00:01:24.930> map<00:01:25.409> gas<00:01:25.710> torch<00:01:26.040> you're<00:01:26.310> not

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
use a regular map gas torch you're not

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
use a regular map gas torch you're not
going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> right<00:01:27.240> temperature<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
going to get to the right temperature so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.859 
going to get to the right temperature so
it's<00:01:28.650> very<00:01:28.829> important<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.509> torch

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it's very important that you get a torch

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.940 
it's very important that you get a torch
that<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:32.009> both<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.700> oxygen<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> map<00:01:34.710> gas

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that has both the oxygen and the map gas

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
that has both the oxygen and the map gas
now<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.970> quick<00:01:36.150> introduction<00:01:36.900> here

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
now just a quick introduction here

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
now just a quick introduction here
something<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:38.220> important<00:01:39.119> when<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.570> do

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
something very important when you do

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.840 
something very important when you do
light<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.430> oxygen<00:01:42.259> never<00:01:43.259> turn<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> oxygen

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
light your oxygen never turn the oxygen

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.210 
light your oxygen never turn the oxygen
on<00:01:44.970> first<00:01:45.270> always<00:01:45.570> light<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.409> map<00:01:46.619> gas<00:01:46.890> first

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
on first always light your map gas first

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.789 
on first always light your map gas first
I<00:01:47.460> repeat<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.899> those<00:01:49.049> people<00:01:49.110> who<00:01:49.470> have

not done this before you're going to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
not done this before you're going to
have<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.920> couple<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.520> cylinders<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.450> open

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
have a couple of cylinders here to open

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.050 
have a couple of cylinders here to open
up<00:01:54.899> never<00:01:55.350> touch<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.399> you're

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
up never touch this one first you're

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.230 
up never touch this one first you're
always<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.780> light<00:01:58.670> release<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.030> map

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
always going to light release the map

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.109 
always going to light release the map
gas<00:02:00.540> valve<00:02:01.049> very<00:02:01.560> slowly<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> you're<00:02:02.969> going

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
gas valve very slowly and you're going

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.440 
gas valve very slowly and you're going
to<00:02:03.180> take<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:04.130> striker<00:02:05.130> at<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> 45-degree

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
to take your striker at a 45-degree

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.430 
to take your striker at a 45-degree
angle<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.110> give<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.819> spark<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
angle and give it a little spark that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.840 
angle and give it a little spark that
will<00:02:10.500> turn<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.099> once

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
will turn it on once

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.210 
will turn it on once
this<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.270> turned<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.350> very<00:02:14.680> low<00:02:14.980> flame

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
this is turned on at a very low flame

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.940 
this is turned on at a very low flame
then<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.630> introduce<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.290> oxygen<00:02:17.770> and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
then you can introduce the oxygen and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.860 
then you can introduce the oxygen and
for<00:02:18.490> whatever<00:02:18.610> reason<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.360> does<00:02:19.570> go<00:02:19.840> out

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
for whatever reason if it does go out

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.340 
for whatever reason if it does go out
and<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.400> oxygen<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.120> always<00:02:23.050> turn

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
and you have the oxygen on always turn

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.710 
and you have the oxygen on always turn
the<00:02:23.500> oxygen<00:02:24.010> off<00:02:24.130> first<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.820> then<00:02:25.300> turn<00:02:25.570> off

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
the oxygen off first and then turn off

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.810 
the oxygen off first and then turn off
your<00:02:25.870> map<00:02:26.080> gas<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:26.980> I'll<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.220> repeat<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
your map gas so I'll just repeat that

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.530 
your map gas so I'll just repeat that
when<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.720> are<00:02:28.780> lighting<00:02:29.320> your<00:02:29.710> torch<00:02:30.540> never

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
when you are lighting your torch never

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.390 
when you are lighting your torch never
turn<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:33.040> oxygen<00:02:33.700> first<00:02:34.180> always<00:02:35.400> slightly

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
turn on the oxygen first always slightly

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.260 
turn on the oxygen first always slightly
open<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> valve<00:02:37.360> for<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.140> map<00:02:38.320> gas<00:02:39.060> light<00:02:40.060> it

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
open the valve for the map gas light it

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.650 
open the valve for the map gas light it
and<00:02:40.450> after<00:02:41.200> its<00:02:41.410> lit<00:02:41.710> you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.490> introduce<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
and after its lit you can introduce the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.920 
and after its lit you can introduce the
oxygen<00:02:44.230> very<00:02:44.920> slowly<00:02:45.310> okay<00:02:45.910> keep<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.780> in

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
oxygen very slowly okay keep that in

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.470 
oxygen very slowly okay keep that in
mind<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> first<00:02:49.090> thing<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.450> can

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
mind so that's the first thing you can

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.090 
mind so that's the first thing you can
buy<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> kit<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.380> for<00:02:50.770> about<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.950> hundred

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
up something called borax borax is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.720 
up something called borax borax is
something<00:03:20.290> that's<00:03:20.440> used<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:21.160> put<00:03:21.490> in<00:03:21.610> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
something that's used to put in the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.310 
something that's used to put in the
crucible<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.360> can<00:03:22.510> see<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.840> white<00:03:23.140> stuff

crucible you can see this white stuff

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.700 
crucible you can see this white stuff
basically<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.300> crucible<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.530> is

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
basically this is a crucible this is

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.110 
basically this is a crucible this is
what<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:28.200> containing<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.620> metal<00:03:30.490> that<00:03:30.640> you're

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
what is containing the metal that you're

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.430 
what is containing the metal that you're
going<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:32.160> melt<00:03:33.160> or<00:03:33.490> braised<00:03:34.180> or<00:03:34.420> whatever<00:03:34.780> so

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
going to melt or braised or whatever so

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.290 
going to melt or braised or whatever so
basically<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:35.920> put<00:03:36.310> some<00:03:36.490> copper<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:37.030> here<00:03:37.270> I

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
basically I put some copper in here I

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.570 
basically I put some copper in here I
put<00:03:37.570> some<00:03:37.810> borax<00:03:38.050> inside<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.040> prevents<00:03:39.430> it

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
put some borax inside so it prevents it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.400 
put some borax inside so it prevents it
from<00:03:39.670> oxidizing<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.570> well<00:03:40.780> as<00:03:40.900> gets<00:03:41.140> rid<00:03:41.320> of

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
from oxidizing as well as gets rid of

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.860 
from oxidizing as well as gets rid of
all<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.680> impurities<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:43.330> when<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.660> go<00:03:43.810> to

you grab it on the side like so and you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.050 
you grab it on the side like so and you
can<00:04:30.639> pour<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.240> once<00:04:31.930> it's<00:04:32.139> molten<00:04:32.560> hot

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
can pour it once it's molten hot

you're going to want to get something

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.309 
you're going to want to get something
called<00:05:55.750> Vaseline<00:05:56.469> petroleum<00:05:56.680> jelly<00:05:57.490> and<00:05:58.319> that

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
called Vaseline petroleum jelly and that

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.360 
called Vaseline petroleum jelly and that
will<00:05:59.680> be<00:06:00.360> basically<00:06:01.919> put<00:06:02.919> inside<00:06:03.310> your

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
will be basically put inside your

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.140 
will be basically put inside your
graphite<00:06:04.029> mode<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:05.080> way<00:06:05.400> it<00:06:06.400> doesn't<00:06:06.699> stick

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
graphite mode that way it doesn't stick

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.499
