there's lots of videos out there to do

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.730 
there's lots of videos out there to do

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
it this is actually my first time doing

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.339 
it this is actually my first time doing
it<00:00:20.009> so<00:00:20.189> we'll<00:00:20.790> see<00:00:20.910> how<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.150> goes<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.259> know

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
it so we'll see how it goes but you know

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.950 
it so we'll see how it goes but you know
I've<00:00:22.590> watched<00:00:22.770> some<00:00:22.980> videos<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.869> got<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
I've watched some videos and I got the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.269 
I've watched some videos and I got the
idea<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:25.680> sure<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.130> work

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
idea and I'm sure it's going to work

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.769 
idea and I'm sure it's going to work
because<00:00:26.490> they<00:00:27.300> don't<00:00:27.330> want<00:00:27.539> those<00:00:27.630> pretty

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
because they don't want those pretty

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.939 
because they don't want those pretty
much<00:00:27.840> no<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.230> wouldn't<00:00:28.439> work<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.740> I'm

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
much no way it wouldn't work but I'm

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.560 
much no way it wouldn't work but I'm
just<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.130> show<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.760> guys<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.180> I<00:00:30.210> did<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
lot of people say to use regular

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.160 
lot of people say to use regular

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
batteries to do it it's not smart

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.600 
batteries to do it it's not smart
because<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> voltage<00:00:34.830> you<00:00:35.070> need<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.340> use<00:00:35.460> your

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
because the voltage you need to use your

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.299 
because the voltage you need to use your
pack

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
pack

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.770

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.910 
slowly turn up the throttle film on your
receiver<00:02:04.080> so<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.140> ought<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.350> sit<00:02:05.650> there<00:02:05.800> and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
receiver so you ought to sit there and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:18.160 
receiver so you ought to sit there and
hold<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.890> there<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:15.730> go

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.910 

you<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.740> nice<00:02:18.920> flow<00:02:19.160> going<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:20.800> don't<00:02:21.800> want

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
you have a nice flow going I don't want

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.410 
you have a nice flow going I don't want
to<00:02:22.010> keep<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.520> mean<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.060> might<00:02:23.180> want<00:02:23.360> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
to keep you I mean you you might want to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.380 
to keep you I mean you you might want to
vary<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.660> speed<00:02:23.780> I'm<00:02:24.260> not<00:02:24.470> sure<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.090> would<00:02:26.090> like

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
vary the speed I'm not sure I would like

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.550 
vary the speed I'm not sure I would like
to<00:02:26.510> I'm<00:02:26.600> gonna<00:02:26.720> vary<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.020> speed<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.350> mind

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
to I'm gonna vary the speed of mind

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.830 
to I'm gonna vary the speed of mind
because<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:28.820> know<00:02:28.940> if<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.300> brake<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.690> motor

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
because you know if you brake in a motor

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.690 
because you know if you brake in a motor
slows<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.440> my<00:02:30.800> theory<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.250> motors

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
slows and I my theory is that motors

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.070 
slows and I my theory is that motors
gonna<00:02:31.820> be<00:02:31.910> slow<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.480> break<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.870> motor

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
gonna be slow you break in and motor

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.110 
gonna be slow you break in and motor
gradually<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.130> faster<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.490> faster<00:02:34.670> then

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
gradually and get faster and faster then

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.520 
gradually and get faster and faster then
that's<00:02:35.450> how<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> motor<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.960> normally<00:02:36.230> gonna<00:02:36.380> run

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that's how a motor is normally gonna run

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.850 
that's how a motor is normally gonna run
and<00:02:36.710> that's<00:02:37.250> how<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:37.430> gonna<00:02:37.550> do<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.860> just

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and that's how I'm gonna do it so just

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.720 
and that's how I'm gonna do it so just
you<00:02:39.980> know<00:02:40.040> every<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:41.020> don't<00:02:42.020> know<00:02:42.170> three<00:02:42.530> four

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
you know every I don't know three four

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.680 
you know every I don't know three four
minutes<00:02:43.730> something<00:02:44.209> like<00:02:44.360> that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
minutes something like that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.510 
minutes something like that
just<00:02:44.900> turn<00:02:45.050> your<00:02:45.080> throttle<00:02:45.770> control<00:02:46.100> up<00:02:46.280> or

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
just turn your throttle control up or

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.400 
just turn your throttle control up or
your<00:02:46.820> yeah<00:02:47.060> your<00:02:47.240> throttle<00:02:47.540> fin<00:02:47.690> up<00:02:47.930> even<00:02:48.260> more

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
your yeah your throttle fin up even more

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.960 
your yeah your throttle fin up even more
or<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:48.980> can<00:02:49.100> do<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.459> whole<00:02:49.550> pack<00:02:49.790> I'm

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
or you can do this for a whole pack I'm

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.460 
or you can do this for a whole pack I'm
not<00:02:50.120> gonna<00:02:50.270> do<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.450> for<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.570> whole<00:02:50.660> pack<00:02:50.870> I'm

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
not gonna do it for a whole pack I'm

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.070 
not gonna do it for a whole pack I'm
gonna<00:02:51.620> do<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.770> for<00:02:51.890> about<00:02:51.950> 20<00:02:52.340> minutes<00:02:52.580> or<00:02:52.640> so

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
gonna do it for about 20 minutes or so

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
it's all the crap that would be in your

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.930 
it's all the crap that would be in your
motor<00:03:29.709> if<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.799> broke<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.220> another<00:03:31.430> way<00:03:32.890> it

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
motor if you broke it in another way it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.539 
motor if you broke it in another way it
was<00:03:34.940> all<00:03:35.060> fine<00:03:35.769> motors<00:03:36.769> are<00:03:36.890> automatically

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
was all fine motors are automatically

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.720 
was all fine motors are automatically
waterproof<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:39.860> long<00:03:39.980> as<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.190> go<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.519> that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.680 

just<00:03:43.730> don't<00:03:43.880> do<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.239> brushless

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
just don't do this with a brushless

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.080 
just don't do this with a brushless
motor<00:03:44.989> make<00:03:45.680> sure<00:03:45.799> it's<00:03:45.890> brushed<00:03:46.130> all<00:03:46.940> right

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
motor make sure it's brushed all right

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.310 
motor make sure it's brushed all right
guys<00:03:47.209> one<00:03:47.390> more<00:03:47.540> thing<00:03:47.690> before<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:48.019> go

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
you need to spray motor cleaner in here

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.979 
you need to spray motor cleaner in here
and<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:54.799> want<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:54.980> spray<00:03:55.100> that<00:03:55.340> until<00:03:55.989> it

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
and you want to spray that until it
