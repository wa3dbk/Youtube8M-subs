00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
level now I know that if you love this

up you won't be getting combat levels

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.130 
up you won't be getting combat levels
after<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.859> evolution<00:00:20.279> combat<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.609> knew<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
after the evolution combat I knew that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.599 
after the evolution combat I knew that
since<00:00:22.140> they<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.710> released<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.340> knew<00:00:23.490> it

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
since they was released and I knew it

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
since they was released and I knew it
before<00:00:23.730> well<00:00:24.480> during<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.900> bit<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.199> well

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
before well during a bit as well

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.339 
before well during a bit as well
obviously<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.539> have<00:00:27.539> known<00:00:27.689> about<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.260> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
obviously so I have known about it but I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.890 
obviously so I have known about it but I
just<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.099> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> gone<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
just have not kind of gone it and the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.110 
just have not kind of gone it and the
reason<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.920> because<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.759> kind

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
reason for that is because that I kind

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.600 
reason for that is because that I kind
of<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> combat<00:00:33.989> well<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.070> these<00:00:35.309> two

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
of think of combat well that these two

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.790 
of think of combat well that these two
skills<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.149> still<00:00:36.480> kind<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.050> combat<00:00:37.530> based

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
skills are still kind of a combat based

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.190 
skills are still kind of a combat based
skill<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:38.579> am<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.210> much<00:00:39.600> fan<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
skill that i am not very much fan of a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.770 
skill that i am not very much fan of a
training<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.760> putting<00:00:42.510> me<00:00:42.690> in

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
training which is kind of putting me in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.290 
training which is kind of putting me in
quite<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> dilemma<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.300> me

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
quite a dilemma here because you know me

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.510 
quite a dilemma here because you know me
kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.930> associating<00:00:46.829> these<00:00:46.980> skills<00:00:47.280> with

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
kind of associating these skills with

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.790 
kind of associating these skills with
combat<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.239> don't<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:48.989> want<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.590> them

on it did give combat which is kind of
version<00:01:36.659> i<00:01:36.900> guess<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.350> few<00:01:37.560> people<00:01:37.619> did

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
version i guess because a few people did

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.170 
version i guess because a few people did
actually<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.369> ahead<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.610> train<00:01:38.970> they're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
actually go ahead and train they're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.420 
actually go ahead and train they're
