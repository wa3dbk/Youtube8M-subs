00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
beginning most of my trees have been

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.580 
beginning most of my trees have been
small<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> we've<00:00:15.780> let<00:00:15.960> them<00:00:16.109> grow<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.560> us

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
small and we've let them grow with us

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
small and we've let them grow with us
over<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> last<00:00:17.460> three<00:00:17.789> years<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.779> one's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
chocolate substitute and it was really

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.330 
chocolate substitute and it was really

interesting this morning on NP I heard a
10-minute<00:00:36.239> article<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.440> showcasing

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
10-minute article that was showcasing

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
how chocolate is endangered right now

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.840 
how chocolate is endangered right now
and<00:00:41.520> how<00:00:42.290> just<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.440> wine<00:00:43.739> certain<00:00:44.430> regions

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and how just like wine certain regions

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
and how just like wine certain regions
of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> earth<00:00:45.149> produce<00:00:45.840> higher<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.559> lower

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
of the earth produce higher or lower

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
of the earth produce higher or lower
quality<00:00:47.280> chocolate<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> Costa<00:00:48.780> Rica<00:00:48.809> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
quality chocolate and Costa Rica is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.540 
quality chocolate and Costa Rica is
producing<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:49.739> high<00:00:49.950> quality<00:00:50.010> chocolate

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
producing a very high quality chocolate

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.410 
producing a very high quality chocolate
but<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.680> whole<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.399> chocolate<00:00:53.760> industry<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
but as a whole the chocolate industry is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
but as a whole the chocolate industry is
on<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> decline<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.770> an

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
on the decline and is actually an

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.650 
on the decline and is actually an
endangered<00:00:56.010> industry<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> demand

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
endangered industry because the demand

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.740 
endangered industry because the demand
is<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.649> ability<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> produce

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
is up and the ability to produce

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.049 
is up and the ability to produce
abundant<00:01:00.750> chocolate<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> decline<00:01:02.250> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
abundant chocolate is on the decline so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.620 
abundant chocolate is on the decline so
maybe<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.600> alternative<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.439> carob<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.630> check

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
maybe an alternative is carob and check

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 
maybe an alternative is carob and check
this<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.900> right<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:07.490> there<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.580> male<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this out right here there is male and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.990 
this out right here there is male and
female<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> comes<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> carob<00:01:11.159> trees<00:01:11.460> I'm

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
female when it comes to carob trees I'm

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.530 
female when it comes to carob trees I'm
gonna<00:01:12.210> show<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> guys<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.189> female

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
gonna show you guys this is female

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.940 
gonna show you guys this is female
because<00:01:15.540> see<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.530> flowers

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
because see the way that these flowers

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.910 
because see the way that these flowers
look<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.850> each<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.060> these<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.920> tentacles

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
look so each of these little tentacles

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.600 
look so each of these little tentacles
will<00:01:20.880> become<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.600> carob<00:01:22.409> bean<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.369> they'll<00:01:23.520> be

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
will become a carob bean so they'll be

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.789 
will become a carob bean so they'll be
in<00:01:23.700> clusters<00:01:24.180> I'll<00:01:24.479> flash<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> picture<00:01:25.500> across

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
in clusters I'll flash a picture across

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.920 
in clusters I'll flash a picture across
the<00:01:25.979> screen<00:01:26.189> right<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.689> what

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the screen right now so you can see what

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.770 
the screen right now so you can see what
a<00:01:27.960> male<00:01:28.350> carob<00:01:29.009> flower<00:01:29.369> looks<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.689> as

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
a male carob flower looks like so as

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
a male carob flower looks like so as
long<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.079> there's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> male<00:01:31.710> carob<00:01:32.369> tree<00:01:32.729> within

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
long as there's a male carob tree within

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
long as there's a male carob tree within
a<00:01:33.450> mile<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.409> should<00:01:34.829> cross<00:01:35.070> pollinate

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
a mile of here it should cross pollinate

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520 
a mile of here it should cross pollinate
pretty<00:01:35.759> well<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:37.079> certain<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
pretty well and I'm certain that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.960 
pretty well and I'm certain that
somebody<00:01:37.799> has<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> carob<00:01:38.430> tree<00:01:38.610> somewhere

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
somebody has a carob tree somewhere

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460 
somebody has a carob tree somewhere
around<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.270> plus<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.110> over<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.350> hundred

around here plus we have over a hundred

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
around here plus we have over a hundred
trees<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:40.979> our<00:01:41.040> property<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:41.640> sure<00:01:41.820> something

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
trees on our property I'm sure something

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
trees on our property I'm sure something
will<00:01:42.390> happen<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:43.170> cross<00:01:43.409> pollinate<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.250> then

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
will happen to cross pollinate and then

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.420 
will happen to cross pollinate and then
the<00:01:44.790> other<00:01:44.909> tree<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.270> got<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.780> planted<00:01:46.140> oh
