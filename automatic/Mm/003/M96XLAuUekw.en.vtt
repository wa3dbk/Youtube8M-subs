00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 what's on my replacement iphone 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.779
 And why does iphone replace the experience of her 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.779

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.770

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.470
 It is the original golden of apple 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 with 16 gb I have another 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
 that's why I changed 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.650
 now here on the one hand cellphone bought because 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.040
 without a mobile phone is a bit bad 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.440
 Nowadays yes and now I show up 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.790
 the apps I so desperately need 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.890
 which I absolutely need to install again 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.079
 I had to be here now on the bazaar 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 cent you see the first page here 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 at least notes could be relatively empty 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.079
 but in any case we have here then 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.629
 the standard aps news calendar 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 photos camera safari notes weather music 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660
 app store 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.629
 then I have her whats app 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.340
 settings and savings app 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 telegram hd is something like whatsapp 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 and the youtube creator studio from there 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.309
 you can look at all the analytics 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.740
 from online videos to statistics and such 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.130
 I only have three things in the dock 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 and the podcast down there but thats 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.360
 behind it the background picture 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.670
 fits in a bit super front 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.150
 and for the golden iphone I'm super 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.369

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.850
 apps I have now installed 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.189
 I really need that, I say now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.799
 times we have despite facebook and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.430
 instagram guess everyone should know 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.320
 what is that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.590

 we have the friends app here 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.970
 We stalk our friends where to look 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.939
 they are straight I find personally 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.869
 Also important was not there in any case 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.960
 always handy to know where all 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.990
 Just then youtube app for youtube 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 videos watch the web so i can 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.789
 my light is everywhere in my room 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.590
 Switch off control no matter where I am 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.959
 we have the step counter off and me 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.890

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.110
 I was already very active today 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.800
 we have the app we can get one 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.100
 driver send private driver to us 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.430
 I'll say that kind of taxi 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.650
 costs as much and we will be with 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.500
 transported a bit more class 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.130
 So this is the Facebook Pages manager 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.240
 was somewhat unfortunately encapsulated was 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.940
 from foursquare 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.140
 but well the time we got there we can 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.670
 look what we especially where two or 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.370
 three years on twitter and facebook 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.620
 have posted site on the exact day 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.120
 I have to be relatively practical today 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.500

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 year would have tasted again 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.710
 somewhere such a shit then we have 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.490
 here my touchpen iab if that still 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.200
 You do not have to look into it 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.960
 description 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.900

 the folder here is the whole city 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.610
 I run apps but maps need 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.710
 more often so I was thinking is 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.890

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.380
 case can take me a picture there and 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.530
 then pixelate certain areas 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.540
 we do not want others to see 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.860

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.380

 where you think it does not matter 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.680
 but you get used to it and then 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:47.909

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.770
