this<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> first<00:00:17.609> glance<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.090> looks

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
this one is at a first glance it looks

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
this one is at a first glance it looks
like<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> very<00:00:18.539> evenly<00:00:18.900> matched<00:00:18.990> game<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.770> I'm

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
like a very evenly matched game and I'm

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890 
like a very evenly matched game and I'm
thinking<00:00:20.430> abut<00:00:20.880> Mississippi<00:00:21.270> State<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> six

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
thinking abut Mississippi State is a six

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900 
thinking abut Mississippi State is a six
and<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> half<00:00:22.109> point<00:00:22.500> favorite<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.820> know

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and a half point favorite and you know

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.279 
and a half point favorite and you know
you<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.300> Wake<00:00:24.420> Forest<00:00:24.449> Lake<00:00:24.900> farts<00:00:25.140> had<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
you look at Wake Forest Lake farts had a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.660 
you look at Wake Forest Lake farts had a
great<00:00:25.529> start<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.039> season<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.430> kind<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
great start to the season they kind of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.720 
great start to the season they kind of
faded<00:00:27.060> down<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> stretch<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.400> makes<00:00:29.580> me

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
faded down the stretch but that makes me

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.370 
faded down the stretch but that makes me
think<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.060> might<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.480> good<00:00:30.869> bet<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.230> an

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
think they might be a good bet as an

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.200 
think they might be a good bet as an
underdog<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> bowl<00:00:32.340> game<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:33.059> also

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
underdog here in the bowl game I'm also

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.520 
underdog here in the bowl game I'm also
kind<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.540> leading<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.960> over<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
kind of leading to the over here the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.840 
kind of leading to the over here the
total<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.190> reason<00:00:35.460> I'm<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.579> exactly

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
total for some reason I'm not exactly

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.250 
total for some reason I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:36.030> why<00:00:36.270> which<00:00:36.510> concerns<00:00:36.840> me<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> bit<00:00:37.050> but

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
sure why which concerns me a bit but

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.900 
sure why which concerns me a bit but
it's<00:00:37.410> 48<00:00:37.739> which<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.460> low<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it's 48 which is a little bit low I

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.880 
it's 48 which is a little bit low I
could<00:00:39.239> easily<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.690> both<00:00:39.989> teams<00:00:40.200> scoring<00:00:40.530> 24

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
could easily see both teams scoring 24

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.740 
could easily see both teams scoring 24

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
everything you say makes sense and the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
everything you say makes sense and the
the<00:00:55.949> spread<00:00:56.309> does<00:00:56.640> actually<00:00:57.090> jump<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.140> me

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

the spread does actually jump out at me
I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> had<00:00:59.699> any<00:00:59.789> cap<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.180> game<00:01:00.420> I

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
I think when I had any cap this game I

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
I think when I had any cap this game I
didn't<00:01:00.719> look<00:01:00.809> at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> spread<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.469> first<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.039> was

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
didn't look at the spread at first I was

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.820 
didn't look at the spread at first I was
surprised<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.270> seven<00:01:03.870> points<00:01:04.290> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
surprised to see that seven points it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530 
surprised to see that seven points it
looks<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.189> bit<00:01:05.400> fishy<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.240> least

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
looks a little bit fishy in at least

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
looks a little bit fishy in at least
make<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> case<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.170> why<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.950> Mississippi

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
clear head but the reason I like

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.859 
clear head but the reason I like
Mississippi<00:01:49.560> State<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> the

Mississippi State is because of the
rushing<00:01:51.869> offense<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.860> them<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.490> they're

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
rushing offense for them I think they're

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850 
rushing offense for them I think they're
going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.939> able<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.329> get<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> job

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
going to be able to get to get the job

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619

is<00:02:18.840> being<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.380> manageable<00:02:20.250> task<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:21.030> a

is being a manageable task for a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.940 
is being a manageable task for a
Mississippi<00:02:21.900> State<00:02:22.140> team<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.500> needs<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.800> run

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
Mississippi State team that needs to run

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.010 
Mississippi State team that needs to run
the<00:02:23.069> ball<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.400> win<00:02:23.580> against<00:02:24.300> those<00:02:24.569> types<00:02:24.900> of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the ball to win against those types of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.900 
the ball to win against those types of
teams<00:02:25.230> they<00:02:25.470> couldn't<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.610> spot<00:02:26.849> I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
teams they couldn't do it in this spot I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.150 
teams they couldn't do it in this spot I
think<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> play<00:02:28.290> from<00:02:28.560> ahead<00:02:28.890> I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
think they can do it play from ahead I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.979 
think they can do it play from ahead I
mean<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.459> their<00:02:29.730> style<00:02:30.090> they<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.810> to

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
mean this is their style they have to

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.660 
mean this is their style they have to
get<00:02:31.140> out<00:02:31.290> ahead<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.220> play<00:02:32.400> with<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
get out ahead they have to play with the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.760 
get out ahead they have to play with the
lead<00:02:32.850> they<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.780> milk<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.140> clock<00:02:34.290> hand

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
lead they have to milk the clock hand

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.979

the<00:02:34.890> ball<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.069> Vic<00:02:35.370> Balor<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.060> let<00:02:36.870> that

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
the ball to Vic Balor and let that

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.660 
the ball to Vic Balor and let that
defense<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.709> work<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.100> get<00:02:38.220> after<00:02:38.400> the

defense go to work and get after the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.790 
defense go to work and get after the
quarterback<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.690> see<00:02:39.930> them<00:02:40.140> being<00:02:40.319> able<00:02:40.680> to
