I think the most important aspect of
skating<00:01:34.190> for<00:01:34.400> me<00:01:34.550> is<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.470> social<00:01:36.470> experience

getting<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.310> know<00:01:46.490> what<00:01:46.790> motivates<00:01:46.970> them<00:01:47.630> what

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
getting to know what motivates them what

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.740
