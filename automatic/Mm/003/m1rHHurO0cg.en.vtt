00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.830
 chicken rolls in brick dough 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.900
 in this recipe we have used eight 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.510
 sheets of pasta brick 300 grams of 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.670
 breast that we have already roasted 150 grams of 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.800
 brie cheese an onion a spoonful of 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.099
 flour a glass of milk and salt 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.099
 nutmeg 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.790
 what we are going to do in the breast that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.280
 We have already suffered before without stopping 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.760
 a lot to half-cooked we're going to cut in 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.039
 squares 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.379
 more or less as you are seeing 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.250
 with the brie cheese we will remove the 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.250
 top cover 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.100
 and then with the help of a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.490
 spoon or teaspoon let's go pulling 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.750
 all the filling of this piece of cheese 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.940
 brie 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.030
 what we booked will be useful for later 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.769
 now let's support the onion too 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.799
 we already have it chopped we leave it there 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.259
 you go posing you stay transparent 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.220
 next we add the chicken that 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:15.220
 we had done before we cut and what 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.980
 we left there to sautÃ© like the two minutes 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.780
 once the time has passed we add a 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.780
 large spoonful of flour 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.280
 we incorporate a teaspoon of 2 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.290
 nutmeg 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.119
 and we're going to leave another couple of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.960
 minutes that the flour goes away suffering 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.909
 that go taking body 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.350
 already as if it were a bechamel we are going to 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.350
 add a glass of milk 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.330
 is going to weigh 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.040
 taking body and where we have it 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.040
 we add a tad of salt 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.280
 we put medium fire 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.660
 and we add the brie cheese later if 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.550
 You see, you are testing and if you see that 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.680
 You need a little more salt for you 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.680
 you can continue adding 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.830
 the one that goes up is a bit sticky 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.960
 but little by little we are adding everything 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.819
 the brie cheese that we have taken 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.879
 previously 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.910
 and we leave it there are another 5 or 6 minutes that 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.400
 is going to dissolve everything whole 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.830
 already we are going to do the filling with 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.360
 the stuffing we're going to throw it to any 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.710
 part inside the mass of the brick mass 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.660
 let's take like a couple of tablespoons 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.250
 big 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.530
 as you are seeing we have put a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.210
 little bit above the center and now 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.569
 we are going to double and do the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.239
 roll 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.829
 well with this roll now we close the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.469
 extremes that nothing comes out and what 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.090
 We take to the oven 5 minutes at 190 degrees 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.090
 previously we already have it hot 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.000
