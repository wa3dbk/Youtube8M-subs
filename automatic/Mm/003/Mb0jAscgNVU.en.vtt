00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.859
 Hi all 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.430
 in this week's recipe I'm going to 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:14.929
 teach how to make cookies with flour 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:23.869
 comprehensive and margarine and sugar eggs 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:26.329
 cane because since every day there is more 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.230
 cases of intolerance and intolerance to 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.180
 yeast to the refined flours to 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.850
 things 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.340
 as in my case in my case I can not 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.820
 take neither yeast nor lactose nor flour 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.400
 refined then I invented these 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.400
 biscuits cookies 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.609
 without them all without refined flours and 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.960
 yeast costs a lot they are found 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.109
 they are very difficult to find in 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.210
 pharmacy or specialized store and 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.859
 So, well, I made a series of 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.839
 tests I have tried with various flours 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.839
 such as sweet potato flour oatmeal 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.940
 but I've seen that wholemeal flour 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.730
 since there is no leaven left, there remains a 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.500
 bit more reliable the cookie is a 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:22.240
 little bit more reliable is not so hard 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.229
 and well the ingredients you have already seen 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.960
 for 3 eggs 125 grams of margarine or 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.970
 if you prefer 125 grams of butter or 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.420
 margarine or butter depends on the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.799
 intolerance that you have and 3 tablespoons 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.340
 tureens of cane sugar or sugar 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.340
 Brown 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.940
 we mix well in a bowl and margarine 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.560
 I practically left it out 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.220
 out of the refrigerator for a few 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.340
 how many hours of way is it so is 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.340
 well blanditas and is easy to work 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.110
 we started mixing 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.170
 and then we add 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.170
 the flour and when the dough of it 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.900
 he starts to take off from the bowl he wants 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.390
 say that you are ready to knead 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.930
 hand and be able to prepare the shape of 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.930
 cookies 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.790
 well we are mixing as soon as 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.870
 ready to store by hand we said 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.020
 the amount of flour flour half a kilo 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.440
 it's enough for eggs that 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.490
 come I was the amount of eggs and of 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.590
 margarine but it usually depends 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.510
 always of the margarine and the eggs and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.730
 they are bigger or smaller 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.730
 sure enough kilo 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.890
 or not 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.450
 two 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.910
 if it is a bit sticky it will go 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:05.460
 adding flour 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.050
 as it is taking off 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.050
 you are working 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.249
 you have to work it in a way that does not 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.650
 It is also not very fluid because if not the 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:21.810
 biscuit truly then it remains 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.980
 pretty hard and it's not the case 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.880
 being unleavened cookies that happens 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:35.250
 that when you go to the wet in the coffee 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.820
 in the tea because they do not fall apart because they 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.820
 they are quite 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.840
 if they are quite impermeable to not 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.760
 carry the yeast are more cookies 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.630
 suitable for eating 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.200
 that accompany the tee to make a 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.200
 is next 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.090
 I had calculated half a kilo of flour 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.090
 and it seems that 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.349
 we will not have problems 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.630
 then with rolling pin 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.630
 will 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.490
 a kind 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.420
 circle 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.090
 I need flour 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:35.250
 now let's roll the dough when and 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.510
 you see that our fingers do not stick 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.510
 worked pretty well 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:46.250
 let's go with the roller we start here 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.810
 I have a work surface 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.260
 pretty small a webby a little bit 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.220
 great but good 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.380
 ah 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.380
 will serve for the next kitchen 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.439
 and we're going to leave them at a height of 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.439
 to half a centimeter 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.439
 true 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.319
 and the still good, well, if you have shapes 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.230
 to make the cookies the molds that 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:26.180
 sell you can do things with a 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:31.380
 with the diameter of a cup of a cup 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.440
 I do not use the coffee ramp with the dough 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.980
 extended 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.300
 with a thickness of half a centimeter 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.300
 let's go with him 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.529
 you help as you prefer with the 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:49.859
 mold that one wants to invent 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:53.789
 we are making cookies while 

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:56.969
 so we prepare the oven the oven 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:59.339
 intended electric I say cooking 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:04.499
 of my oven electric ventilated oven to 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:06.720
 190 degrees in 15 minutes I can put the 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:08.790
 two trays 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:14.120
 they are cooked at the same time 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.120
 at 15 minutes you have the cookies ready 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.520
 Well, you have the cookies here 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:32.160
 whole warm cooked 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.410
 of the last three you leave them 1 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.629
 minute more 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.500
 a little grilled to lend a 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:39.500
 little more above 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:46.409
 ahead if there's a little bit more candy 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.719
 well also before making them known 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:50.909
 Once the vein of the ways you can 

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:53.999
 prepare on a plate a little sugar or 

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:57.330
 of cane or if you prefer normal sugar and 

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:59.779
 wet the sugar then then 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.669
 cooking that sugar will be stuck 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:06.150
 will be completely adhered I have 

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:07.949
 made completely dietary in all 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.539
 the senses carry a little sugar 

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:12.520
 how can you have the ingredients 

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:15.220
 that I describe below 

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.639
 Greetings to all and see you next time 

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.639
 recipe
