slightly coarse not completely unlike a
knife<00:00:49.829> sharpening<00:00:50.280> stone<00:00:52.399> because<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
knife sharpening stone because we have a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.579 
knife sharpening stone because we have a
variety<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> acids<00:00:54.749> to<00:00:54.899> use<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.260> won't<00:00:55.469> be

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
variety of acids to use we won't be

variety of acids to use we won't be
needing<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.249> testing<00:00:56.699> needles<00:00:57.199> shown

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.709 
needing the little testing needles shown
here<00:00:58.729> what<00:00:59.729> I<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.089> front<00:01:00.269> of<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.659> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
here what I have in front of me is a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.100 
here what I have in front of me is a
white<00:01:01.050> ring<00:01:01.319> not<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:02.159> what<00:01:02.339> metal<00:01:02.639> it<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.110> but

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
white ring not sure what metal it is but

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.649 
white ring not sure what metal it is but
I'm<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> put<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> scratch<00:01:05.190> test<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.299> here

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
I'm going to put a scratch test on here

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.360 
I'm going to put a scratch test on here
so<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.409> test<00:01:07.620> it<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> couple<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
so we can test it for a couple of

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.280 
so we can test it for a couple of
different<00:01:08.640> materials<00:01:09.620> once<00:01:10.790> twice<00:01:12.290> three

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
different materials once twice three

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.800 
different materials once twice three
times<00:01:13.790> four<00:01:14.790> times<00:01:15.080> five<00:01:16.080> times<00:01:20.450> because<00:01:21.450> this

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
times four times five times because this

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
times four times five times because this
is<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> white<00:01:22.230> metal<00:01:22.490> someone<00:01:23.490> might<00:01:23.640> be

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
is a white metal someone might be

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.690 
is a white metal someone might be
thinking<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.210> platinum<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
thinking it's platinum so we get the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
thinking it's platinum so we get the
Platinum<00:01:27.060> solution<00:01:27.540> out<00:01:29.570> carefully<00:01:30.570> take<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
Platinum solution out carefully take the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
Platinum solution out carefully take the
cap<00:01:31.170> off<00:01:33.410> just<00:01:34.410> put<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.620> drop<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.990> one<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
cap off just put a drop of one of the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.260 
cap off just put a drop of one of the
traces

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.590 

and<00:01:40.810> I'll<00:01:40.960> see<00:01:41.140> what<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.409> reaction<00:01:41.680> is<00:01:41.890> like

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.330 

cap<00:01:46.600> back<00:01:46.810> on<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:50.560> can<00:01:50.740> see<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.100> trace

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
cap back on and we can see that trace

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.260 
cap back on and we can see that trace
dissolved<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.119> we<00:01:52.240> know<00:01:52.360> it's<00:01:52.540> not<00:01:52.689> platinum

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
dissolved so we know it's not platinum

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.080 
dissolved so we know it's not platinum
let's<00:01:55.270> see<00:01:55.509> if<00:01:56.220> because<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.369> its<00:01:57.520> color<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:58.030> know

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
let's see if because of its color I know

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.870 
let's see if because of its color I know
it<00:01:58.390> won't<00:01:58.600> be<00:01:58.810> 22<00:01:59.409> karat<00:01:59.740> gold<00:01:59.950> there<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.159> no<00:02:00.280> 22

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it won't be 22 karat gold there is no 22

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.760 
it won't be 22 karat gold there is no 22
karat<00:02:01.179> white<00:02:01.299> gold<00:02:01.360> let's<00:02:02.170> see<00:02:02.380> if<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.619> might

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
karat white gold let's see if it might

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:14.550 
karat white gold let's see if it might
be<00:02:02.830> 18<00:02:03.580> karat<00:02:03.939> gold<00:02:12.120> again<00:02:13.120> we<00:02:13.269> put<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> cap

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
be 18 karat gold again we put the cap

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.670 
be 18 karat gold again we put the cap
carefully<00:02:15.310> back<00:02:15.489> on<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.390> we<00:02:16.989> see<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.410> trace

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
carefully back on and we see that trace

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.059 
carefully back on and we see that trace
also<00:02:18.130> has<00:02:18.310> dissolved<00:02:19.110> next<00:02:20.110> let's<00:02:20.680> see<00:02:20.860> if<00:02:20.950> it

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
also has dissolved next let's see if it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.220 
also has dissolved next let's see if it
might<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.280> 14<00:02:21.910> karat<00:02:22.239> gold<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:28.720> resolved

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
might be 14 karat gold and is resolved

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.580 
might be 14 karat gold and is resolved
immediately<00:02:30.780> we've<00:02:31.780> gotten<00:02:32.049> just<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.350> little

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
immediately we've gotten just a little

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.050 
immediately we've gotten just a little
dust<00:02:32.799> from<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> inside<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.580> box<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.000> not

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
dust from the inside of the box it's not

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.270 
dust from the inside of the box it's not
important<00:02:34.600> let's<00:02:35.470> see<00:02:35.620> if<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.830> 10<00:02:36.040> karat

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
important let's see if it's 10 karat

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:46.349 
important let's see if it's 10 karat
gold<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:45.370> we'll<00:02:45.730> give<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.060> couple<00:02:46.269> of

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
gold and we'll give it a couple of

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.060 
gold and we'll give it a couple of
minutes<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:50.079> we<00:02:50.200> can<00:02:50.380> see<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.739> that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
minutes and we can see now that that

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.270 
minutes and we can see now that that
trace<00:02:51.370> also<00:02:51.910> has<00:02:52.180> dissolved<00:02:53.140> our<00:02:53.350> conclusion

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
into the other scratch next to it so I

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.080

when<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.650> doubt<00:04:25.830> check<00:04:26.520> again<00:04:31.190> one<00:04:32.190> more

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340

a drop on there I'm confident that this

to buy this as scrap I would buy it as

10 karat
