00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
I heard hiding with Jonathan now you

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.500 
I heard hiding with Jonathan now you
guys<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.560> working<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.429> always<00:00:09.240> new

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
guys are working on always new

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.060 
guys are working on always new
technology<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.410> know<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.650> there's<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> lot

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
technology you know this there's a lot

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.470 
technology you know this there's a lot
of<00:00:11.099> familiar<00:00:11.519> technology<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.120> there<00:00:12.150> got

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
of familiar technology out there got

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.550 
of familiar technology out there got
tungsten<00:00:12.900> LED<00:00:13.380> fluorescent<00:00:14.360> HMI<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:16.199> plasma

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
tungsten LED fluorescent HMI but plasma

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.870 
tungsten LED fluorescent HMI but plasma
is<00:00:16.680> still<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> new<00:00:16.980> technology<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> remember

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
is still a new technology I remember

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.250 
is still a new technology I remember
talking<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.330> four<00:00:18.539> years<00:00:18.690> ago<00:00:18.810> about<00:00:19.199> it

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
talking to you four years ago about it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.080 
talking to you four years ago about it
you<00:00:19.710> guys<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.010> been<00:00:20.130> developing<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.850> really

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you guys have been developing and really

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.939 
you guys have been developing and really
perfecting<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.109> introducing<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
perfecting it and introducing it to the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
perfecting it and introducing it to the
market<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.490> constantly<00:00:24.210> bringing<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> price

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
market and constantly bringing the price

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
market and constantly bringing the price
point<00:00:24.960> down<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.680> attainable<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
point down so it's more attainable to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.980 
point down so it's more attainable to
the<00:00:26.670> average<00:00:26.760> shooter<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.630> guys<00:00:27.779> have

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the average shooter you guys have

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.240 
the average shooter you guys have
introducing<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> brand<00:00:28.650> new<00:00:28.830> product<00:00:29.070> that

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
introducing a brand new product that

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.890 
introducing a brand new product that
again<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.939> bringing<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> price<00:00:30.539> point<00:00:30.810> for

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
again is bringing the price point for

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.380 
again is bringing the price point for
plasma<00:00:31.289> letting<00:00:31.590> into<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> whole<00:00:32.040> new<00:00:32.070> market

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
plasma letting into a whole new market

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.850 
plasma letting into a whole new market
absolutely<00:00:33.390> yeah<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.780> plasma<00:00:34.410> lighting<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
absolutely yeah so plasma lighting is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.590 
absolutely yeah so plasma lighting is
really<00:00:34.890> best<00:00:35.340> thought<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.090> energy

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
really best thought of as the energy

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600 
really best thought of as the energy
efficiencies<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> LEDs<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> high<00:00:38.399> output

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
efficiencies of LEDs but the high output

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
efficiencies of LEDs but the high output
daylight<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.719> HMI<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.770> we're

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
daylight of an HMI but what we're

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.979 
daylight of an HMI but what we're
introducing<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.670> NAB<00:00:41.940> 2014<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> our<00:00:42.840> new

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
introducing here at NAB 2014 is our new

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.990 
introducing here at NAB 2014 is our new
high<00:00:43.200> V<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.219> B<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.670> exciting

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
high V and the B is a really exciting

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.520 
high V and the B is a really exciting
light<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.329> us<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.600> an<00:00:45.690> open-faced<00:00:46.230> style

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
light for us it's an open-faced style

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.860 
light for us it's an open-faced style
light<00:00:46.800> gives<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> hundred<00:00:47.730> degree<00:00:48.030> flood

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
light gives you a hundred degree flood

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
light gives you a hundred degree flood
field<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:50.039> sort<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> very<00:00:50.670> similar<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
field which sort of is very similar to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.209 
field which sort of is very similar to
your<00:00:51.420> 1k<00:00:51.840> open-faced<00:00:52.379> tungsten<00:00:52.890> big

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
your 1k open-faced tungsten big

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
your 1k open-faced tungsten big
difference<00:00:53.550> obviously<00:00:53.670> being<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.539> low

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
difference obviously being very low

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
difference obviously being very low
power<00:00:54.899> draw<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> only<00:00:55.469> pulls<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.949> 275<00:00:56.640> wats<00:00:56.969> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
power draw it only pulls to 275 wats so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.700 
power draw it only pulls to 275 wats so
you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.360> plug<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.660> number<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.230> them<00:00:58.320> safely

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you can plug a number of them safely

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
you can plug a number of them safely
into<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> wall<00:00:59.280> socket<00:00:59.309> also<00:01:00.180> give<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> 10,000

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
into a wall socket also give a 10,000

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.060 
into a wall socket also give a 10,000
hour<00:01:00.930> bulb<00:01:01.170> life<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:01.590> vibration

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
hour bulb life that's vibration

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
hour bulb life that's vibration
resistance<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.730> you're<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> have

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
resistance so you're not going to have

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.000 
resistance so you're not going to have
bulbs<00:01:03.570> popping<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.739> there's<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
bulbs popping on you then there's the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.380 
bulbs popping on you then there's the
significant<00:01:05.460> reduction<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> heat<00:01:06.150> which<00:01:06.360> is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
significant reduction of heat which is

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
significant reduction of heat which is
really<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.840> big<00:01:07.200> deal<00:01:07.229> both<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.740> terms<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
really a big deal both in terms of the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
really a big deal both in terms of the
your<00:01:08.250> workflow<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> shooter<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.299> also<00:01:09.420> for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
your workflow as a shooter but also for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
your workflow as a shooter but also for
the<00:01:09.689> talent<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.530> screen

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the talent that you have on screen

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
the talent that you have on screen
especially<00:01:11.310> we're<00:01:11.640> doing<00:01:11.880> small<00:01:12.150> interviews

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
especially we're doing small interviews

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
especially we're doing small interviews
and<00:01:12.900> tight<00:01:13.049> spaces<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and tight spaces you're not going to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
and tight spaces you're not going to
heat<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.400> office<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> apartment<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
heat up that office that apartment that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.990 
heat up that office that apartment that
that<00:01:16.470> building<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> came<00:01:17.159> into<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.759> sort

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that building that you came into as sort

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
that building that you came into as sort
of<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> guest<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.200> feel<00:01:19.350> very

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
of a guest but you now can feel very

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.630 
of a guest but you now can feel very
comfortable<00:01:19.650> they're<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> clean

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
comfortable they're going to clean

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
comfortable they're going to clean
high-quality<00:01:21.540> light<00:01:21.750> without<00:01:22.110> making<00:01:22.470> anyone

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
high-quality light without making anyone

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.109 
high-quality light without making anyone
uncomfortable<00:01:22.850> finally<00:01:23.850> they're<00:01:24.000> also

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
uncomfortable finally they're also

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.760 
uncomfortable finally they're also
flicker-free<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:25.200> depending<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.680> your

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
flicker-free which depending on your

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.990 
flicker-free which depending on your
shooting<00:01:26.040> applications<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.939> useful

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
shooting applications can be very useful

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.929 
shooting applications can be very useful
it's<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.290> by<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.650> size<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.820> actually

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it's a one by one size but it actually

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.700 
it's a one by one size but it actually
gives<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.420> five<00:01:30.750> times<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> output<00:01:31.680> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
gives you at five times the output of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
gives you at five times the output of
say<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.310> by<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.640> LED<00:01:33.060> panel<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.020> also

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
say a one by one LED panel it's also

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
say a one by one LED panel it's also
very<00:01:34.470> similar<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.189> some<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.549> brighter

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
very similar to some of your brighter

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.660 
very similar to some of your brighter
and<00:01:36.060> bigger<00:01:36.240> fluorescent<00:01:37.140> units<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.070> one

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and bigger fluorescent units and one

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.859 
and bigger fluorescent units and one
thing<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> knows<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> quality<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
thing I knows to the quality of the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.179 
thing I knows to the quality of the
light<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.170> very<00:01:40.439> smooth<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
light it's very smooth you know when you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
light it's very smooth you know when you
get<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> panel<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.750> these<00:01:42.930> tiny<00:01:43.140> sources

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
get a panel it's all these tiny sources

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
get a panel it's all these tiny sources
and<00:01:43.979> diffuse<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> try<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.149> rid<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and diffuse that try to get rid of the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.880 
and diffuse that try to get rid of the
sources<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:46.259> you're<00:01:46.380> getting<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
sources now you're getting down the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.160 
sources now you're getting down the
intensity<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.850> by<00:01:47.970> having<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.329> smooth<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
intensity so by having a smooth and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.389 
intensity so by having a smooth and
natural<00:01:49.229> light<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.799> coming<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.130> source

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
natural light just coming out of source

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.649 
natural light just coming out of source
you<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.270> worry<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.540> getting

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you don't have to worry about getting

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.460 
you don't have to worry about getting
those<00:01:51.960> multiple<00:01:52.290> she

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
those multiple she

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.620 
those multiple she
yeah<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> quality<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> light<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.540> one

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
yeah the quality of light is really one

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
yeah the quality of light is really one
of<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.720> great<00:01:54.900> advantages<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.410> plasma<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of the great advantages of plasma it's a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
of the great advantages of plasma it's a
single<00:01:56.400> point<00:01:56.580> source<00:01:56.880> bulb<00:01:57.510> so<00:01:57.720> it's<00:01:57.870> much

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
single point source bulb so it's much

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.300 
single point source bulb so it's much
more<00:01:58.050> similar<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.650> our<00:01:58.740> actual<00:01:59.070> direct

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
more similar to our actual direct

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.680 
more similar to our actual direct
daylight<00:01:59.640> or<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.120> tungsten<00:02:00.330> incandescent

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
daylight or the tungsten incandescent

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.230 
daylight or the tungsten incandescent
bulbs<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.680> love<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.040> much<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
bulbs we love so much and so you have a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.210 
bulbs we love so much and so you have a
single<00:02:03.570> point<00:02:03.750> source<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.200> clean<00:02:04.470> crisp<00:02:04.890> shadow

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
single point source a clean crisp shadow

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.070 
single point source a clean crisp shadow
but<00:02:05.790> also<00:02:05.910> a<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.240> beautiful<00:02:06.360> quality<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
but also a really beautiful quality of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.330 
but also a really beautiful quality of
full<00:02:07.320> spectrum<00:02:07.710> daylight<00:02:08.070> so<00:02:08.160> you're<00:02:08.280> not

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
full spectrum daylight so you're not

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.400 
full spectrum daylight so you're not
gonna<00:02:08.460> have<00:02:08.580> any<00:02:08.700> green<00:02:08.940> magenta<00:02:09.330> shift<00:02:10.170> or

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
gonna have any green magenta shift or

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.020 
gonna have any green magenta shift or
spike<00:02:10.710> that<00:02:10.920> you'll<00:02:11.040> see<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.400> certain<00:02:11.670> LEDs

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
spike that you'll see with certain LEDs

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
spike that you'll see with certain LEDs
it's<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.840> actually<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> very<00:02:13.320> warm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's going to have actually a very warm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.590 
it's going to have actually a very warm
pleasing<00:02:14.010> tone<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.580> actually<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
pleasing tone and actually that it a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.670 
pleasing tone and actually that it a
feature<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.870> we're<00:02:16.080> really<00:02:16.200> excited<00:02:16.470> about

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
feature that we're really excited about

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.770 
feature that we're really excited about
which<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.490> tunable<00:02:18.060> daylight<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.660> what

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
which is the tunable daylight and what

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.120 
which is the tunable daylight and what
we<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:18.960> do<00:02:19.050> with<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> tunable<00:02:19.590> daylight<00:02:19.950> is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
we can do with the tunable daylight is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.560 
we can do with the tunable daylight is
basically<00:02:20.430> shift<00:02:20.670> all<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.910> way<00:02:21.000> from<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.240> forty

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
basically shift all the way from a forty

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.360 
basically shift all the way from a forty
eight<00:02:21.660> hundred<00:02:21.930> Kelvin<00:02:22.260> down<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> 6500

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
eight hundred Kelvin down to a 6500

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.330 
eight hundred Kelvin down to a 6500
Kelvin<00:02:24.120> obviously<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.200> 5600<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> middle

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
Kelvin obviously with 5600 in the middle

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.860 
Kelvin obviously with 5600 in the middle
that<00:02:26.640> allows<00:02:26.910> us<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.270> sort<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.450> match<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
that allows us to sort of match the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.270 
that allows us to sort of match the
daylight<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.320> might<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.620> finding<00:02:29.010> during<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
daylight we might be finding during the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.830 
daylight we might be finding during the
course<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> day<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.450> give<00:02:30.570> either

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
course of the day or just to give either

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.930 
course of the day or just to give either
a<00:02:30.990> cooler<00:02:31.320> or<00:02:31.620> warmer<00:02:31.680> feel<00:02:32.370> depending<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:32.910> our

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
a cooler or warmer feel depending on our

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.400 
a cooler or warmer feel depending on our
choices<00:02:33.270> are<00:02:33.630> creative<00:02:34.050> choices<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
choices are creative choices and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
choices are creative choices and
aesthetic<00:02:34.770> desires<00:02:35.070> will<00:02:35.850> take<00:02:36.000> us<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
aesthetic desires will take us to the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.210 
aesthetic desires will take us to the
fixture<00:02:36.690> how<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.230> sets<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.860> how<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.100> used

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
fixture how it sets up and how it's used

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.070 
fixture how it sets up and how it's used
sure<00:02:38.760> absolutely<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.450> basically<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.020> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
sure absolutely so basically have a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.680 
sure absolutely so basically have a
fixture<00:02:40.320> here<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.700> as<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.300> see<00:02:42.510> it's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
fixture here it's a as you can see it's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.470 
fixture here it's a as you can see it's
sort<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.050> one<00:02:43.560> by<00:02:43.709> one<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.040> thicker<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:45.270> has

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
sort of a one by one but thicker it has

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.110 
sort of a one by one but thicker it has
the<00:02:45.690> bulb<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> has<00:02:46.890> drop-in<00:02:47.459> accessories

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the bulb here it has drop-in accessories

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.090 
the bulb here it has drop-in accessories
so<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.690> can<00:02:48.810> use<00:02:48.930> standard<00:02:49.320> 170<00:02:49.920> millimeters

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
so you can use standard 170 millimeters

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.830 
so you can use standard 170 millimeters
six<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.790> five<00:02:50.910> eighths<00:02:51.060> accessories<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.720> your

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
six and five eighths accessories so your

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.120 
six and five eighths accessories so your

to<00:03:28.290> run<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.590> there's<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.980> great<00:03:29.160> advantage

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
to run it there's a great advantage

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.039 
to run it there's a great advantage
especially<00:03:29.790> if<00:03:30.299> you're<00:03:30.510> going<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.900> doing

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
especially if you're going to be doing

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.600 
especially if you're going to be doing
running<00:03:31.320> guns<00:03:31.560> stuff<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:32.160> don't<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.430> time

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
running guns stuff you don't have time

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.580 
running guns stuff you don't have time
to<00:03:32.760> find<00:03:32.970> multiple<00:03:33.600> power<00:03:33.780> sources<00:03:34.049> but<00:03:34.410> if

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
to find multiple power sources but if

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.259 
to find multiple power sources but if
you're<00:03:34.680> working<00:03:34.799> outside<00:03:35.190> where<00:03:35.820> this

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
you're working outside where this

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.850 
you're working outside where this
daylight<00:03:36.630> option<00:03:37.140> really<00:03:37.440> does<00:03:37.590> shine

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
daylight option really does shine

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.830 
daylight option really does shine
finally<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:38.970> your<00:03:39.120> color<00:03:39.330> tuning<00:03:39.690> wheel

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
finally you have your color tuning wheel

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.750 
finally you have your color tuning wheel
so<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> back<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.920> this<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.160> have<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.310> tuning

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
so on the back of this you have a tuning

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.449 
so on the back of this you have a tuning
wheel<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.090> shows<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.620> 4850<00:03:43.620> 600<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
wheel that shows you a 4850 600 and a

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.940 
wheel that shows you a 4850 600 and a
6500<00:03:44.970> position<00:03:45.570> in<00:03:45.989> between<00:03:46.410> those<00:03:46.620> you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
6500 position in between those you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.770 
6500 position in between those you
actually<00:03:47.250> are<00:03:47.400> able<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.820> tune<00:03:48.030> throughout<00:03:48.570> the

actually are able to tune throughout the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.720 
actually are able to tune throughout the
entire<00:03:49.049> Kelvin<00:03:49.530> scale<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.190> it's<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.430> fixed

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
entire Kelvin scale so it's not a fixed

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.250 
entire Kelvin scale so it's not a fixed
positions<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.269> actually<00:03:51.510> are<00:03:51.660> able<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:52.110> push

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
positions we actually are able to push

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.500 
positions we actually are able to push
it<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.410> little<00:03:52.440> bit<00:03:52.739> warmer<00:03:53.430> than<00:03:53.610> 4,800<00:03:54.360> a

it a little bit warmer than 4,800 a
little<00:03:54.810> bit<00:03:54.900> cooler<00:03:55.170> than<00:03:55.290> 6500<00:03:56.010> we<00:03:56.310> just

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
little bit cooler than 6500 we just

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.710 
little bit cooler than 6500 we just
recommend<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.850> as<00:03:57.000> being<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.269> area<00:03:57.540> where

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
recommend that as being the area where

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.390 
recommend that as being the area where
you<00:03:57.959> still<00:03:58.200> get<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> full<00:03:58.620> spectrum<00:03:59.040> clean

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
you still get a full spectrum clean

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.890 
you still get a full spectrum clean
white<00:03:59.700> light<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.630> slightly

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
different character finally though we

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.500 
different character finally though we
did<00:04:03.180> add<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> moonlight<00:04:03.780> all<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.290> way

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
did add a moonlight all the way

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.509 
did add a moonlight all the way

obviously<00:04:09.670> that's<00:04:09.790> more<00:04:09.939> of<00:04:10.030> an<00:04:10.150> aesthetic

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
obviously that's more of an aesthetic

obviously that's more of an aesthetic

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
cutting down in the output at that time

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.640 
cutting down in the output at that time
to<00:04:24.729> exactly<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:25.510> what<00:04:26.020> price<00:04:26.169> point<00:04:26.229> is<00:04:26.560> is

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
to exactly so what price point is is

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.129 
to exactly so what price point is is
coming<00:04:26.949> in<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.460> head<00:04:27.610> itself<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:28.060> 1995<00:04:28.780> and

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
coming in so the head itself is 1995 and

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.150 
coming in so the head itself is 1995 and
then<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.350> start<00:04:29.560> having<00:04:29.620> your<00:04:29.889> different

then you start having your different

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.550 
then you start having your different
accessory<00:04:30.550> options<00:04:31.110> for<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.169> power<00:04:32.350> supply

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
accessory options for the power supply

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.590 
accessory options for the power supply
that's<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.130> simplest<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.090> cheapest<00:04:34.449> was

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
that's the simplest and the cheapest was

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.810 
that's the simplest and the cheapest was
the<00:04:34.780> AC<00:04:34.930> it's<00:04:35.229> 495<00:04:35.860> so<00:04:36.160> basically<00:04:36.490> for<00:04:36.550> about

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
the AC it's 495 so basically for about

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.159 
the AC it's 495 so basically for about
twenty-five<00:04:37.150> hundred<00:04:37.240> dollars<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.020> walk

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.060 
really top color quality so like for HMI
lighting<00:05:38.979> you<00:05:39.130> know<00:05:39.220> it's<00:05:39.580> it's<00:05:40.060> finicky<00:05:40.479> and

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
lighting you know it's it's finicky and

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.890 
lighting you know it's it's finicky and
it<00:05:42.070> is<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.580> still<00:05:42.820> expensive<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.570> you<00:05:43.690> have<00:05:43.810> to

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
it is it still expensive and you have to

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.939 
it is it still expensive and you have to
deal<00:05:44.020> with<00:05:44.110> Dallas<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.620> stuff<00:05:44.770> like<00:05:44.889> that

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
deal with Dallas and stuff like that

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.770 
deal with Dallas and stuff like that
what<00:05:45.580> like<00:05:45.910> what<00:05:46.120> kind<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.360> pics<00:05:46.570> you<00:05:46.630> were

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
what like what kind of pics you were

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.540 
what like what kind of pics you were
this<00:05:46.930> equivalent<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.710> few<00:05:47.889> were<00:05:47.949> to<00:05:48.070> get<00:05:48.190> it

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
this equivalent to a few were to get it

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.270 
this equivalent to a few were to get it
sure<00:05:49.330> absolutely<00:05:49.510> so<00:05:50.020> our<00:05:50.530> wasp<00:05:50.740> plasma<00:05:51.100> far

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
sure absolutely so our wasp plasma far

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.890 
sure absolutely so our wasp plasma far
is<00:05:51.370> really<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.670> equivalent<00:05:51.730> of<00:05:52.150> a<00:05:52.270> 400<00:05:52.870> watt

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
is really the equivalent of a 400 watt

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.250 
is really the equivalent of a 400 watt
HMI<00:05:53.830> par<00:05:54.190> lamp<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.760> so<00:05:55.360> for<00:05:55.690> a<00:05:55.720> lot<00:05:55.900> of<00:05:55.960> those

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
HMI par lamp and so for a lot of those
