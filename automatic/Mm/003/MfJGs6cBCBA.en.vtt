00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
definitely recommend using a knowledge

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.410 
definitely recommend using a knowledge
ility<00:02:38.260> if<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.770> not<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.220> 99<00:02:39.790> already<00:02:40.209> as

used on wood cutting if you want

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.710 
used on wood cutting if you want
although<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.730> really<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:46.150> depends<00:02:46.450> how<00:02:46.570> much

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
although it really just depends how much

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.380 
although it really just depends how much
time<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> day<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.440> have<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:48.520> know<00:02:48.640> or<00:02:48.880> how

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
time of the day you have you know or how

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.670

often<00:02:49.600> you're<00:02:49.900> on<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.080> computer<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.590> play

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
often you're on the computer to play

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.010 
often you're on the computer to play
runescape<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.489> definitely<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.270> my<00:02:52.450> opinion<00:02:52.750> if

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
runescape so definitely in my opinion if

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.840 
runescape so definitely in my opinion if
you<00:02:53.110> don't<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.410> known<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.709> our<00:02:53.770> agility<00:02:54.100> I'd

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
you don't have known in our agility I'd

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.050 
you don't have known in our agility I'd
recommend<00:02:55.270> using<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.080> agility<00:02:56.830> okay<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:57.850> as

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
recommend using it on agility okay so as

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.920 
recommend using it on agility okay so as
far<00:02:58.570> as<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.620> haiti<00:03:00.280> pause<00:03:00.790> which<00:03:01.300> are<00:03:01.540> for

far as the the haiti pause which are for

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.260 
far as the the haiti pause which are for
all<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.830> combat<00:03:03.190> skills<00:03:03.520> except<00:03:04.060> for

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
prayer and summoning i'm probably going

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.610

to<00:03:06.220> use<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.489> on<00:03:06.640> ranged<00:03:07.270> or<00:03:07.510> magic<00:03:07.959> just

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
to use it on ranged or magic just

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.490 
to use it on ranged or magic just
because<00:03:08.980> um<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:10.060> don't<00:03:10.870> know<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.230> like

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
because um I don't know I just like

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.199 
because um I don't know I just like
