no look at it I'll Shaun Geoffrey if

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.320 
no look at it I'll Shaun Geoffrey if
only<00:06:43.259> he<00:06:43.470> was<00:06:43.590> able<00:06:43.740> to<00:06:43.949> like<00:06:44.099> extend<00:06:45.030> the<00:06:45.150> ball

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
only he was able to like extend the ball

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.790 
only he was able to like extend the ball
out<00:06:45.539> if<00:06:45.690> they<00:06:45.810> had<00:06:45.900> like<00:06:46.020> a<00:06:46.080> feature<00:06:46.319> like<00:06:46.590> that

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
out if they had like a feature like that

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.010 
out if they had like a feature like that
in<00:06:46.949> this<00:06:47.039> game<00:06:47.160> but<00:06:48.090> obviously<00:06:48.360> a<00:06:48.720> great

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
in this game but obviously a great

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.290 
in this game but obviously a great
tackle<00:06:49.710> by<00:06:49.800> my<00:06:49.949> opponent<00:06:50.220> out<00:06:50.460> I<00:06:50.669> was<00:06:50.970> thinking

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
tackle by my opponent out I was thinking

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.290 
tackle by my opponent out I was thinking
about<00:06:51.419> passing<00:06:52.080> it<00:06:52.169> towards<00:06:52.699> toilolo<00:06:53.699> on<00:06:54.090> this

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
about passing it towards toilolo on this

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.450 
about passing it towards toilolo on this
play<00:06:54.569> I<00:06:54.840> mean<00:06:55.319> it<00:06:55.409> looks<00:06:55.560> like<00:06:55.740> he<00:06:55.919> was<00:06:56.039> open

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
play I mean it looks like he was open

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.180 
play I mean it looks like he was open
but<00:06:56.639> my<00:06:57.030> opponent<00:06:57.479> was<00:06:57.569> using<00:06:58.080> Ray<00:06:58.229> Lewis<00:06:58.590> to

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
but my opponent was using Ray Lewis to

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.379 
but my opponent was using Ray Lewis to
be<00:06:59.280> honest<00:06:59.639> it<00:06:59.789> probably<00:07:00.090> would<00:07:00.180> have<00:07:00.210> been<00:07:00.300> a

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
be honest it probably would have been a

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.740 
be honest it probably would have been a
touchdown<00:07:00.960> that<00:07:01.860> one's<00:07:02.099> on<00:07:02.310> me<00:07:02.550> guys<00:07:02.759> I<00:07:03.210> know<00:07:03.630> I
