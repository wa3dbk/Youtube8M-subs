00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.140
 to the boys of the girls as they are 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.690
 I hope you are super good I am super 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.269
 well also today I will do 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.400
 as the title already says a makeup 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.980
 for Christmas fair of suspicions that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.929
 are coming closer now or I can use it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.360
 for any occasion but to me 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.670
 It looks like it 's perfect for Christmas 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.940
 because it's like super bright and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 Frost and doraditos arrears 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.240
 brown and black ornament and it is also 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.039
 super natural to me in my opinion 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.870
 it seems that I do not have to be so 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.570
 makeup for christmas eve christmas 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.579
 that is because as it is in family and not 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.079
 is sweating and then I'm not going to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.120
 I need a lot of things to last me 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.980
 All night decide for this look 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.020
 I hope you like it fun and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.970
 try it 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.790
 let's use this higuain fact of 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.310
 maybelline to illuminate 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.250
 in fact it's like a little bit lighter 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.440
 that my skin can see it is a bit 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 clearer but it helps me because 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.720
 fact illuminates the dark part of the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 dark circles you never have to go for a shade 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.320
 too light but as one more tone 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320
 Clear 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.650
 for the eyes decide to use colors like 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:34.250
 golden brown and black this duo of 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.250
 max factor called paul voss 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.630
 and then 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.110
 in the part almost in all the eyelid 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.110
 eyelids 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.880
 and as you can see next I have a charge 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.979
 my brown I'm going to put it in the middle 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.979
 of the moving body for outside like this 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:14.110
 let's go to our naked some 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.110
 another degree that I already have with the east 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.790
 who is called baker 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.960
 I'm going to take a little bit and I'm going to put it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.960
 in my center 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.220
 to mark a little more the basin let's go 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.900
 to use this brown 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.799
 the pac 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.799
 of the mind 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.099
 dominant 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.099
 let's take once and it's annular 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:01.360
 and we are going to take the golden one that we took 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.650
 before and we're going to put it down 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.650
 very pegadito 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.819
 we are going to mix the two 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.379
 previous browns and we're going to 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.379
 blur by doubt 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.280
 and with the same brochita 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.430
 angular let's take this money that I 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.720
 love because it has like leaps and we 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.720
 let's outline above 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.409
 finally we light up this part 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.409
 Y 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.629
 we do the lashes and we put on 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.340
 many layers of mascara thing that I already 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.340
 I had already had mascara already had 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.120
 use the tabs but it has been in a 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.120
 full 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.410
 it's pretty bright and all because I think 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.410
 that for Christmas is like that 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.580
 enough lights and brightness and the little letters 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.040
 and all things 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.829
 then I thought that was the look 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.960
 suitable if you want you can but can 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.390
 be darker delineating you inside 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.700
 or if you want to have the biggest eyes 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.490
 you can delineate with white inside 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.580
 but that already depends on you that's a 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.760
 option that I give you and obviously I 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.180
 it would be necessary to seal it with powders 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.180
 corrector 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:03.479
 and then I'm going to use this lipstick 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.479
 white that is called what I saw 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.539
 and it's a pinkish hue that looks like it looks 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.930
 little strong but really when I tell you 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.250
 you put 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.250
 It's super nice 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.300
 for girls and this is all complete 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.430
 I put some bronzer only go 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.240
 of powders I paint my eyebrows a little and 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.009
 I put on my lipstick and I told you everything 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.830
 I think it's super nice 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.620
 because it's like the natural but also 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.139
 is very suitable for the occasion because it is 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.150
 like super bright illuminated of all 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.340
 those things if they try do not forget 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.759

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.449

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:56.180
