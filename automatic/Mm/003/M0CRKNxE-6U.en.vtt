00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.740
 3rd place in the top ten comic strip 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.130
 Chronization 2014, the first avenger 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.189
 another war by the way its original 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.990
 name captain america winter soldier 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.070
 Well, with translations we have, as always 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:39.500
 some surprises hello to you all 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.449
 quadriga and we start the fun 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.210
 what's the hype around this movie in 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.280
 the internet was full of everything praised him 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.440
 said that he swung into the territory 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.479
 political thrillers and then when 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.780
 drafting topon from the beginning yielded 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.250
 third place ninja turtles 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.680
 imagine how all the bombanulo and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.930
 so why is everyone praising this movie so much 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.059
 everyone just reasons 2 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.720
 firstly because the film is true 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.510
 I also have a decent cup and secondly, well 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.280
 This is the first normal film about the captain and 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.680
 America I can not decide 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.619
 how best to talk about the captain of america 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.270
 or about captain america okay I'll be better 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.759
 speak illegible so no one 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.770
 I understand the questions will be less and since 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.289
 many might notice i usually very 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.270
 toxic and tolerant to 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.579
 everything that exists in the world of comics 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.859
 industry but it does not mean that I am so 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.079
 sun paw it only means that to me 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.009
 painful to remember what actually 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.049
 hate 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.689
 and therefore usually try in any movie 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.700
 find something good but still in the beginning 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.249
 the activities of this channel i somehow 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.530
 spoke negatively about the first movie that 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:48.649
 caused many violently and discontent 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 and now six months later I repeat 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.600
 cappy 's first film is the weakest film 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.399
 marvel studios not say to that 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.229
 the most tactless i wording i 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.659
 came up with but for obscene reviews I 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.889
 somehow created the third channel and I will 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.840
 lead him in a mask 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.639
 I will make myself a cartoon character 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.679
 like fire good idea by the way 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:09.440
 so the first movie was just for someone 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.990
 funny tape zakosy under retro 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.959
 funny nonsense and kris evansom 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.300
 body of a 12 year old boy but for me he 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.370
 was actually a blow to the dead in which 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.530
 everything was done so badly and 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.150
 cheap as far as marvel still seems 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.599
 weeks 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.700
 or never and then the second movie universe 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.220
 marvel in its heyday and era 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.129
 epic franchise overwhelms the movie 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.079
 theatrical world and the film just didn't have 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.110
 right to screw it up well and as you understand 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.090
 not screwed up in the second film authors 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.680
 did everything to show that steve 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.720
 rogers have testicles 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.180
 he really has a place in the super 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.730
 the heroic world of marvel yes he still 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.159
 a little wooden and too rested 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.560
 positive but hey who cares 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.930
 now he mows down his enemies with piles 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.190
 sends ass guides and sucks off 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.200
 Scarlett Johansson 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.859
 although not entirely at will cup became 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.230
 the cap we were waiting for all this 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:13.239
 sounds like a macheto movie trailer 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:15.700
 but a devoted soldier who does not know defeat 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.510
 knows no compromise with its 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.599
 conscience 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.310
 all women are his man capable 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:29.889
 tub or kerry captain america 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.230
 so what waited well and of course it is clear 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.660
 that for American viewers it was 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.510
 generally unreal holiday because cap there 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.909
 actually a national hero character pro 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.800
 which is finally in almost 90 years 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:49.680
 life lifted normal what is there 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:52.350
 and moreover a good movie of course 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.060
 that after such a success 3 fortress 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.730
 again take the Russo brothers 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.710
 responsible for the winter soldier by the way 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.600
 they say they are a baptist in 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.580
 In the future, you will put your hand rather 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.860
 all too good sequel to 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.250
 studio boss cutting table will fall 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.750
 one of the most popular marvel stories 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.730
 civil war in original comic 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.530
 All Mulka was in the act of registration 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.530
 superheroes supposedly the savior of mankind 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.410
 it was proposed to remove the mask out then 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.600
 began the carcasses of the light in this case as 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.460
 in the case of a winter soldier at first 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.140
 the plan seems to be political 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.780
 component that is for a number of sources 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.660
 no precisely what the act of registration 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.820
 superheroes will not be more accurate but in 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.070
 a slightly different form is that 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.410
 so much will be so stiff strain the fact 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.960
 abundance of people beyond the control 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.810
 no laws and obviously he 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.480
 will lead some kind of movement in order to create 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.400
 for all this at least a kind of control 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.980
 plus as we all know in history could 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.580
 a dinner spider does not appear 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.080
 sony 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.940
 but now this is most likely not 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.310
 happen though as i was telling in 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.360
 another video god knows him get 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.300
 summit on the nose 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.460
 let us have a look further 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.200
 The first avenger is clearly visible 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.840
 demonstrated the fact that even 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.570
 a hero that the audience did not seem the most 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.150
 interesting can be shown effectively and 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.970
 make his participation an excellent movie and 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.100
 please fans of course there to tape 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.080
 claims as without them for example me 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.570
 absolutely not satisfied with the sudden 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.669
 appearance of a falcon costume and someone 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.740
 made laugh the doctor passed in the image of the new 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.260
 version of syria but that's all the details 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.330
 the movie was a good one at home 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.520
 so caused a huge resonance 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.290
 a ton of enthusiasm and seizures 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.470
 uncontrollable masturbation on 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.740
 stars and stripes flag although in principle 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.960
 it happened with them before and so 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.560
 third place in the list of the best comics 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.129
 screen versions for 2014 the first avenger 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.039
 another war 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.379
 at lunch first and second place so 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.809
 do not miss and you can put me 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.389
 Like to make me more positive and 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:00.459
 the release came out more cheerful and more interesting 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.889
