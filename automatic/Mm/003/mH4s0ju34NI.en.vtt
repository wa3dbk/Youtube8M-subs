alright so first let's just hop right
into<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> new<00:00:22.560> map<00:00:22.830> made<00:00:23.160> by<00:00:23.310> PF<00:00:23.699> LC<00:00:24.029> member

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
into the new map made by PF LC member

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.460 
into the new map made by PF LC member
who<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.340> riz<00:00:26.340> x<00:00:26.750> 333<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:27.930> i<00:00:27.990> pronounced<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
who is riz x 333 so i pronounced that

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.769 
who is riz x 333 so i pronounced that
wrong<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.279> chose<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> name<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.599> map

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
wrong but you chose the name so the map

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
wrong but you chose the name so the map
is<00:00:30.960> called<00:00:31.170> halo<00:00:31.380> 4<00:00:31.679> wraparound<00:00:32.009> version<00:00:32.520> for

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is called halo 4 wraparound version for

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.729 
is called halo 4 wraparound version for
now<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.780> wraparound<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.620> not

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
now we all know that wraparound is not

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.990 
now we all know that wraparound is not
even<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> name<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> map<00:00:35.430> anymore<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.969> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
even the name of the map anymore but you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.100 
even the name of the map anymore but you
know<00:00:36.180> why<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.360> may<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.840> little<00:00:36.960> outdated

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
know why this may be a little outdated

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.560 
know why this may be a little outdated
so<00:00:37.620> anyways<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.579> hop<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:38.790> into<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.360> map

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
so anyways just hop right into this map

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
so anyways just hop right into this map
is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:40.110> cool<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.860> remake<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
is a really cool a little remake of the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
is a really cool a little remake of the
map<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.120> remade<00:00:42.450> by<00:00:42.480> premake<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
map but not remade by premake so it's a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.740 
map but not remade by premake so it's a
little<00:00:44.430> interesting<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.420> about<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
little interesting what I like about is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.900 
little interesting what I like about is
that<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> bottom<00:00:46.320> part<00:00:46.680> matches<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> top

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that the bottom part matches the top

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
that the bottom part matches the top
part<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.390> works<00:00:48.539> out<00:00:48.719> perfectly<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> way

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
part and it works out perfectly the way

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
part and it works out perfectly the way
the<00:00:50.309> way<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.550> lined<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.030> those<00:00:51.149> blocks

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the way it's lined up with those blocks

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.160 
the way it's lined up with those blocks
also<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.440> symmetrical<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> very

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
also it's very symmetrical and very

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.150 
also it's very symmetrical and very
interesting<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.260> how<00:00:55.379> everything<00:00:55.860> smoothly

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
interesting on how everything smoothly

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.490 
interesting on how everything smoothly
works<00:00:56.520> together<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:57.480> played<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.899> me<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.260> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
works together we played for me for but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.420 
works together we played for me for but
I<00:00:58.530> don't<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:58.980> enough<00:00:59.190> maybe

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
I don't know if that was enough maybe

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.450 
I don't know if that was enough maybe
6v6<00:00:59.910> possibly<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.750> work<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> best<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
6v6 possibly would work the best but it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
6v6 possibly would work the best but it
was<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.699> fun<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:04.260> interesting<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
was very fun very very interesting to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
was very fun very very interesting to
play<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.640> reason<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.390> fun<00:01:06.450> was

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
play the reason it was so much fun was

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
play the reason it was so much fun was
because<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.530> time<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.130> was<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.280> top

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
because that one time when I was on top

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.510 
because that one time when I was on top
and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.810> saw<00:01:10.290> people<00:01:10.619> running<00:01:10.710> around<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.250> didn't

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and I saw people running around I didn't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
and I saw people running around I didn't
know<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> bottom<00:01:12.119> floor<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
know there was a bottom floor so the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.480 
know there was a bottom floor so the
main<00:01:13.500> reason<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:13.979> much<00:01:14.070> fun<00:01:14.130> because

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
main reason it was so much fun because

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.950 
main reason it was so much fun because
there's<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.790> much<00:01:14.880> more<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> building

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
there's so much more of the building

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440 
there's so much more of the building
more<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> structure<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> explore<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:18.330> I'm

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
more of the structure to explore now I'm

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
more of the structure to explore now I'm
not<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:19.049> halo<00:01:19.200> 4<00:01:19.500> stuff<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.950> yet

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
not really into halo 4 stuff just yet

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.910 
not really into halo 4 stuff just yet
more<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.759> halo<00:01:20.909> forge<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> I'm<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:22.770> really

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
more into halo forge so I'm don't really

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.050 
more into halo forge so I'm don't really
know<00:01:23.070> anything<00:01:23.280> about<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.729> new<00:01:23.850> maps

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
know anything about the new maps

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.910 
know anything about the new maps
anything<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
anything like that so not really do that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
anything like that so not really do that
but<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.430> didn't<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> really

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
but I didn't know that this is a really

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.240 
but I didn't know that this is a really
fun<00:01:28.140> mapped<00:01:28.320> plane<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> probably<00:01:28.979> recommend

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
fun mapped plane I probably recommend

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.109 
fun mapped plane I probably recommend
that<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.030> be

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
see that the Houthis the back part wraps

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.490 
see that the Houthis the back part wraps
around<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> entire<00:01:45.149> thing<00:01:45.390> gets<00:01:45.930> pinched<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
around the entire thing gets pinched the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.520 
around the entire thing gets pinched the
word<00:01:46.649> wrap<00:01:46.979> around<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.350> basically<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
word wrap around but basically the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.289 
word wrap around but basically the
entire<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.670> connected<00:01:51.030> together

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
entire thing is all connected together

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.350 
entire thing is all connected together
in<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.899> big<00:01:52.079> massive<00:01:52.380> circle<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.399> half<00:01:53.880> circle

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
and interesting and very nicely

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.250 
and interesting and very nicely
structured<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.180> well<00:02:07.360> laid<00:02:07.780> out<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
structured and well laid out the

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.930 
structured and well laid out the
spawning<00:02:08.530> was<00:02:08.920> no<00:02:09.130> issues<00:02:09.490> i<00:02:09.670> don't<00:02:09.790> think

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
spawning was no issues i don't think

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.130 
spawning was no issues i don't think
anything<00:02:10.119> happened<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.570> us<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.900> spawning

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
anything happened to us in the spawning

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.320 
anything happened to us in the spawning
but<00:02:11.860> i<00:02:12.040> did<00:02:12.220> fall<00:02:12.400> off<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.610> map<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.820> lot<00:02:13.150> like

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
but i did fall off the map a lot like

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.030 
but i did fall off the map a lot like
right<00:02:13.540> here<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.410> careful<00:02:14.710> we're<00:02:14.800> falling

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
right here so be careful we're falling

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.470 
right here so be careful we're falling
off<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> mat<00:02:15.340> because<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.880> whole<00:02:16.240> lot<00:02:16.390> of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
off the mat because it is a whole lot of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.780 
off the mat because it is a whole lot of
feet<00:02:16.660> up<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.930> above<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.010> ground<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.460> be

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
feet up of above the ground so be

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.040 
feet up of above the ground so be
careful<00:02:19.060> with<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.330 

so<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.170> mapper<00:02:26.320> made<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.710> week<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.160> called

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
so the mapper made this week is called

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.890 
so the mapper made this week is called
holy<00:02:27.700> demons<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.300> reason<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.870> is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
holy demons the reason that is is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.110 
holy demons the reason that is is
because<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.650> zombies<00:02:30.220> are<00:02:30.250> freaking<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.790> fire

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
because the zombies are freaking on fire

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.300 
because the zombies are freaking on fire
that's<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.290> really<00:02:32.560> cool<00:02:32.740> addition<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.220> we

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
that's a really cool addition that we

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.160 
that's a really cool addition that we
made<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.730> game<00:02:34.000> though<00:02:34.690> I'm<00:02:34.840> not<00:02:34.870> really

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
made to the game though I'm not really

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.080 
made to the game though I'm not really
exactly<00:02:35.470> sure<00:02:35.830> who<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.100> design<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.610> game<00:02:36.850> type

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
exactly sure who to design a game type

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.430 
exactly sure who to design a game type
but<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.450> was<00:02:37.630> brought<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.870> his<00:02:38.080> by<00:02:38.200> an<00:02:38.260> armed

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
but it was brought to his by an armed

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.620 
but it was brought to his by an armed
guy<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.830> civilian<00:02:39.340> who<00:02:39.910> put<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.510> map

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
guy and civilian who put the map

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.510 
guy and civilian who put the map
together<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.170> made<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.410> designed<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.400> make

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
together and made this designed to make

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.670 
together and made this designed to make
it<00:02:42.550> look<00:02:42.760> like<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.060> from<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.810> underworld<00:02:44.200> so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
it look like it's from the underworld so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.410 
it look like it's from the underworld so
this<00:02:45.400> map<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.790> lot<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.030> fun<00:02:46.150> when<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.390> play

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
this map is a lot of fun when you play

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.820 
this map is a lot of fun when you play
it<00:02:46.780> because<00:02:46.960> it<00:02:47.260> just<00:02:47.410> has<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.710> different

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
it because it just has a different

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.880 
it because it just has a different
feeling<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.580> you're<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
feeling that you're in like the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.260 
feeling that you're in like the
underworld<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.520> you're<00:02:51.670> being<00:02:51.820> attacked<00:02:51.880> by

underworld and you're being attacked by

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.630 
underworld and you're being attacked by
