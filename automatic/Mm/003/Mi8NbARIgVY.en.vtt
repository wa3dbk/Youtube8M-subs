00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
just showing where I'm trying I'm trying

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.940 
just showing where I'm trying I'm trying
to<00:02:19.140> keep<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:20.959> where<00:02:21.959> I'm<00:02:22.049> cutting<00:02:22.409> it<00:02:22.530> even

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
to keep the where I'm cutting it even

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.920 
to keep the where I'm cutting it even
with<00:02:23.219> one<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.969> other<00:02:23.999> guidelines<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:24.870> I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
with one of the other guidelines so I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.300 
with one of the other guidelines so I
think<00:02:25.109> I'm<00:02:25.230> marked<00:02:25.499> it<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.739> an<00:02:25.859> inch<00:02:26.069> away

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
think I'm marked it like an inch away

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.300 
think I'm marked it like an inch away
from<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.389> guideline<00:02:27.900> i<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:28.230> measured<00:02:28.409> from

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
from the guideline i just measured from

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.000 
from the guideline i just measured from
the<00:02:29.400> waistband<00:02:30.030> down<00:02:30.269> kind<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.319> how<00:02:31.620> long<00:02:31.889> i

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the waistband down kind of to how long i

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.280 
the waistband down kind of to how long i
wanted<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.609> from<00:02:33.420> my<00:02:33.569> waist<00:02:33.780> down<00:02:34.019> to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
wanted it to be from my waist down to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.229 
wanted it to be from my waist down to
about<00:02:34.859> like<00:02:35.400> right<00:02:35.579> above<00:02:35.730> my<00:02:35.879> knee<00:02:35.939> or

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
about like right above my knee or

about like right above my knee or
something<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.849> next<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.180> pictures<00:02:39.389> there

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
something and the next to pictures there

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.440 
something and the next to pictures there
I've<00:02:40.049> just<00:02:40.109> kind<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.799> marked<00:02:41.159> in<00:02:41.340> place<00:02:42.120> are

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
I've just kind of marked in place are

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.530 
I've just kind of marked in place are
just<00:02:43.290> an<00:02:43.379> inch<00:02:43.530> above<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:45.000> taking<00:02:45.389> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
just an inch above just taking and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.300 
just an inch above just taking and
actually<00:02:45.599> marking<00:02:46.079> on<00:02:46.169> the<00:02:46.230> pattern<00:02:46.439> you'll

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
actually marking on the pattern you'll

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.699 
actually marking on the pattern you'll
find<00:02:47.519> with<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:48.719> multi<00:02:49.109> size<00:02:49.290> patterns

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
find with with multi size patterns

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.039 
find with with multi size patterns
that's<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.219> handy<00:02:50.370> if<00:02:50.609> you've<00:02:50.730> got<00:02:50.969> one<00:02:51.930> of

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
that's really handy if you've got one of

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.050 
that's really handy if you've got one of
these<00:02:52.109> markers<00:02:52.530> mind<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.099> used<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.579> double

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
these markers mind that I used is double

these markers mind that I used is double
ended<00:02:54.299> its<00:02:54.450> disappearing<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.319> one<00:02:55.469> end<00:02:55.650> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
light blue on the other you can just

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.319 
light blue on the other you can just
mark<00:03:01.739> directly<00:03:02.099> on<00:03:02.189> the<00:03:02.250> pattern<00:03:02.609> if<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:03.209> do

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
mark directly on the pattern if you do

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.179 
mark directly on the pattern if you do
all<00:03:03.449> your<00:03:03.540> measuring<00:03:03.900> before<00:03:04.469> you<00:03:04.980> actually

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
all your measuring before you actually

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.479 
all your measuring before you actually
cut<00:03:05.609> your<00:03:05.760> pieces<00:03:05.969> then<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.349> can<00:03:07.500> follow<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
cut your pieces then you can follow the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.009 
cut your pieces then you can follow the
guidelines<00:03:08.669> on<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.209> pattern<00:03:09.389> I<00:03:09.629> don't<00:03:09.840> always

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
guidelines on the pattern I don't always

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.689 
guidelines on the pattern I don't always
go<00:03:10.169> by<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.379> measurements<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> back<00:03:11.549> of

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:11.699 
go by the measurements in the back of

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:12.949 
go by the measurements in the back of
the<00:03:11.760> pattern<00:03:12.060> those<00:03:12.269> can<00:03:12.449> be<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.540> little<00:03:12.659> screwy

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
the pattern those can be a little screwy

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.830 
the pattern those can be a little screwy
because<00:03:13.290> they<00:03:13.409> do<00:03:13.469> add<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.639> ease<00:03:14.969> on<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.269> few

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
because they do add in ease on a few

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.990 
because they do add in ease on a few
places<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:16.980> look<00:03:17.219> at<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.760> finished

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
places but if you look at the finished

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.459 
places but if you look at the finished
measurements<00:03:18.299> usually<00:03:18.840> that's<00:03:19.019> actually

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:19.469 
measurements usually that's actually

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.140 
measurements usually that's actually
printed<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.889> pattern<00:03:20.189> piece<00:03:20.370> usually<00:03:20.879> add

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
printed on the pattern piece usually add

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.089 
printed on the pattern piece usually add
like<00:03:21.479> bus<00:03:21.840> point<00:03:22.139> waist<00:03:22.379> point<00:03:22.650> hit<00:03:22.829> point

like bus point waist point hit point

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.189 
like bus point waist point hit point
you'll<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> circle<00:03:24.659> that's<00:03:24.870> quarter

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
you'll see a circle that's quarter

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.670 
you'll see a circle that's quarter
across<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.549> marks<00:03:27.349> what<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.530> finished

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
across and that marks what the finished

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.679 
across and that marks what the finished
measurements<00:03:28.979> are<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.609> be<00:03:29.759> off<00:03:30.000> at

measurements are going to be off at
those<00:03:30.900> points<00:03:31.229> so<00:03:32.060> give<00:03:33.060> yourself<00:03:33.419> anywhere

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
those points so give yourself anywhere

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.249

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
hem to try to slim the skirt out a

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.629 
hem to try to slim the skirt out a
little<00:05:30.539> bit<00:05:30.719> you've<00:05:31.589> probably<00:05:31.889> seen<00:05:32.369> that

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
little bit you've probably seen that

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.689 
little bit you've probably seen that
picture<00:05:32.849> where<00:05:33.389> there's<00:05:33.930> some<00:05:34.199> threads<00:05:34.699> loose

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
picture where there's some threads loose

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.029 
picture where there's some threads loose
where<00:05:36.089> I<00:05:36.119> had<00:05:36.419> to<00:05:36.689> rip<00:05:36.899> out<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.439> ruffles<00:05:38.009> I

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
where I had to rip out the ruffles I

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.639 
where I had to rip out the ruffles I
take<00:05:38.249> them<00:05:38.369> all<00:05:38.430> back<00:05:38.579> off<00:05:39.019> and<00:05:40.019> of<00:05:40.619> course

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:40.649 
take them all back off and of course

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:41.989 
take them all back off and of course
then<00:05:40.979> use<00:05:41.159> the<00:05:41.309> second<00:05:41.639> third<00:05:41.759> and<00:05:41.879> fourth

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:41.999 
then use the second third and fourth

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:46.819 
then use the second third and fourth
rofls<00:05:42.419> instead<00:05:42.749> of<00:05:42.839> the<00:05:42.930> first<00:05:43.169> one<00:05:44.119> so<00:05:45.119> on<00:05:46.110> the

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:46.829 
rofls instead of the first one so on the

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:48.889 
rofls instead of the first one so on the
next<00:05:47.129> picture<00:05:47.309> there<00:05:47.639> is<00:05:47.939> where<00:05:48.449> I've

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:48.899 
next picture there is where I've

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:51.469 
next picture there is where I've
actually<00:05:49.379> stitched<00:05:49.979> some<00:05:50.579> stay<00:05:50.819> stitching<00:05:51.269> at

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
actually stitched some stay stitching at

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.679 
actually stitched some stay stitching at
the<00:05:52.399> stitching<00:05:53.399> line<00:05:53.729> on<00:05:54.029> the<00:05:54.119> ruffles<00:05:54.479> and

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
the stitching line on the ruffles and

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:56.689 
the stitching line on the ruffles and
then<00:05:54.990> decided<00:05:55.619> to<00:05:55.649> clip<00:05:55.919> it<00:05:56.039> and<00:05:56.159> fold<00:05:56.369> it<00:05:56.490> back

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
then decided to clip it and fold it back

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.769 
then decided to clip it and fold it back
with<00:05:56.879> an<00:05:56.969> iron<00:05:57.149> as<00:05:57.740> opposed<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:59.129> arm<00:05:59.779> putting

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:00.779 
with an iron as opposed to arm putting

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.419 
with an iron as opposed to arm putting
right<00:06:01.139> sides<00:06:01.409> together<00:06:01.529> and<00:06:01.829> stitching<00:06:02.309> it

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:02.429 
right sides together and stitching it

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.919 
right sides together and stitching it
and<00:06:02.519> then<00:06:02.610> folding<00:06:02.939> it<00:06:03.029> down<00:06:03.179> ironing<00:06:03.599> it<00:06:03.689> flat

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:03.929 
and then folding it down ironing it flat

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:05.299 
and then folding it down ironing it flat
and<00:06:03.959> then<00:06:04.229> stitching<00:06:04.469> it<00:06:04.679> again<00:06:04.860> on<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.099> top

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:05.309 
and then stitching it again on the top

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.269 
and then stitching it again on the top
side<00:06:05.629> that<00:06:06.629> was<00:06:07.019> a<00:06:07.050> lot<00:06:07.229> of<00:06:07.259> work<00:06:07.469> and<00:06:07.709> it's

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
side that was a lot of work and it's

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.799 
side that was a lot of work and it's
hard<00:06:08.550> to<00:06:08.610> actually<00:06:08.789> see<00:06:09.449> where<00:06:09.629> you're

00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:09.809 
hard to actually see where you're

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.019 
hard to actually see where you're
placing<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.589> ruffle<00:06:10.889> you<00:06:11.039> have<00:06:11.189> to<00:06:11.339> just<00:06:11.490> have

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
placing the ruffle you have to just have

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.869 
placing the ruffle you have to just have
marked<00:06:12.839> it<00:06:12.899> really<00:06:13.110> well<00:06:13.229> so<00:06:14.099> what<00:06:14.729> I<00:06:14.759> did

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:14.879 
marked it really well so what I did

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.969 
marked it really well so what I did
instead<00:06:15.119> was<00:06:15.569> just<00:06:15.929> on<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.379> second<00:06:16.889> time

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
instead was just on the second time

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.889 
instead was just on the second time
around<00:06:17.039> with<00:06:17.369> the<00:06:17.459> ruffles<00:06:17.789> was<00:06:18.059> just<00:06:18.389> folded

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:18.899 
around with the ruffles was just folded

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:22.159 
around with the ruffles was just folded
down<00:06:19.669> iron<00:06:20.669> it<00:06:20.819> flat<00:06:21.059> so<00:06:21.389> that<00:06:21.539> i<00:06:21.569> could<00:06:21.689> put

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
down iron it flat so that i could put

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.259 
down iron it flat so that i could put
wrong<00:06:22.919> side<00:06:23.159> to<00:06:23.279> right<00:06:23.399> side<00:06:23.459> and<00:06:23.789> actually

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:24.269 
wrong side to right side and actually

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:26.569 
wrong side to right side and actually
lay<00:06:25.169> it<00:06:25.289> out<00:06:25.379> the<00:06:25.589> way<00:06:25.769> you<00:06:26.159> would<00:06:26.309> actually

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:26.579 
lay it out the way you would actually

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:29.989 
lay it out the way you would actually
see<00:06:26.789> it<00:06:27.559> when<00:06:28.559> I<00:06:28.589> was<00:06:28.740> pinning<00:06:28.949> it<00:06:29.159> so<00:06:29.399> it<00:06:29.519> was<00:06:29.969> a

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:29.999 
see it when I was pinning it so it was a

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.029 
see it when I was pinning it so it was a
lot<00:06:30.179> easier<00:06:30.240> to<00:06:30.629> control<00:06:30.809> exactly<00:06:31.379> where<00:06:32.009> I

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
lot easier to control exactly where I

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.119 
lot easier to control exactly where I
was<00:06:32.339> pinning<00:06:32.610> it<00:06:32.789> I<00:06:32.969> also<00:06:33.389> used<00:06:33.779> um<00:06:34.079> not<00:06:34.860> shown

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
was pinning it I also used um not shown

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.189 
was pinning it I also used um not shown
here<00:06:35.369> but<00:06:35.519> i<00:06:35.550> also<00:06:35.699> used<00:06:35.849> a<00:06:35.939> measuring<00:06:36.360> tape<00:06:36.539> to

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
here but i also used a measuring tape to

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.659 
here but i also used a measuring tape to
measure<00:06:37.319> from<00:06:37.589> the<00:06:37.649> top<00:06:37.889> of<00:06:37.949> the<00:06:38.219> skirt<00:06:38.399> down

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
measure from the top of the skirt down

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.579 
measure from the top of the skirt down
to<00:06:39.029> where<00:06:39.300> i<00:06:39.329> was<00:06:39.689> actually<00:06:39.870> pinning<00:06:40.439> the

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:40.589 
to where i was actually pinning the

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:43.219 
to where i was actually pinning the
lowest<00:06:40.919> ruffle<00:06:41.459> and<00:06:41.639> keep<00:06:42.419> that<00:06:42.599> uniform<00:06:43.050> all

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
lowest ruffle and keep that uniform all

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:43.439 
lowest ruffle and keep that uniform all
the

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
the

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.480 
the
skirt<00:06:44.229> I<00:06:44.409> did<00:06:44.590> that<00:06:44.710> again<00:06:44.949> with<00:06:45.069> a<00:06:45.099> second

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
skirt I did that again with a second

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.820 
skirt I did that again with a second
rough<00:06:45.610> one<00:06:45.759> of<00:06:45.849> course<00:06:46.090> the<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:46.870> first<00:06:47.499> ruffle

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
rough one of course the the first ruffle

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.820 
rough one of course the the first ruffle
at<00:06:47.919> the<00:06:47.979> top<00:06:48.189> um<00:06:48.460> just<00:06:49.270> aligns<00:06:49.779> with<00:06:50.080> the<00:06:50.139> the

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
at the top um just aligns with the the

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.799 
at the top um just aligns with the the
same<00:06:51.039> edge<00:06:51.249> so<00:06:52.289> last<00:06:53.289> two<00:06:53.469> pictures<00:06:53.680> there<00:06:54.069> are

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:54.809 
same edge so last two pictures there are

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.570 
same edge so last two pictures there are
obviously<00:06:55.809> post-production<00:06:56.680> on<00:06:57.009> the<00:06:57.069> dress<00:06:57.279> I

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
obviously post-production on the dress I

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.640 
obviously post-production on the dress I
think<00:06:58.360> I<00:06:58.449> may<00:06:58.689> be<00:06:58.719> still<00:06:59.020> a<00:06:59.050> little<00:06:59.110> hemming<00:06:59.529> to

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
think I may be still a little hemming to

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.839 
think I may be still a little hemming to
do<00:06:59.770> but<00:06:59.949> you<00:07:00.039> can<00:07:00.099> reach<00:07:00.370> out<00:07:00.490> and<00:07:00.960> then<00:07:02.069> me<00:07:03.069> in

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
do but you can reach out and then me in

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:08.189 
do but you can reach out and then me in
the<00:07:03.939> rest<00:07:04.120> so<00:07:04.889> that's<00:07:05.889> it<00:07:06.189> and<00:07:06.550> I<00:07:07.360> felt<00:07:07.960> like<00:07:08.050> it

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
the rest so that's it and I felt like it

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.959 
the rest so that's it and I felt like it
went<00:07:08.379> pretty<00:07:08.710> easily<00:07:08.979> i<00:07:09.249> probably<00:07:09.639> would<00:07:09.879> have

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
went pretty easily i probably would have

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:12.779 
went pretty easily i probably would have
it<00:07:10.210> took<00:07:10.419> me<00:07:10.599> i<00:07:10.949> think<00:07:11.949> i<00:07:12.009> started<00:07:12.400> on<00:07:12.520> on

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
it took me i think i started on on

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.029 
it took me i think i started on on

pattern<00:07:36.189> to<00:07:36.339> do<00:07:36.460> and<00:07:36.759> it<00:07:37.029> wasn't<00:07:37.270> hard<00:07:37.389> to

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:37.509 
pattern to do and it wasn't hard to

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:40.610 
pattern to do and it wasn't hard to
combine<00:07:38.169> the<00:07:38.199> two<00:07:38.580> the<00:07:39.580> two<00:07:39.610> patterns<00:07:39.939> so
