00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.900
 hello girls so I two loquillo this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
 the second chapter of riding my pc I 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.890
 has brought me pc components 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.599
 the truth that was to make the payment and the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 next did not have at home for a hundred 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.080
 for sure and do at your time and a lot 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.970
 also said that it is a hard drive but 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 I 'm telling you no because it's a plate 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.689
 clear base that yes I have chosen a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 gigabyte because for me it is one of the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 brands that I like and those that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.780
 best moose boards worth is the z model 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.129
 77 x 4 th 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.769
 is internal is processed and good 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.059
 Well, bring a goodbye that is in 3d not in 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.699
 I change the configuration a bit 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.649
 is that a typical that old because 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.480
 change them we have the accessories that 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.449
 he brings that would be to connect in his like 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.070
 that are two nvidia graphics cards the 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.469
 embellisher that would be connected to the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.600
 box that there then there would enter all 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.390
 the outputs that after the plate to make 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 all connections are valid and here as 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.869
 You can see also ours a 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.430
 packet with two cables and another 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.229
 packet with two others to connect 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.390
 all sata ports and everything to 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 valuable computer hard drives 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.780
 etc here this is something very important that 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.940
 the people when you take the strips 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.170
 instructions so that here is very 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.130
 important to read it about all the people 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.600
 that she is used to doing 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.490
 computers to know how many 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.520
 connections and there you can see the disk of 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.520
 drivers motherboard brings such as 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.659
 all we would miss more and here the manual 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.509
 of user that is also recommended 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.830
 that exists, always keep an eye on everyone 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.600
 papers that they extract because although it is 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.330
 by some they put for wanting to cut 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.860
 Trees put them because it 's interesting 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.140
 here you see the projections that the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.240
 plate to and from the sound that to this 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.710
 optical is the pitcher shirt of 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.170
 our plate that are thunderball that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.510
 I'll talk about this at the end of the video here 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.950
 the two USB 3.0 ports will connect the 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.000
 mouse and keyboard as recommended 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.520
 do what you want but I what 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.050
 I recommend this socket where it would go 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.580
 the processor that is an 11 55 from intel 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.920
 that I will not reveal what will be here 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.550
 we see four slots to fit our 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.190
 ram that supports up to 32 gb of 1600 but 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.770
 also supports 12 of 2,800 in the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.440
 RAM memory is worth it since it is a part 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.330
 very important of this motherboard the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.120
 32 gig support 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.910
 here we see the 3 pci-express has the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.400
 up would be the pci express 3.0 which is 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.620
 what we are giving the new graphs 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.910
 more more pc connections and to connect 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.300
 for good there we can connect so much 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.430
 capturing as usb outputs 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.220
 sound cards etc etc would not be 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.590
 connections that never only on a plate 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.910
 that's the stack, it's worth all the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.070
 motherboards that normally 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.260
 would go all the connections of the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:55.380
 box plugged into the board 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.840
 leds reading the disk reading 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.160
 hard etc buenos aires- connected almost 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.200
 all the cables that after the box by 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.210
 say all absolutely everyone go there 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.740
 here you are seeing the plate not for 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.140
 you do not see a little bit more from the center of 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.400
 fish because with each other 3.0 a lot since 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.680
 my graphic the gtx in 170 supports spc and 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.090
 I would like to try it but I took and good 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.590
 I decided that this plate then what 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.240
 I'm seeing in the image that many do not 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.120
 you will know what is and is the technology 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.260
 thunderbolt that's a dual thunderbolt and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.260
 good to give you an idea 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.690
 every pinch of those is capable of 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.350
 transfer 10 gigas of virile data 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.850
 functionally that means that I can 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.080
 transfer a full HD 1080p movie 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.320
 in less than 30 seconds to my pc 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.740
 this is something that is going to give you a lot 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.990
 talk will replace the usb 3.0 that 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.780
 they are currently transferring in 5 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.750
 gigas is to be in 10 and no longer say 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.780
 than the 2.0 SDs that carry 480 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.700
 vegas here we could connect in each 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.680
 one of them we could connect six 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.540
 hard drives and one screen on the other 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.150
 another six hard drives and another screen 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.430
 since we're talking about connecting six 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.720
 hard drives to a single connection and a 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.820
 screen 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.489
 and well I decided on this plate 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.200
 basically for that piece of connections 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.390
 that brings that they are going to be the substitute 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.010
 very safe test of the judges of 3.0 more 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.470
 that nothing because they can be used to 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.710
 connect screens connect hard disk 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.150
 and everything goes and well guys I hope that 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.350
 You have liked to leave your opinion of 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.420
 the comment box and especially 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.980
 think about this technology the fran 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.680
 erbol I will leave you in the description 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.350
 a couple of pages for you to visit 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.000
 where they explain this technology and so 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.950
 you know better because I try 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.150
 explain it my way but maybe not 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.370
 I can explain enough 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.950
 alright so you already know down on the 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.300
 description spend see it and enjoy 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.980
 this magnificent technology and this 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.200
 magnificent motherboard that a theme of 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.090
 price-quality I have not seen 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.470
 things better so I decided guys I hope 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.390
 that you liked to give to favorites and 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.390
 See you soon trujillo chocha
