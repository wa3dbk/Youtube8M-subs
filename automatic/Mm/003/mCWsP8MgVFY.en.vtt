00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.600
 favorites as I mentioned before 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.930
 I really like to come here a lot 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.230
 because it is a place of 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.660
 have calm compared to shibuya this 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.550
 it's nothing the people who come here the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.800
 weekends it's the people who live 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.920
 here and around this place I was 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.390
 around here and there are cafes there 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.820
 restaurants 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.580
 where you can come and sit here in the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.770
 there are benches around here in this area 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.690
 nothing more to listen to music to put you 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.570
 read a book not just watch it go by 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:53.260
 the people there are boutiques so if you 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:55.300
 like fashion in this video I will 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.750
 show them some of the streets of this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.120
 area and apart in this video I'm going to talk 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.579
 of tattoos in japan as they are seen in 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.380
 Japanese society some people in 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.200
 Previous videos asked me about 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.000
 of tattoos in japan as they are seen in 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.180
 society so in this video I'm going to 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.040
 talk a little more about that in the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.869
 video job interviews in japan 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.869
 What I did a few days ago commented that 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.340
 when they interview you at work for 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.979
 a job they ask you if you have 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.970
 tattoos and I know some people 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.000
 foreign also what 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.140
 and they are working here in japan and 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.210
 what they have to do is 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.610
 cover your tattoos when going to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.830
 work one of my friends has a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.800
 tattoo behind the ear and she has to 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.140
 cover your tattoo with your hair and 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.690
 I know another person who has a tattoo 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.690
 in the neck and he has to be shirts 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.850
 neck a little higher than the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.550
 scope to cover the statute 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.410
 good not very long neck but they have 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.100
 than being shirts that reach to cover the 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.170
 statut tattoos in japan 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.520
 if they are related to the mafia he accuses them 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.890
 but it seems that lately the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.290
 perspective of the tattoos has changed 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.229
 and people have started to see it more as 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.240
 fashion a fashion I asked a 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.250
 co-worker on the subject he is 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.160
 Japanese and he told me that if a person 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.990
 Japanese tim a tattoo if it is possible that 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.540
 he is linked to the mafia but if he is a 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.300
 foreigner with a tattoo is not 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.160
 links the tattoo to the mafia 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.880
 foreigner in japan is considered as 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.430
 a fashion 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.340
 they do not see it in a negative way by another 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.230
 side if it is a Japanese with a tattoo is 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.680
 possible that Japanese society or some 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.660
 July with something negative so those 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.240
 have tattoos and are thinking 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.350
 coming to Japan do not worry you 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.480
 they can walk on the street freely 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.300
 showing his tattoos on people not 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.610
 he will see them in a bad way and there 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.430
 certain places where it is possible for them to 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.140
 ask that they be covered and if not 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.990
 they say nothing they will see signs that say 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.750
 please cover your tattoos before 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.380
 entering these places are like bathrooms 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.390
 public onzen ryokan drilling in 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.390
 the good body the same way if the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.850
 you have they are going to ask you all that you 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.500
 remove the accessories at work but 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.770
 they can walk on the street with their 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.090
 accessories although now that I mention it 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.180
 I have not seen many people with 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.430
 perforations in tokyo but I think it has 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.010
 to depend on the district where you go 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.410
 but the truth is if I think about it 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.240
 well since in the nine months that I've been 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.070
 here I have not seen people with 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.180
 perforations here then maybe to the best 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.579
 do not 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.230
 a lot of attention I have not considered 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.670
 shoot you but if someday I would like 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.980
 have one I would do it here in japan 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.989
 They have very good designs and very good 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.069
 artists that make them apart from me 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.560
 Like very much 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.680
 the Japanese designs here in japan the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.989
 Japanese bookstores I've seen magazines and 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.819
 books dedicated to tattoos and some of 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.680
 the times that I have gone to the bookstores I 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.719
 I have leafed through these magazines and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.280
 books and many of the designs that 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:04.620
 they have are beautiful I have heard that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.930
 there are conventions where artists that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.319
 they make tattoos all over japan and others 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.120
 countries do like an expo and show 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.939
 their jobs and they take it with 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.699
 seriousness for them is an art this 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.410
