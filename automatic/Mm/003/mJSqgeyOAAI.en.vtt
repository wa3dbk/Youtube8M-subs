00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.120
 first I want to thank you for the fact 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.780
 that have come to this conference of 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.950
 press that was quoted for you 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.410
 I want to start with touching a very 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.110
 important to us 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.020
 and it is a means of communication 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.220
 has managed that the team that changes 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.669
 headquarters 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.489
 thing that is totally false the team 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.410
 is still maintained in Culiacan 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.220
 team we do not plan on changing 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.019
 headquarters the team is from sinaloa and to 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.730
 all sinaloa 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.420
 we believe strongly believe in this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.940
 project have been done very good things 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.199
 people turned to delude with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.199
 team again people 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.890
 it caught on with the team they were rescued 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.110
 very specific things in the tournament 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.420
 so if I want to clarify that I want 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.820
 clarify that the team does not do not know where 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.590
 that rumor came out but it is totally false 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.860
 the team is still in juliaca we are not 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.430
 very happy to be here if there is a 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.350
 place that has the ones that have the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.150
 conditions to support a team of 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.490
 first division is culiacÃ¡n I do not see a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.410
 better place for a project that is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.690
 think about the future and what you want to do 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.690
 first division more than this city and 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.790
 This status 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.530
 on the other hand I also want 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.100
 I want to talk a little bit about what it was 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.270
 the tournament is true that it was a tournament 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.530
 suffered until the last instances 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.380
 I believe that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.750
 and the hobby the sponsors all 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.080
 those of us who are in this project 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.200
 players technical management body 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.270
 and media should be 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.740
 still much more at hand so that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 this is carried out so that this is carried 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.150
 out and can be achieved and we gave ourselves 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.530
 account or I think that on our part already 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.920
 they realized that 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.289
 we work in a very transparent way 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.390
 that we have no commitments with anyone that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.330
 We firmly believe in this project to 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.650
 ascend the team and if we continue 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
 working in the way that 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.330
 we are doing and improving some 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.390
 things we are going to achieve do not have any doubt 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.660
 what are we going to achieve 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.240
 now comes the final process of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.069
 evaluation of seeing that boys 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.400
 they continue because there are many many 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.790
 players that are not ours there are many 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.040
 players that do not belong to us and that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.189
 we will have to do a very cold analysis 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.480
 to rearm the campus and to point him 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.960
 to better things the reality today is of 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.260
 what 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.940
 unfortunately we have to wait for another 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.860
 year to have consolidated the dream of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.860
 see golds in first division ' 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.630
 but surely and I have no doubt 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.150
 than working as we are doing 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.730
 and improving some cases some things 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.940
 we will also achieve it I do not have 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.590
 no doubt if I want through to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.830
 through this conference through 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.050
 the media and invite the fans to the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.840
 Media sponsors 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.030
 all that we worshiped him that 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.950
 do not lose faith it is true that we are 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.870
 very beaten and that the team along 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.760
 of his story has been hit by 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.640
 situations that we all know 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.230
 but nobody is going to take away that dream of 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.879
 return to the first division and what 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.269
 we are going to do deservedly and in the 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.269
 court 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.069
 I know that the fans are hurt like 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.069
 are we all of us has been 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.230
 a hobby that has suffered a lot but 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.599
 Ours also has to come 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.980
 you have to join ours and I'm sure 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.840
 that we're going to see that gold that everyone 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.840
 we want and I do not say it of 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.150
 to say it costs me how we are 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.100
 working and I know that if we move the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.470
 things in a better way and we improve in 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.940
 many areas and in many things we 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.350
 we have made a mistake, I also have to 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.510
 recognize recognize that 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.580
 but we have never done it in bad faith 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.220
 we have always seen by the institution 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.290
 today our president can not be 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.040
 here with us because he has a board 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.110
 in the Mexican operation 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.970
 as a club we are also going to show a 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.320
 disagreement about what happened because of what 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.060
 everyone knows and we have to have 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.350
 raise your voice we have to raise the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.210
 voice despite everything that has happened 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.100
 we continue to believe in the honesty of 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.200
 Mexican crude in the honesty of 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.300
 arbitration because for us it will be very 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.730
 easy to rant against everyone and 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.820
 this is not the case, we are a very serious directive 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.710
 and we believe firmly in honesty 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.210
 of Mexican soccer in the honesty of 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.000
 arbitration in the honesty of 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.050
 contraries in the honesty of all sudo 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.050
 Mexican in general 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.530
 happening other things I also want 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.390
 make them see what I was saying 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.000
 some time that they have done they have 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.530
 made changes we have made changes not 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.270
 only in the first team do you 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.830
 have seen in the basic forces that 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.470
 has worked and a project has been done and 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.810
 it has worked in a different way 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.190
 where now we have put a lot of emphasis 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.320
 in childhood and youth of sinaloa 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.249
 I think we go step by step it 's true that 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.829
 maybe we do not have 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:33.169
 our infrastructure of a club 

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:35.539
 first division but I think we're going very 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.489
 well let's take solid steps steps 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.699
 firm to get to what all 

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:39.699
 we want
