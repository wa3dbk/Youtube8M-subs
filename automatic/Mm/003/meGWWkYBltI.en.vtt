00:02:20.510 --> 00:03:06.110 
and then sixth string open E so
you

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:20.000 

it's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:41.640 

you<00:03:21.010> closed

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:50.500 

you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:11.190 

Oh

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.080 

technically<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.650> recording<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.549> find<00:04:14.000> it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
technically in the recording I find it

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.090 
technically in the recording I find it
easier<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:17.120> play<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:18.139> off<00:04:18.410> four<00:04:18.829> notes

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
easier to play the off four notes

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:28.549 
easier to play the off four notes
technically<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.910> recording<00:04:20.389> is<00:04:20.540> rest

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:28.559

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:30.899 
when I'm singing along with playing I

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.479 
when I'm singing along with playing I
find<00:04:31.139> it<00:04:31.259> easier<00:04:31.529> just<00:04:31.619> to<00:04:31.919> play<00:04:32.159> the<00:04:32.309> bass

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:32.489 
find it easier just to play the bass

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:36.799 
find it easier just to play the bass
another<00:04:32.849> plus<00:04:33.289> you<00:04:34.289> can<00:04:34.469> play<00:04:34.739> it<00:04:35.329> by<00:04:36.329> yourself

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:36.809 
another plus you can play it by yourself
