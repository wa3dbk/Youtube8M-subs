july to her beginning of august to
december<00:01:16.870> four<00:01:17.470> months<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:18.040> my<00:01:18.160> hair's<00:01:18.370> grown

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
three inches in four months is that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.680 
three inches in four months is that
possible<00:01:23.490> not<00:01:24.490> really<00:01:24.910> so<00:01:25.210> it's<00:01:25.360> probably<00:01:25.540> not

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
possible not really so it's probably not

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.150 
possible not really so it's probably not
three<00:01:26.050> inches<00:01:26.080> it's<00:01:26.470> probably<00:01:26.740> like<00:01:26.920> two

I don't really know what she used to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.640 
I don't really know what she used to
shampoo<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.750> lathered<00:02:57.230> up<00:02:57.349> so<00:02:57.560> I'm

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
shampoo it but it lathered up so I'm

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.679 
shampoo it but it lathered up so I'm
sure<00:02:58.069> had<00:02:58.579> sulfate<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.269> I<00:02:59.299> haven't<00:02:59.450> used

and did whatever you do with the
pressing<00:04:28.490> comb<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:28.910> then<00:04:29.690> Oh<00:04:30.050> before<00:04:30.260> she<00:04:30.530> did

that she put on satin press on my hair
which<00:04:35.000> i<00:04:35.120> think<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.449> what's<00:04:35.660> making<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.229> a

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
which i think is what's making it so a

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.899 
which i think is what's making it so a
little<00:04:36.680> funny<00:04:36.919> um<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.320> need<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.919> look<00:04:40.520> that

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
little funny um but I need to look that

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.689 
little funny um but I need to look that
product<00:04:41.599> up<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.139> see<00:04:42.380> like<00:04:42.620> if<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:43.220> has<00:04:43.370> bad

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
product up and see like if it has bad

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.110 
product up and see like if it has bad
things<00:04:44.289> hopefully<00:04:45.289> not<00:04:45.880> but<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.000> actually

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
things hopefully not but you actually

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.990 
things hopefully not but you actually
put<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.479> on<00:04:47.599> my<00:04:47.900> edges<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.979> on<00:04:49.099> my<00:04:49.280> scalp<00:04:49.639> and
