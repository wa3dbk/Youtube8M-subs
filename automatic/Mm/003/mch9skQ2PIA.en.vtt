modified driveshaft worked out perfectly
I<00:00:06.569> had<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.379> modify<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.859> transmission<00:00:08.580> cooler

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
I had to modify the transmission cooler

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.280 
I had to modify the transmission cooler
lines<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:10.160> make<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> 3-inch<00:00:11.730> mount<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:13.080> raise

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
lines and make a 3-inch mount to raise

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.700 
lines and make a 3-inch mount to raise
up<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.420> transmission<00:00:15.420> support<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.590> it

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
up the transmission support so that it

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.010 
up the transmission support so that it
transmission<00:00:17.340> sat<00:00:17.580> level<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> body<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
transmission sat level with the body of

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.580 
transmission sat level with the body of
the<00:00:19.080> truck<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.279> easy<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:21.590> so
