00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
next deal we got nilton again he is an

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.719

absolute class player to trade with and
um<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.590> think<00:01:55.590> there<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.790> weird

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
um I think there it's really weird

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
um I think there it's really weird
because<00:01:57.030> sometimes<00:01:57.540> there's<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.899> 20<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
because sometimes there's like 20 on the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
because sometimes there's like 20 on the
market<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.189> other<00:01:59.399> times<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
market and the other times is like I

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.999 
market and the other times is like I
think<00:02:00.960> three<00:02:01.259> or<00:02:01.290> four<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:01.920> weird

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
think three or four it's really weird

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
think three or four it's really weird
but<00:02:02.219> luckily<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:03.030> time<00:02:03.090> around<00:02:03.450> there's

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
but luckily this time around there's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.090 
but luckily this time around there's
about<00:02:03.869> five<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> market<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:04.860> were<00:02:04.920> going

have to end up realist in these players
again<00:02:17.490> now<00:02:18.000> at<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> time<00:02:19.050> recording<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
again now at the time recording this is

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
again now at the time recording this is
still<00:02:20.069> haven't<00:02:20.400> sold<00:02:20.640> guys<00:02:20.880> which<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.300> really

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
still haven't sold guys which is really

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.360 
still haven't sold guys which is really
annoying<00:02:22.020> i<00:02:22.200> might<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.620> end<00:02:22.770> up<00:02:23.010> making<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
annoying i might have to end up making a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070 
annoying i might have to end up making a
loss<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.880> darby<00:02:24.300> guy<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.750> should<00:02:24.930> make

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
loss on the darby guy but we should make

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.020 
loss on the darby guy but we should make
profit<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.650> where's<00:02:26.250> Morgan<00:02:26.520> here<00:02:26.850> but

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
profit on this where's Morgan here but

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670 
profit on this where's Morgan here but
obviously<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.720> future<00:02:28.050> will<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.500> tell

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
obviously the future will have to tell

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.100 
obviously the future will have to tell
us<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.010> but<00:02:29.820> now<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:29.970> went<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.570> quite<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> risk

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
us that but now I went for quite a risk

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.020 
us that but now I went for quite a risk
here<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.590> searched<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.280> guy<00:02:32.459> up<00:02:32.580> again<00:02:32.850> there

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
here I searched this guy up again there

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.230 
here I searched this guy up again there
was<00:02:33.120> only<00:02:33.270> two<00:02:33.570> on<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> market<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.240> obviously

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
was only two on the market and obviously

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.090 
was only two on the market and obviously
we<00:02:36.360> paid<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> lot<00:02:36.990> less<00:02:37.020> for<00:02:37.500> our<00:02:37.650> other<00:02:37.860> ones

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
we paid a lot less for our other ones

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.860 
we paid a lot less for our other ones
but<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.550> thought<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> might<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.420> well<00:02:39.450> give<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
but I thought I might as well give it a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.860 
but I thought I might as well give it a
go<00:02:40.080> by<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.709> our<00:02:40.830> around<00:02:41.130> 38<00:02:41.610> k<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.090> list

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
go by this to our around 38 k and list

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.090 
go by this to our around 38 k and list
them<00:02:42.989> up<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.319> like<00:02:43.410> double<00:02:43.739> their<00:02:43.890> price

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
them up for like double their price

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.340 
them up for like double their price
because<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:45.000> no<00:02:45.180> harm<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.570> trying<00:02:45.690> guys<00:02:46.050> and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
because it's no harm in trying guys and

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.680 
because it's no harm in trying guys and
if<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.160> make<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> loss<00:02:47.670> we<00:02:47.910> make<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> loss<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.570> will

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
if we make a loss we make a loss it will

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
if we make a loss we make a loss it will
only<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.140> 10k<00:02:49.410> between<00:02:50.040> them<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.580> I'm

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
only be like 10k between them but I'm

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.250 
only be like 10k between them but I'm
still<00:02:50.940> confident<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.540> could<00:02:51.660> come<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:51.900> with<00:02:52.050> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
still confident we could come up with a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.170 
still confident we could come up with a
profit<00:02:52.680> between<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:53.070> two<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.250> them<00:02:53.400> so

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
profit between the two of them so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.550 
profit between the two of them so
obviously<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.630> go<00:02:54.810> ahead<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.170> list<00:02:55.320> them<00:02:55.410> up

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
obviously we go ahead and list them up

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.170 
obviously we go ahead and list them up
for<00:02:55.709> an<00:02:55.769> absolutely<00:02:56.040> ridiculous<00:02:56.640> try<00:02:56.880> stop

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
for an absolutely ridiculous try stop

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.449 
for an absolutely ridiculous try stop
trying<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> make<00:02:57.690> advantage<00:02:58.260> over<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:59.130> space

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
trying to make advantage over the space

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.540 
trying to make advantage over the space
in<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> market<00:03:00.269> now<00:03:00.420> released<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.110> one<00:03:01.290> for
