00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
productive so rather than it being a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.520 
productive so rather than it being a
hierarchical<00:00:50.960> structure<00:00:51.960> where<00:00:52.320> he's<00:00:52.500> in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
hierarchical structure where he's in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.779 
charge and he's delegating
responsibilities<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.010> he<00:00:56.250> he

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
responsibilities it's more like he he

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.970 
responsibilities it's more like he he
creates<00:00:57.480> resources<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.590> students<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.879> then

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
creates resources that students can then

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.630 
creates resources that students can then
take<00:01:01.980> charge<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.640> under<00:01:03.149> their<00:01:03.300> own<00:01:03.589> direction

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
take charge in under their own direction

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
take charge in under their own direction
so<00:01:05.640> we've<00:01:06.450> had<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.140> interesting

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so we've had this we have an interesting

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
so we've had this we have an interesting
relationship<00:01:07.710> where<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.909> certain

relationship where I have a certain

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.380 
relationship where I have a certain
amount<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> skills<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.320> software<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
amount of skills in software and the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.719 
amount of skills in software and the
internet<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.159> certainly<00:01:14.159> gadgets<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
internet and certainly gadgets and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.359 
internet and certainly gadgets and
widgets<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.240> able<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> provide<00:01:16.369> resources

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
widgets so I'm able to provide resources

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
widgets so I'm able to provide resources
to<00:01:17.580> all<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.210> whole<00:01:18.479> bunch<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> different

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to all a whole bunch of different

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
to all a whole bunch of different
projects<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> same<00:01:20.009> time<00:01:20.189> something<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> very

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
projects the same time something I very

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
projects the same time something I very
much<00:01:20.970> enjoy<00:01:21.439> thinking<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.770> how<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> user

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
much enjoy thinking about how the user

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.630 
much enjoy thinking about how the user
will<00:01:23.400> interact<00:01:24.000> through<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.110> website<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.280> me<00:01:26.430> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
will interact through a website to me is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
will interact through a website to me is
much<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:26.970> valuable<00:01:27.330> than<00:01:27.570> thinking<00:01:27.900> how<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
much more valuable than thinking how it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
much more valuable than thinking how it
might<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.380> feel<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.810> certainly<00:01:30.810> YouTube

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
easily and with the Electoral College
we're<00:01:45.000> more<00:01:45.869> interested<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.500> too

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
we're more interested in this too

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.340 
we're more interested in this too
because<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.399> mean<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.119> certainly<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.689> make<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
because I mean we certainly can make the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.370 
because I mean we certainly can make the
Electoral<00:01:49.860> College<00:01:50.009> website<00:01:50.540> look<00:01:51.540> well<00:01:52.079> and

Electoral College website look well and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.520 
Electoral College website look well and
feel<00:01:52.950> well<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.490> ultimately<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.990> probably

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
feel well but ultimately it probably

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
feel well but ultimately it probably
will<00:01:55.649> behave<00:01:55.950> best<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.700> acts<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> means

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
will behave best if it acts as a means

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
will behave best if it acts as a means
to<00:01:57.930> navigate<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> other<00:01:58.950> areas<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.340> the
