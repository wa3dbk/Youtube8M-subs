00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.259 

yeah<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> think<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.500> most<00:00:13.679> difficult

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
yeah I think the most difficult

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.680 
yeah I think the most difficult
complication<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:16.400> make<00:00:17.400> different<00:00:18.119> as<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.449> or

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
complication to make different as at or

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.279 
complication to make different as at or
beyond<00:00:19.020> has<00:00:19.650> been<00:00:19.859> around<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.310> 200<00:00:20.490> years

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
beyond has been around for 200 years

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
beyond has been around for 200 years
it's<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.420> you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.720> make<00:00:24.900> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it's a you know it just you can make it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.410 
it's a you know it just you can make it
faster<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.560> slower<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.670> let's<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:27.029> honest

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
faster or slower but let's be honest

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.950 
faster or slower but let's be honest
very<00:00:27.480> difficult<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.970> put<00:00:29.970> anything<00:00:30.210> next<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
very difficult to put anything next to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.670 
very difficult to put anything next to
at<00:00:31.080> or<00:00:31.320> beyond<00:00:32.450> innovate<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.719> had<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> idea<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
at or beyond innovate we had the idea to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.569 
at or beyond innovate we had the idea to
stop<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:37.219> mean<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.370> lying

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
stop it because I mean that's lying

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.500 
stop it because I mean that's lying
again<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.719> quite<00:00:39.840> stupid<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.510> invent

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
again it's quite stupid and you invent

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.590 
again it's quite stupid and you invent
something<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.260> improve<00:00:43.890> accuracy<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.420> then

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
something to improve accuracy and then

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
something to improve accuracy and then
you<00:00:45.750> can't<00:00:46.280> synchronize<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.879> properly

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you can't synchronize the time properly

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
you can't synchronize the time properly
in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> worst<00:00:49.590> case<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.890> lose<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> minute

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
in the worst case you lose a minute

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.689 
in the worst case you lose a minute
before<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.120> even<00:00:51.360> start<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:53.280> develop

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
before you even start and you develop

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.170 
before you even start and you develop
something<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.390> which<00:00:55.610> which<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:56.969> for

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
something which which which is good for

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
something which which which is good for
gaining<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> second<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> day<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.100> mean<00:00:59.280> that's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
gaining a second a day so I mean that's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.819 
gaining a second a day so I mean that's
in<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> way<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.480> doesn't<00:01:01.170> make<00:01:01.320> sense<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.770> us

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
in a way it doesn't make sense for us

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
in a way it doesn't make sense for us
but<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> put<00:01:02.879> even<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.750> convenience<00:01:04.350> factor<00:01:04.530> on

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but to put even a convenience factor on

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.480 
but to put even a convenience factor on
top<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.350> 1815<00:01:08.250> tour

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
top of that we now have the 1815 tour

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
top of that we now have the 1815 tour
beyond<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> only<00:01:09.360> wasted<00:01:09.750> Toby<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.229> stop<00:01:10.530> but

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
beyond that only wasted Toby on stop but

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.280 
beyond that only wasted Toby on stop but
you<00:01:11.310> pull<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> crown<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.840> second

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you pull the crown and the little second

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
you pull the crown and the little second
hand<00:01:13.590> will<00:01:13.860> jump<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> 12<00:01:14.610> o'clock<00:01:14.790> which<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
hand will jump to 12 o'clock which is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
hand will jump to 12 o'clock which is
the<00:01:15.780> easiest<00:01:16.140> position<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:17.159> synchronize<00:01:17.820> your

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the easiest position to synchronize your

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
the easiest position to synchronize your
time<00:01:18.330> perfectly<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.320> that's<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> idea<00:01:19.860> behind

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
time perfectly so that's the idea behind

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.600 
time perfectly so that's the idea behind
it<00:01:23.270> usually<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.420> had<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> last<00:01:24.840> year<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
it usually we had it last year in the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.100 
it usually we had it last year in the
saxonia<00:01:26.610> annual<00:01:26.909> calendar<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
saxonia annual calendar you know you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.990 
saxonia annual calendar you know you
pull<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> crown<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.890> jumps<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> 12<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.729> think

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
pull the crown it jumps to 12 I think

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 
pull the crown it jumps to 12 I think
it's<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.329> most<00:01:30.479> convenient<00:01:30.990> factor<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it's the most convenient factor but I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.750 
it's the most convenient factor but I
must<00:01:32.430> admit

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
must admit

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.330 
must admit
you<00:01:33.880> know<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.060> put<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.570> top<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.080> W<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.860> not

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
you know to put it on top of a W is not

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.930 
you know to put it on top of a W is not
that<00:01:36.610> easy<00:01:36.970> at<00:01:37.300> all<00:01:37.570> because<00:01:38.370> just<00:01:39.370> imagine<00:01:39.490> on

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
that easy at all because just imagine on

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.060 
that easy at all because just imagine on
top<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:41.050> have<00:01:41.230> to<00:01:41.260> put<00:01:41.560> something

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
top of that you have to put something

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.830 
top of that you have to put something
you<00:01:42.310> put<00:01:42.700> pressure<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.420> where<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.600> don't

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
you put pressure on it where you don't

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.620 
you put pressure on it where you don't
want<00:01:44.170> pressure<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.890> be<00:01:45.850> coming<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.270> top<00:01:46.450> of

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
want pressure to be coming on top of

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.250 
want pressure to be coming on top of
that<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.230> sit<00:01:47.500> they<00:01:47.890> hand<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.930> it's<00:01:50.050> quite

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
that you sit they hand so it's quite

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.370 
that you sit they hand so it's quite
delicate<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:52.060> why<00:01:52.240> probably<00:01:52.660> nobody<00:01:53.170> had

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
delicate that's why probably nobody had

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.210 
delicate that's why probably nobody had
it<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:53.680> far

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
it so far

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.080 
it so far
usually<00:01:55.060> comes<00:01:55.330> at<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.480> price<00:01:56.760> but<00:01:57.760> I<00:01:57.880> think

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
usually comes at a price but I think

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.880 
usually comes at a price but I think
that's<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.450> phenomenal<00:01:59.230> watch<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.680> it's<00:01:59.800> a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
that's a phenomenal watch and it's a

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.300 
that's a phenomenal watch and it's a
nice<00:02:00.130> new<00:02:00.910> member<00:02:01.300> of<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.680> 18:15<00:02:02.680> family<00:02:03.190> and

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
nice new member of the 18:15 family and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.550 
nice new member of the 18:15 family and
we<00:02:03.400> talked<00:02:03.640> about<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:04.090> earlier<00:02:04.480> I'm<00:02:05.230> pretty

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
we talked about that earlier I'm pretty

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.370 
we talked about that earlier I'm pretty
sure<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:07.060> watch<00:02:07.300> will<00:02:07.540> get<00:02:07.690> its<00:02:07.840> accolades

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
sure this watch will get its accolades

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.670 
sure this watch will get its accolades
as<00:02:08.560> well<00:02:09.179> because<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.360> simple<00:02:10.990> very<00:02:11.410> long

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
as well because it's simple very long

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.360 
as well because it's simple very long
and<00:02:11.890> zonah

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
and zonah

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.070 
and zonah
but<00:02:13.210> again<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:13.720> an<00:02:13.900> extra<00:02:14.320> little<00:02:14.500> bit<00:02:14.800> that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but again with an extra little bit that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.210 
but again with an extra little bit that
distinguish<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.560> be<00:02:17.740> or<00:02:17.830> from<00:02:18.100> all

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
distinguish this to be or from all

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.440
