pin layout here is very similar to the
pin<00:00:39.699> layouts<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.150> seen<00:00:40.360> a<00:00:40.390> lot<00:00:40.629> of<00:00:40.659> barns<00:00:40.930> with

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
pin layouts I seen a lot of barns with

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.020 
pin layouts I seen a lot of barns with
some<00:00:41.500> differences<00:00:41.979> in<00:00:42.040> some<00:00:42.400> similarities

some differences in some similarities

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.090 
some differences in some similarities
you<00:00:43.720> know<00:00:43.839> when<00:00:43.960> we're<00:00:44.110> doing<00:00:44.290> these<00:00:44.379> pins<00:00:44.680> the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
you know when we're doing these pins the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.560 
you know when we're doing these pins the
number<00:00:45.339> one<00:00:45.460> concern<00:00:45.760> is<00:00:45.820> safety<00:00:46.150> for<00:00:46.479> the

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
number one concern is safety for the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.109 
number one concern is safety for the
kids<00:00:46.600> safety<00:00:47.229> for<00:00:47.409> our<00:00:47.530> exhibitors<00:00:48.369> we<00:00:49.000> also
