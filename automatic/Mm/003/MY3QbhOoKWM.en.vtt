00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.700
 every time I see her, a new 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.660
 number that is the one looking for it all 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.660
 time he writes her songs 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.840
 songs and similar words 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.990
 when he wrote it only in our 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:37.950
 country then the verse of the song 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.950
 new series no 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:48.960
 but well we are finishing 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.960
 so if I leave you 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.360
 What's up 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.830
 because you did not tell me that that letter was 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830
 He said 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.330
 because you told me 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.330
 I had 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.009
 I could not 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.680
 I do not know if they want to have tea 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.740
 and mediation and now it means nothing 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.110
 to arbitrate does not mean anything is just 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.809
 a song a song that every time 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.580
 the cante you're going to think about him because he's going 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.020
 to be there because he wrote that 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.090
 Romantic 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.090
