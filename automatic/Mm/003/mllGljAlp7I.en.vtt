00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.300
 In this review I want to show the cartridge 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.900
 pioneer what is pioneer 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.960
 nick is the original cartridge 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.460
 which used once after it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.460
 he bought brand 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.760
 used and in principle as it were 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.830
 let's say many firms or businesses don't 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 bother themselves refueling 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.239
 they just buy the next original 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.239
 for 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.239
 replacements 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 it is easier for them to use 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.550
 spend 500 hryvnia than let's go 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 fill it for 70 there are such situations 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 such well, but in this case I purchased 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.309
 first ascent nick printers 700 printer 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 canon oh 7620 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.820
 I was able to cartridge 725 canon 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.420
 buy first ascent nick full analog 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:13.830
 canon and this promises packard 85 and here it is 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.399
 spelled 285 a85 and this is the original 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.450
 box 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.450
 This is the original cartridge bought it for 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 85 and who the cards and redeemed for 80 5 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.480
 hryvnia let it be completely empty 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.700
 I bought it 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.280
 empty looked convinced that it is right 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.950
 prohodnyk make sure it is very simple by 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.290
 drum it should be relatively 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.950
 pure comparatively as they say without 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.720
 potek 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.600
 it will burn about that this very 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:52.050
 year then i bought ink 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.050
 he bore himself and got the ink bought 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.050
 here 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.079
 mitsubishi 60 grams for 15 hryvnia this 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.770
 here I found it all on the market is worth times 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.590
 in two more expensive, well at firms I bought so 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.650
 become a bargained ace is much cheaper 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:16.989
 here then I just in case acquired 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.630
 drum acquired squeegee so -called 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.970
 squeegee it costs 20 hryvnia per drum 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.530
 within 40 hryvnia that is it just 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.350
 case that is, they are not the first 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:34.840
 the need is about to completely 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:38.380
 that is, roughly 15 hryvnia 15 hryvnia 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.080
 worth toners Putintzi 5 hryvnia worth 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.560
 cartridge first prohodnyak 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.830
 it turns out 85 plus 15 I for 100 hryvnias 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.620
 I bought the original cartridge he had 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.200
 designed for 1600 pages 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.380
 he already otpahal me literally two 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.660
 refueling it turns out well read here 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.070
 three thousand pages and here it is twice 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:07.840
 it is filled with 60 grams of course not enough 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.549
 he needs 80 well but i fall asleep 60 i don't 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.489
 they bother me to pour 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.090
 tuner something there happen to him and 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.680
 the most important thing here is the way still nasadochku 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.019
 such here it is worth the limits of 10 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.730
 hryvnia helps very well 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.799
 I will not show I will not 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.090
 bows how does he understand how it is himself and 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.109
 now the most important thing I give advice is that what 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.540
 do not speak in any service center 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.380
 that is, my first steps when refueling 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.150
 cartridge 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.160
 I was faced with the fact that I did not 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.160
 turned and drums and that is 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.200
 the new cartridge was braked i mean i 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.709
 I realized that probably better after all 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.590
 wear it on for refueling so here i am 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.410
 look open secret in something by the way in 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.870
 than a service center without bothering yourself 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.060
 bypass the problem wiped out pruners and 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.060
 grease that's all very simple 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:09.200
 you see the drum and is a regular Shreds 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.209
 baby talc for talc powder 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.420
 sprinkle neatly drum 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.070
 slightly and quietly turn it 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.799
 it wrung it elementary 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.210
 easy after only and will be with us 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.949
 spinning just fine 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.759
 center does not tell about it 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.960
 it is by chance i saw took it to myself 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.889
 most after I refill cartridges 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.139
 all sorts as you like, and that is 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.970
 I save an average of 70 hryvnia at full 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.259
 refueling i have so refueling 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:46.210
 can go 15 hryvnia 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:50.660
 toner another 15 hryvnia place 70 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.330
 and 15 hryvnia is not enough for about 1000 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.259
 something sheets because i'm not falling asleep 85 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.220
 gram a60 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:00.229
 This one is looking for sheets of the cost price 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.889
 print just as they say here just 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.169
