00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
and you'll notice from this load screen

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.140 
and you'll notice from this load screen
as<00:04:16.380> well<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.950> know<00:04:16.980> load<00:04:17.340> times<00:04:17.549> are<00:04:17.730> fairly

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
as well you know load times are fairly

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.580 
as well you know load times are fairly
short<00:04:18.540> we've<00:04:18.989> been<00:04:19.079> trying<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.320> keep<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.530> down

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
short we've been trying to keep it down

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.710 
short we've been trying to keep it down
and<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.489> UI<00:04:20.669> has<00:04:20.910> been<00:04:21.060> redone<00:04:21.299> here<00:04:21.510> as<00:04:21.600> well

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
and the UI has been redone here as well

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.960 
and the UI has been redone here as well
so<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.230> maps<00:04:22.410> look<00:04:22.560> really<00:04:22.800> nice<00:04:22.919> all<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
so the maps look really nice all the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.300 

alright<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:37.560> we're<00:04:37.710> getting<00:04:37.830> close<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.130> the

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
alright so we're getting close to the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.310 
alright so we're getting close to the
end<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.550> stage<00:04:38.730> here<00:04:39.000> when<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.720> was<00:04:39.780> previously

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
end of stage here when I was previously

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.110 
end of stage here when I was previously
the<00:04:40.830> best<00:04:41.130> way<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.280> get<00:04:41.430> through<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.670> stage<00:04:41.850> is

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
the best way to get through the stage is

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.430 
the best way to get through the stage is
the<00:04:42.150> sneak<00:04:42.540> that's<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.960> most<00:04:43.080> efficient<00:04:43.410> way

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
the sneak that's the most efficient way

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.170 
the sneak that's the most efficient way
to<00:04:43.530> do<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.800> but<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.640> know<00:04:44.670> there<00:04:44.850> are<00:04:44.880> people

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
to do it but you know there are people

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.970 
to do it but you know there are people
who<00:04:45.270> want<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.480> run<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.630> gun<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.020> also<00:04:46.860> it's

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
who want to run a gun and also it's

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.350 
who want to run a gun and also it's
inevitable<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.430> at<00:04:47.610> some<00:04:47.790> point<00:04:47.820> you're

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
inevitable that at some point you're

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.510 
inevitable that at some point you're
probably<00:04:48.420> going<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.930> get<00:04:48.990> spotted<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.710> another

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
probably going to get spotted so another

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.620 
probably going to get spotted so another
thing<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.790> I'd<00:04:50.880> like<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.000> point<00:04:51.210> out<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.390> how

battle works so let's go ahead and run

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.280 
battle works so let's go ahead and run
out<00:04:53.490> here<00:04:58.970> gameplay<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.090> pretty<00:05:00.120> smooth<00:05:00.540> you

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
out here gameplay is pretty smooth you

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.540 
out here gameplay is pretty smooth you
know<00:05:01.380> we've<00:05:01.530> actually<00:05:01.710> read<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
know we've actually read that the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.790 
know we've actually read that the
buttons<00:05:02.850> on<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.450> ps3<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.020> 360<00:05:04.350> version<00:05:04.710> to

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
buttons on the ps3 and 360 version to

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.100 
buttons on the ps3 and 360 version to
take<00:05:04.920> advantage<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.520> right<00:05:05.670> analog<00:05:05.910> stick

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
take advantage of the right analog stick

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.010 
take advantage of the right analog stick
so<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:09.000> face<00:05:09.180> buttons<00:05:09.540> to<00:05:09.660> control<00:05:09.690> your

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
so the face buttons to control your

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.690 
so the face buttons to control your
camera<00:05:10.380> here<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.950> can<00:05:11.100> use<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.370> right<00:05:11.520> hand

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
camera here you can use the right hand

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.750 
camera here you can use the right hand
lane<00:05:11.760> too<00:05:12.420> similar<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.720> an<00:05:13.620> extra<00:05:14.010> cash<00:05:14.370> or<00:05:14.490> for

lane too similar to an extra cash or for

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.430 
lane too similar to an extra cash or for
those<00:05:15.060> are<00:05:15.270> probably<00:05:15.540> more<00:05:15.780> accustomed<00:05:16.110> to

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
those are probably more accustomed to
