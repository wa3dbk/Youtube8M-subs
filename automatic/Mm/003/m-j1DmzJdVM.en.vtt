delivering to a client if you're a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.210 
delivering to a client if you're a
design<00:00:24.510> agency<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.680> let's<00:00:25.859> fire<00:00:26.070> up<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
design agency so let's fire up the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.150 
design agency so let's fire up the
simulator<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.560> you'll<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
simulator and what you'll see is the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.799 
simulator and what you'll see is the
simulator<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> simulate<00:00:32.730> both<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> iphone

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
simulator can simulate both the iphone

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.940 
simulator can simulate both the iphone
and<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.200> ipad<00:00:34.700> it<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.940> be<00:00:36.090> driven<00:00:36.899> by<00:00:37.170> menu

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and the ipad it can be driven by menu

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.470 
and the ipad it can be driven by menu
options<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.210> hot

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
options up here and they all have hot

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510 
options up here and they all have hot
keys<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.989> I'll<00:00:40.079> dive<00:00:40.590> right<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.160> show<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
keys and I'll dive right in and show you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.760 
keys and I'll dive right in and show you
what<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> mean<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.600> first<00:00:42.840> let's<00:00:43.079> fire<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
what I mean so first let's fire at the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
what I mean so first let's fire at the
simulator<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> let's<00:00:44.579> visit<00:00:44.910> our<00:00:45.030> website

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
simulator and let's visit our website

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
simulator and let's visit our website
like<00:00:45.960> say<00:00:46.500> ESPN<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.680> what<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.770> will

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
like say ESPN and what this will

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830 
like say ESPN and what this will
demonstrate<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.120> simulator<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
demonstrate is that the simulator is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
demonstrate is that the simulator is
properly<00:00:52.440> simulating<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.309> user<00:00:53.670> agent<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
properly simulating the user agent and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.750 
properly simulating the user agent and
being<00:00:54.539> detected<00:00:55.289> by<00:00:55.320> ESPN<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.309> other<00:00:56.460> sites

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
being detected by ESPN and other sites

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
being detected by ESPN and other sites
as<00:00:57.030> being<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.750> iphone<00:00:58.109> hence<00:00:58.469> we're<00:00:58.710> getting

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
as being an iphone hence we're getting

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.299 
as being an iphone hence we're getting
the<00:00:59.010> iphone<00:00:59.430> user<00:00:59.699> experience<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.770> same<00:01:02.010> goes

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the iphone user experience the same goes

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.969 
the iphone user experience the same goes
for<00:01:02.760> other<00:01:03.210> sites<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.809> well<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.140> i<00:01:04.680> pad

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
for other sites as well as i pad

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.820 
for other sites as well as i pad
detection<00:01:05.580> i<00:01:06.200> mentioned<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.260> hotkeys<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
detection i mentioned the hotkeys and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
detection i mentioned the hotkeys and
commands<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> commands<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.390> saving

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
commands we have commands for saving

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
commands we have commands for saving
screenshots<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.920> switching<00:01:11.460> between<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
screenshots for switching between the

two<00:01:12.150> different<00:01:12.390> simulators<00:01:12.840> changing

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
two different simulators changing

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
two different simulators changing
portrait<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.010> landscape<00:01:14.220> orientation<00:01:14.580> and
