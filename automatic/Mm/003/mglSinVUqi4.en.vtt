00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
usually if something's not clear then

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.360 
usually if something's not clear then
you<00:01:58.870> kind<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.260> stop<00:01:59.500> take<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.800> breather<00:02:00.040> and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370

figure out where you're at what you're

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.480 
figure out where you're at what you're
doing<00:02:01.870> but<00:02:02.560> that's<00:02:02.740> why<00:02:02.890> we<00:02:02.980> keep<00:02:03.100> training

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
doing but that's why we keep training

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.520 
doing but that's why we keep training
like<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:03.640> over<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.540> over<00:02:04.600> again<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.200> really

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
like this over and over again and really

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.830 
like this over and over again and really
it's<00:02:05.680> it's<00:02:06.400> just<00:02:06.760> in<00:02:06.940> your<00:02:07.030> head<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.510> is<00:02:07.690> what

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it's it's just in your head this is what

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.960 
it's it's just in your head this is what
we<00:02:07.930> do<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.740> how<00:02:08.770> we<00:02:08.920> do<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.460> so<00:02:09.880> if

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
we do and this is how we do it and so if

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.250 
we do and this is how we do it and so if
something<00:02:10.270> goes<00:02:10.300> wrong<00:02:10.450> then<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.990> really

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
something goes wrong then you really

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
know it really triggers an alarm in your

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.190 
know it really triggers an alarm in your
head<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.330> says<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.690> something's<00:02:14.110> not

right
we<00:02:14.740> need<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.010> figure<00:02:15.400> out<00:02:15.520> something

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
we need to figure out something

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000 
we need to figure out something
different<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.200> that'll<00:02:17.440> go<00:02:17.590> up<00:02:17.680> over<00:02:17.920> your

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
different so that'll go up over your

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.500 
different so that'll go up over your
head<00:02:18.070> just<00:02:18.220> kind<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.520> like<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> ski<00:02:19.000> mask<00:02:19.240> on

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
head just kind of like a ski mask on

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.660 
head just kind of like a ski mask on
this<00:02:19.959> day<00:02:20.230> they<00:02:20.470> allow<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.800> reporter<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
this day they allow a reporter to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.480 
this day they allow a reporter to
pretend<00:02:22.150> like<00:02:22.480> when<00:02:22.900> he<00:02:22.990> was<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> boy<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.830> he

feel the rush hoses and equipment come
out<00:03:12.790> everything<00:03:13.420> must<00:03:13.630> be<00:03:13.780> just<00:03:14.080> right<00:03:14.560> and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
out everything must be just right and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.070 
out everything must be just right and
yet<00:03:15.610> at<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.820> speed<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.420> critical<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.050> a

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
yet at a speed that is critical to a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.740 
yet at a speed that is critical to a
mission<00:03:17.530> when<00:03:18.310> we<00:03:18.340> go<00:03:18.640> inside<00:03:18.850> it's<00:03:19.420> filled

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
mission when we go inside it's filled

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.910 
mission when we go inside it's filled
with<00:03:19.870> simulated<00:03:20.410> smoke<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.640> now<00:03:21.820> understand

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
with simulated smoke you now understand

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.160 
with simulated smoke you now understand
you<00:03:23.400> need<00:03:23.580> real<00:03:23.819> teamwork<00:03:24.180> our

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you need real teamwork our

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.350 
you need real teamwork our
scenario-based<00:03:25.650> trading<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.370> huge<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:26.940> us<00:03:27.000> I

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
scenario-based trading is huge for us I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360 
scenario-based trading is huge for us I
think<00:03:27.390> we're<00:03:27.750> trying<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.230> recreate<00:03:29.099> that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
think we're trying to recreate that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.160 
think we're trying to recreate that
stress<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.150> get<00:03:30.360> out<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> natural

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
stress that you get out on a natural

stress that you get out on a natural
incident<00:03:31.940> now<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> next<00:03:33.330> one<00:03:33.599> it's

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
incident now in the next one it's

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.630 
incident now in the next one it's
difficult<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.440> explain<00:03:34.739> how<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.010> feel<00:03:35.430> when

difficult to explain how you feel when

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.250 
difficult to explain how you feel when
you're<00:03:35.790> inside<00:03:36.150> because<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.720> don't<00:03:37.080> know

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
you're inside because you don't know

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.729 
you're inside because you don't know
what<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:37.890> might<00:03:38.069> find<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:39.270> this<00:03:39.390> exercise

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
what you might find and in this exercise

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:53.730 
what you might find and in this exercise
we<00:03:40.739> found<00:03:41.069> what<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.640> fear

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.530 

okay

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.699 

from<00:03:59.540> there<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.900> learned<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.319> every

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
from there you learned that every

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.710 
from there you learned that every
exercise<00:04:01.099> is<00:04:01.580> different<00:04:02.000> there<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.569> no

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
exercise is different there is no
