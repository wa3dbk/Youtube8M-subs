00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 is everyone's and he was now and welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.779
 the pokemon information good guys 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.940
 yesterday Sunday before workshop Saturday hours 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.410
 I do not remember it, the magazine was published 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 famitsu which is one of the most magazines 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.150
 important internationally good 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.410
 in Japan so to speak inter but it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.359
 that is internationally known as well 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.859
 say it and there's been an interview 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.539
 quite serious with the president of the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.730
 pokémon company in which he has spoken of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.289
 very serious things we remember that makes a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 couple of days I thought I was not going to see a 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.740
 Pokemon game serious serious in a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.670
 spin-off like like the link battle or something 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.289
 well for the estuary but a game of 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 Pokemon seriously think that I was not going to see it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.239
 this year because in 2012 the announcement of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 little white 2 and black 2 was in January 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 and in 2013 the pokemon x age announcement 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.969
 it was in february therefore all 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.789
 serious serious pokemon ads 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.739
 serious was at the beginning of the year and this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.570
 year since January has passed and nothing has 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 last February and nothing and there is still no 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.800
 in plan or rumors of leakage or anything 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.469
 like that and we're already there 17 of 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 March therefore I think and I thought that 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.100
 no longer would be no announcement 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.809
 pokemon but this interview has given 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 what to talk about in the world of pokemon and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 let's talk a little about her the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.070
 life interview in which they have 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.280
 asked about various things about pokemon 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.200
 such and such but most 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.420
 is the question they have asked if they are going to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.369
 have some launch in 2014 this year 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.020
 because of fuck is that as I say 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.490
 They also talked about the topic of fuck if in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.560
 January there is nothing and in February 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.500
 you have not said anything neither nor nor nor nor avis 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.420
 I did not deactivate myself a rumor or 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.610
 something like that either nothing the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.680
 only rumor that there is left them below in 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.229
 the description is the rumor of the photo of 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.369
 instagram of nintendo pokemon in the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.619
 which will be a 3ds with the pokemon and 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.750
 a red folder in which I said good 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.060
 may be the rugby sapphire remakes 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.530
 remix that we expect so much like that but 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.910
 at the end removing that there has not been 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.409
 practically no news of 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.490
 pokemon nothing like that only 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.020
 be that you do not focus on pokemon 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.420
 draw that he has not focused much 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.830
 but now when they have already 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.690
 come out pokemon link battle so 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.979
 say it now they have focused and 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.810
 they want to focus a little more on the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.130
 new pokémon games I say if still 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810
 have been announced has not yet been 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.550
 announced the new pokemon games 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.810
 I guess they'll wait for the e3 we know 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.340
 that the e3 is the most conference 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.080
 important in the angels though 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.899
 Nintendo last year was not in the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.329
 angels I do not know if this year will be but 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.190
 I do not think so, even if it is not 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.910
 they always make fat ads and I think 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.490
 that this year 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.510
 it's going to be a pokémon game I think 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.430
 but let's focus on what has 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.680
 said the president of pokémon company 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.000
 when he has talked about 2014 they have said 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.990
 what's the president's name and if 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.420
 ishihara 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.010
 ishihara some more ishihara the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.200
 president of pokémon company him 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.080
 they ask about 2014 and he answers what 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.540
 next this year we will see great 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.010
 pokemon eye shots not a great 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.480
 launch of pokémon but big 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.460
 little releases so I think so 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.800
 that this confirms a game at least 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.210
 of desktop a game for wii that I 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.770
 I think it 's the wii one needs the union 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.030
 you need to start the eu you do not need 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.920
 sell units and I think a game 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.080
 Pokemon is perfect and now we talk 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.270
 of how perfect that game of 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.650
 pokémon now we talk about it and also 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.930
 spoken code of great releases 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.060
 Well, I suppose one of wiiu and 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.850
 others that he will talk about 3ds therefore 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.290
 the link patel has already gone out therefore 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.640
 great releases hits him 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.650
 it's not a big release either, he knew 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.400
 talk about a wii game and a game of 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.930
 3ds I guess and also says that a 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.030
 announcement of them 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.300
 is that this year we will also see a 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.610
 announcement that many people expect to see a lot 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.020
 therefore fuck what ads 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.430
 We hope to see us shit on me with 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.960
 the ad the only ad in which 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.910
 we want to see that is the announcement 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.680
 remix of ruby sapphire therefore 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.469
 I believe that 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.409
 that we will see an ad this year eye this 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:38.439
 year an ad does not talk about it being that 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.329
 the departure this year of the 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.219
 ad is that only says that this 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.859
 year will see an ad does not say go 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:47.019
 to see a game that many people wait for 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.150
 see therefore there I think 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.040
 that question of whether he talks about the announcement 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.209
 is going to be this year or this year is going to continue 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.459
 the game and the announcement will be within 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.659
 little streets when I doubt so not 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.829
 I know but at least this year 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.480
 yes it is confirmed every time you will see 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.310
 fat pokémon games I think it goes 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.599
 to be little with z but I think they are 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.189
 you carry the pokemon cti at the end of the year 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.139
 is going to confirm the remakes of pokemon 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.180
 ruby sapphire or even eye with this that 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.950
 no nonsense can be pokemon z 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.349
 this year although I live it a lot we put 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.329
 of is this year and in what could 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.739
 make the wii or sell a lot 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.690
 at least in Japan in Spain 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.699
 many degrees eye with this is that the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.220
 remakes of rugby sapphires are paraguay or 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.990
 a game with many graphics a remake 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.000
 ruby sapphire who swallowed with those 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.070
 graphics in plan I do not know how to see how the 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.630
 legend of zelda that's going to be your could 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.190
 be the magic guys can you be the great 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.530
 magic I do not know these are the things that 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.870
 you know this interview is the sea of 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.180
 interesting about the pokémon present 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.220
 company for the magazine 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.449
 very very interesting at least we know 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.789
 if you have confirmed that there are games of 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.500
 pokémon core 2 in this 2014 so 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.449
 we only have to wait, I think 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.060
 it's going to be for June the announcement was going to be 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.470
 by the end of the year the launch of the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.789
 game like this year pretty much a 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.990
 little bit maybe later because the power 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.520
 if pokemon x was published and announced 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.180
 better done it was announced in February and 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.979
 it came out on the 12th of the 11th or the 12th of October 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.419
 I do not remember very well now because if 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.310
 still not announced and will be announced 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.660
 in the e3 that will be in June because I guess 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.250
 that will be a little bit later will be for 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.080
 November inclusive for December 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.970
 I doubt it but now I do not know 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.410
 nor of blas I do not know when I do not know either 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.280
 when the pokemon was announced the pokémon 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:20.220
 black 1 and the few the pearl and the 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.259
 remakes of silver and gold I do not know when 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.490
 they announced themselves but the only two games 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.750
 last announced that was announced to 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.340
 beginning of the year and at the beginning year of 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.690
 I raise a python nothing so nothing 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.520
 boy I hope to taste this information 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.660
 at least because we do not know corpses 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.360
 one better pokemon than that always 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.500
 like so you can not leave anything like 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.210
 a comment everything you want 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.789
 It is always appreciated if you like this 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.020
 kind of videos in plan talking about 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.490
 so for instance news under 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.319
 comments and I think 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.940
 I think it's unfair, so you can leave 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.860
 one can support the video like everything 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.380
 that you want and nothing else we see ourselves inside 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.940
 As soon as you know something, you do not have it 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.020
 without any problem a greeting and 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.440
 until next time 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.440
 goodbye
