one will be a quarter of an inch shorter
and<00:01:15.630> you'll<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:15.990> why<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.350> bit<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.950> take<00:01:17.130> the

and you'll see why in a bit so take the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
and you'll see why in a bit so take the
longer<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.420> round<00:01:18.750> nose<00:01:18.869> pliers

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
longer one and some round nose pliers

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.920 
longer one and some round nose pliers
and<00:01:19.650> create<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.159> hook<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.610> each<00:01:20.970> end<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.740 
and create a hook on each end of the
headband<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.150> what's<00:01:24.360> supposed<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
headband so this is what's supposed to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.210

look<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.140> once<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.530> done<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
look like once you're done with the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to repeat this on the other side and now

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
to repeat this on the other side and now
you<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.360> homemade<00:01:39.780> headband<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:41.009> I'm

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
going to do is flip the headband open to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.319 
going to do is flip the headband open to
expose<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> bottom<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.729> apply<00:01:45.299> some

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
expose the bottom one and I apply some

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.660 
expose the bottom one and I apply some
superglue<00:01:45.869> onto<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.950 

then<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.700> push<00:01:49.970> them<00:01:50.060> back<00:01:50.240> together<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.900> I

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
then I push them back together and I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.540 
then I push them back together and I
clamp<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.320> down<00:01:51.350> with<00:01:51.650> some<00:01:51.680> paper<00:01:52.100> clips<00:01:52.280> so

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
clamp it down with some paper clips so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.010 
clamp it down with some paper clips so
that<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.760> can<00:01:52.880> dry<00:01:53.030> nicely<00:01:53.510> without<00:01:53.660> any<00:01:53.960> gaps

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
that it can dry nicely without any gaps

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.270 
that it can dry nicely without any gaps
so<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.080> do<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.620> other<00:01:57.740> side<00:01:57.830> as<00:01:58.100> well

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
so I do this on the other side as well

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.920 
so I do this on the other side as well
and<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.580> let<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.820> glue<00:01:59.030> dry<00:01:59.060> for<00:01:59.540> about<00:01:59.630> 10

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and I let the glue dry for about 10

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.470 
and I let the glue dry for about 10
minutes<00:02:00.470> or<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.220> while<00:02:02.000> we<00:02:02.120> wait<00:02:02.240> let's

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
minutes or so so while we wait let's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.410 
minutes or so so while we wait let's
work<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.200> ears<00:02:03.410> for<00:02:03.950> perfect<00:02:04.790> ears<00:02:05.120> you're

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
sharp edge like so and may I'm perfect

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.520 
sharp edge like so and may I'm perfect
cat<00:02:25.430> ears<00:02:25.730> okay<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:26.930> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.230> place<00:02:27.410> the

of just bend the base of the ears to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.560 
of just bend the base of the ears to
round<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.610> off<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.210> would<00:02:32.360> glue

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
round it off so that it would glue

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.500 
round it off so that it would glue
better<00:02:33.340> then<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.460> take<00:02:34.640> some<00:02:34.670> super<00:02:35.030> glue<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.390> I

better then I take some super glue and I
apply<00:02:35.780> some<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.290> sides<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.130> hear<00:02:37.460> the

apply some on the sides and I hear the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.490 
apply some on the sides and I hear the
ears<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:38.150> them<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.720> hold<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.110> there<00:02:39.140> for<00:02:39.290> a

ears to them and hold it there for a
while<00:02:39.560> until<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.160> dries<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.550> when<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.210> ready

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
while until it dries and when it's ready

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.390 
while until it dries and when it's ready
to<00:02:41.510> go<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:42.080> went<00:02:42.290> ahead<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.920> clamp<00:02:43.130> them

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
to go I went ahead and just clamp them

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.760 
to go I went ahead and just clamp them
down<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.910> I'll<00:02:44.270> let<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.600> completely<00:02:45.230> dry<00:02:45.740> for

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
down and I'll let it completely dry for

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.550 
down and I'll let it completely dry for
another<00:02:46.100> ten<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.700> fifteen<00:02:47.030> minutes<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.560> voila

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
another ten to fifteen minutes and voila

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.100 
another ten to fifteen minutes and voila
a<00:02:49.130> cute<00:02:49.520> little<00:02:49.670> headband<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.690> if<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.870> want<00:02:51.050> a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
a cute little headband now if you want a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.080 
a cute little headband now if you want a
Taylor<00:02:51.500> Swift<00:02:51.830> fit<00:02:51.980> out<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:52.640> add

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
Taylor Swift fit out you can just add

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.699 
Taylor Swift fit out you can just add
rhinestones<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:54.560> I'm<00:02:54.680> using

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
rhinestones to it and here I'm using

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.460 
rhinestones to it and here I'm using
scrapbooking<00:02:55.520> rhinestones<00:02:56.090> with<00:02:56.360> some<00:02:56.540> e6000

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
scrapbooking rhinestones with some e6000

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.930 
scrapbooking rhinestones with some e6000
glue<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.130> think<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.459> glue<00:02:58.640> works<00:02:58.850> a

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
glue and I think this glue works a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.040 
glue and I think this glue works a
little<00:02:59.030> bit<00:02:59.180> better<00:02:59.360> than<00:02:59.570> stupid<00:02:59.840> glue

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
little bit better than stupid glue

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.840 
little bit better than stupid glue
that's<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.470> my<00:03:00.590> opinion<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.459> can<00:03:01.610> try
