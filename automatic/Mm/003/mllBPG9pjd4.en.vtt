35 they're saying it's going to come by

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.110 
35 they're saying it's going to come by
at<00:00:29.929> 23,000<00:00:30.929> miles<00:00:31.050> per<00:00:31.320> hour<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.940> size<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
at 23,000 miles per hour and the size of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.360 
at 23,000 miles per hour and the size of
it<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.420> 1,000<00:00:34.170> meters<00:00:34.410> wide<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it is 1,000 meters wide so it is a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.639 
it is 1,000 meters wide so it is a
monster<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:37.489> like<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.579> said<00:00:38.640> some<00:00:39.059> people<00:00:39.360> are

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
monster and like I said some people are

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.220 
monster and like I said some people are
wondering<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:41.629> exactly<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:42.719> close<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
wondering you know exactly how close is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.950 
wondering you know exactly how close is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
this thing going to come well it's going

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.619 
this thing going to come well it's going
to<00:00:46.020> come<00:00:46.230> at<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.620> distance<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> roughly<00:00:47.309> 11<00:00:48.059> LD

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to come at a distance of roughly 11 LD

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.709 
to come at a distance of roughly 11 LD
which<00:00:49.559> puts<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> 11<00:00:50.550> times<00:00:50.579> further<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.420> than

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
which puts it 11 times further out than

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.250 
which puts it 11 times further out than
the<00:00:52.020> moon<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.940> moon<00:00:54.149> being<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> distance<00:00:55.170> of

one<00:00:55.440> LD<00:00:55.800> lunar<00:00:56.100> distance<00:00:59.180> here's<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> chart

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
one LD lunar distance here's a chart

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.319 
one LD lunar distance here's a chart
right<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.140> shows<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:02.550> encounter<00:01:03.149> when

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
right here that shows the encounter when

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.330 
right here that shows the encounter when
you<00:01:03.420> zoom<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.820> there's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
you zoom in on this you can see there's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.100 
you zoom in on this you can see there's
plenty<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> separation<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.270> we've<00:01:09.450> seen

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
plenty of separation there we've seen

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.100 
plenty of separation there we've seen
charts<00:01:10.530> where<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.369> looks<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.030> hit<00:01:12.330> no

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
charts where it looks like they hit no

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
charts where it looks like they hit no
separation<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.689> according<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
separation and according to the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.429 
separation and according to the
near-earth<00:01:16.380> object<00:01:17.220> program<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.990> enormous

lump of rock will pass within 2.8
million<00:01:22.439> miles<00:01:23.060> now<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.630> tiny

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
million miles now that is a tiny

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.010 
million miles now that is a tiny
distance<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.939> astronomical<00:01:26.939> terms<00:01:27.240> given

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
distance in astronomical terms given

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.859 
distance in astronomical terms given
that<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.579> larger<00:01:29.579> object<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.329> it's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that this is a larger object but it's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.890 
that this is a larger object but it's
not<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> come<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.070> said<00:01:32.310> between

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
not going to come like I said between

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.090 
not going to come like I said between
the<00:01:33.900> moon<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.229> Earth<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.710> we've<00:01:34.890> seen

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the moon and Earth like we've seen

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.560 
the moon and Earth like we've seen
before<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> close<00:01:38.540> but<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.290> close<00:01:41.570> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
before so close but not that close my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
before so close but not that close my
thing<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.460> keep<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.759> eye<00:01:44.880> on

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
thing with this is is to keep an eye on

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.870 
thing with this is is to keep an eye on
other<00:01:45.180> things<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:46.439> objects<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.610> nature

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
other things when objects of this nature

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.710 
other things when objects of this nature
come<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.890> our<00:01:49.890> area<00:01:50.299> we've<00:01:51.299> seen<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
come into our area we've seen in the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.840 
come into our area we've seen in the
past<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.470> Shilla<00:01:52.920> banks<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.790> were

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
past like Shilla banks they were

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.060 
past like Shilla banks they were
watching<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.479> whole<00:01:54.720> different<00:01:55.200> event<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.680> here

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
watching a whole different event in here

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.730 
watching a whole different event in here
comes<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.869> massive<00:01:57.869> fireball<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> came

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
comes this massive fireball that came

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.050 
comes this massive fireball that came
from<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> direction<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> Sun<00:01:59.790> or<00:01:59.969> what

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
from the direction of the Sun or what

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.580 
from the direction of the Sun or what
have<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:01.439> say<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.770> completely

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
have you and they say it was completely

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.080 
have you and they say it was completely
not<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.920> non<00:02:05.130> related<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.850> other

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
not you know non related to that other

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.639 
not you know non related to that other
event<00:02:07.069> came<00:02:08.069> from<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> opposite<00:02:08.729> direction

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
event came from the opposite direction

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.710 
event came from the opposite direction
so<00:02:10.649> what<00:02:10.979> else<00:02:11.160> are<00:02:11.370> these<00:02:11.790> objects<00:02:12.300> kicking

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so what else are these objects kicking

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.890 
so what else are these objects kicking
around<00:02:12.840> out<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.560> my

day after as this thing goes by because
like<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.090> said<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.450> could<00:02:22.540> perturb<00:02:22.980> anything

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
like I said it could perturb anything

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.869 
like I said it could perturb anything
else<00:02:24.159> out<00:02:24.370> there<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.079> send<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.200> our<00:02:26.409> way

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
else out there and send it our way

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.819 
else out there and send it our way
smaller<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.360> speak<00:02:31.409> but<00:02:32.409> that's<00:02:32.620> the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
smaller so to speak but that's the

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.849 
smaller so to speak but that's the
latest<00:02:32.980> when<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.400> comes<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.849> object

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
latest when it comes to this object

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.099 
latest when it comes to this object
making<00:02:35.859> its<00:02:36.129> pass<00:02:36.370> by<00:02:36.670> earth<00:02:36.909> it<00:02:37.599> won't<00:02:37.959> be

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
making its pass by earth it won't be

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.960 
making its pass by earth it won't be
back<00:02:38.319> by<00:02:38.530> till<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:38.829> think<00:02:39.040> 2033<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.819> is<00:02:42.939> a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
back by till I think 2033 but it is a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.009 
back by till I think 2033 but it is a
big<00:02:43.239> one<00:02:43.420> coming<00:02:44.140> rather<00:02:44.500> close<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.840> once

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
big one coming rather close but once

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.110 
big one coming rather close but once
again<00:02:47.139> I<00:02:47.379> do<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.620> think<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:48.310> have<00:02:48.909> anything

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
again I do not think you have anything

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.089 
again I do not think you have anything
to<00:02:49.329> fear<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.139> terms<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.680> thing<00:02:50.889> hitting

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
to fear in terms of this thing hitting

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.809 
to fear in terms of this thing hitting
the<00:02:51.220> planet<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:52.060> would<00:02:52.269> be<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:54.489> knocking

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
the planet it would be it knocking

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.670 
the planet it would be it knocking
anything<00:02:55.329> else<00:02:55.510> out<00:02:55.720> there<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:56.049> of<00:02:56.079> motion<00:02:56.530> is

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
anything else out there out of motion is

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.670 
anything else out there out of motion is
what<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.159> would<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.400> concerned<00:02:57.519> about<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.680> we

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
what I would be concerned about and we

what I would be concerned about and we
have<00:02:59.920> seen<00:03:00.250> quake<00:03:00.879> activity<00:03:01.889> pick<00:03:02.889> up<00:03:04.379> when

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
have seen quake activity pick up when

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.470 
have seen quake activity pick up when
bigger<00:03:05.859> objects<00:03:06.489> come<00:03:06.730> near<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.030> earth<00:03:07.180> it's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
bigger objects come near the earth it's

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.030 
bigger objects come near the earth it's
a<00:03:07.569> fact<00:03:07.900> we've<00:03:08.290> seen<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.859> time<00:03:08.889> and<00:03:09.099> time<00:03:09.310> again
