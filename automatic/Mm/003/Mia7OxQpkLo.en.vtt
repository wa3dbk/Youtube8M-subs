00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
only thing I calculate in anything I do

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.470 
only thing I calculate in anything I do
against<00:02:28.480> an<00:02:28.630> attacker<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.290> my<00:02:29.500> first<00:02:29.830> move

against an attacker is my first move
because<00:02:31.480> I'm<00:02:31.630> setting<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.400> after<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.550> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
because I'm setting it up after that I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.979 
because I'm setting it up after that I
don't<00:02:33.849> know<00:02:33.910> what's<00:02:34.090> going<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.269> happen<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.870> if

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
don't know what's going to happen so if

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.900 
don't know what's going to happen so if
I<00:02:35.110> if<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.380> knife<00:02:35.560> was<00:02:35.800> here<00:02:36.250> all<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.430> can

I if the knife was here all I can

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.970 
I if the knife was here all I can
calculate<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.989> after<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.860> don't

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
calculate is this after that I don't

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.470 
calculate is this after that I don't
know<00:02:39.190> George<00:02:39.580> might<00:02:39.760> punch<00:02:40.060> me<00:02:40.209> he<00:02:40.330> might

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.550 
tackle me so I don't know how I can go 1
2<00:02:46.480> 3<00:02:47.370> 4<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.730> too<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.299> too<00:02:49.360> technical<00:02:50.170> list<00:02:50.410> I

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
2 3 4 is too is too technical list I

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.500 
2 3 4 is too is too technical list I
knew<00:02:50.890> exactly<00:02:51.040> how<00:02:51.700> he<00:02:51.760> was<00:02:52.090> going<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.330> move

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
knew exactly how he was going to move

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.190 
knew exactly how he was going to move
and<00:02:52.810> react<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.790> yes<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.750> how<00:02:56.140> do

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
and react then yes but you know how do

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.900 
and react then yes but you know how do
you<00:02:56.290> know<00:02:56.380> which<00:02:56.739> attacker<00:02:57.099> or<00:02:57.670> how<00:02:57.849> the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
you know which attacker or how the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.880 
you know which attacker or how the
person<00:02:58.299> will<00:02:58.420> react<00:02:58.690> there's<00:02:59.110> different<00:02:59.680> pain

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
person will react there's different pain

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.289 
person will react there's different pain
tolerance<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.370> guy<00:03:00.489> might<00:03:00.640> be<00:03:00.760> under<00:03:00.940> drugs

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
tolerance the guy might be under drugs

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.449 
tolerance the guy might be under drugs
he<00:03:01.480> might<00:03:01.660> be<00:03:01.780> crazy<00:03:01.989> too<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:02.890> for<00:03:03.130> me<00:03:03.370> to

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
he might be crazy too so for me to

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.979 
he might be crazy too so for me to
assume<00:03:03.790> he's<00:03:03.970> going<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> move<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:04.540> way<00:03:04.720> it's

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
assume he's going to move that way it's

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.990 
assume he's going to move that way it's
completely<00:03:05.290> realistic<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> very<00:03:06.549> important

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
completely realistic so a very important

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.160 
completely realistic so a very important
thing<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.540> remember<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.459> your<00:03:09.459> first

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
thing is to remember is your first

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.390 
thing is to remember is your first
second<00:03:11.170> because<00:03:11.319> it's<00:03:11.620> surprise<00:03:12.040> attack

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
second because it's surprise attack

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.220 
second because it's surprise attack
that's<00:03:12.730> all<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.150> calculate<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.720> at<00:03:13.989> this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
that's all you can calculate so at this

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.199 
that's all you can calculate so at this
time<00:03:14.440> all<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.920> do<00:03:15.069> because<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.519> know<00:03:15.579> is<00:03:15.880> this

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
time all I can do because I know is this

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.180 
time all I can do because I know is this
after<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:16.870> it's<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.410> fuck<00:03:17.650> he<00:03:17.829> might<00:03:17.980> try<00:03:18.130> to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
after that it's a fuck he might try to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.830 
after that it's a fuck he might try to
reach<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.670> mic<00:03:18.819> he<00:03:18.970> might<00:03:19.150> pull<00:03:19.329> away<00:03:19.450> he

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
reach for the mic he might pull away he

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840 
reach for the mic he might pull away he
might<00:03:20.170> try<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.350> tackle<00:03:20.650> me<00:03:20.920> he<00:03:21.280> might<00:03:21.459> slip<00:03:21.670> I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
might try to tackle me he might slip I

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.520 
might try to tackle me he might slip I
might<00:03:22.150> slip<00:03:22.299> there's<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.600> million<00:03:22.989> factors

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
might slip there's a million factors

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.090 
might slip there's a million factors
that<00:03:23.620> might<00:03:23.799> happen<00:03:24.030> all<00:03:25.030> right
