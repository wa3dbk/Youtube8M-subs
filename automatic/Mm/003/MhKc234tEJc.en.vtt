00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.970
 noted that every minute that passes 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.260
 obviously the milan close to the scudetto 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.239
 at this time the situation of 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.680
 ranks the milan 53 points stands 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.420
 winning naples even if it failed 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.670
 in the double on Juventus penalty kick 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.379

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.729

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.649
 take their line from Parma while 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.890
 we came to the game individual of 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.619
 second time always result of parity 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.020
 0 to 0 between the parma and the juve per 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.689
 we were talking about substitutions 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.609

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.130
 tied for white napoli or down 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:23.899

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.899
 corner kick determined by the inter 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.570

 two teams with great technical dignity 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.820
