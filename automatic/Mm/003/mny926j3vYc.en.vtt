something that you're merely flying over
the<00:03:40.560> top<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:41.040> but<00:03:41.579> that's<00:03:41.790> just<00:03:42.030> my<00:03:42.180> two<00:03:42.239> cents

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
the top of but that's just my two cents

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.930 
the top of but that's just my two cents
and<00:03:43.010> probably<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.160> biggest<00:03:44.370> news<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.670> this

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and probably the biggest news of this

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.640 
and probably the biggest news of this
week<00:03:45.120> at<00:03:45.269> least<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.780> my<00:03:45.930> opinion<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.620> that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
week at least in my opinion is that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.380 
week at least in my opinion is that
Blizzard<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.340> toying<00:03:47.700> with<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> idea<00:03:48.030> of

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
Blizzard is toying with the idea of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.140 
Blizzard is toying with the idea of
allowing<00:03:48.630> players<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.320> buy<00:03:49.709> game<00:03:50.190> time<00:03:50.519> tokens

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
allowing players to buy game time tokens

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.960 
allowing players to buy game time tokens
with<00:03:51.750> real<00:03:52.110> money<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.920> they<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.280> then<00:03:53.310> sell

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
with real money that they can then sell

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.350 
with real money that they can then sell
or<00:03:54.239> trade<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.840> other<00:03:54.989> players<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.739> game

or trade to other players in game

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.970 
or trade to other players in game
effectively<00:03:57.360> allowing<00:03:57.780> players<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.350> buy<00:03:58.650> gold

effectively allowing players to buy gold
and<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.519> think<00:03:59.850> this<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.390> great<00:04:00.570> idea<00:04:01.019> hear<00:04:01.709> me

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
and I think this is a great idea hear me

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.430 
and I think this is a great idea hear me
out<00:04:02.030> reason<00:04:03.030> number<00:04:03.209> one<00:04:03.570> is<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:03.959> players

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
out reason number one is that players

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.800 
out reason number one is that players
