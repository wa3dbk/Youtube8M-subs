00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
know that was the main reason he got

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.860

wickets<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.669> both<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> innings<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
wickets in both the innings so and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
wickets in both the innings so and
spinners<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> bit<00:00:35.520> difficult

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
spinners you know it was a bit difficult

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
spinners you know it was a bit difficult
for<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> spinners<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> strong

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
for the spinners because of the strong

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.010 
for the spinners because of the strong
crease<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.190> across<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.670> field

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
crease that was going across the field

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.970 
crease that was going across the field
but<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> game

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
but I think you know as the game

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.369 
but I think you know as the game
progressed<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:42.420> adapted<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
progressed they adapted well to the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
progressed they adapted well to the
situation<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> started<00:00:44.430> rolling<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.820> good

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
situation and started rolling in good

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.229 
situation and started rolling in good
areas<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:45.870> us<00:00:46.110> winning<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.239> key

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
areas is about us winning the key

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.650 
areas is about us winning the key
moments<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.050> having<00:00:49.469> them<00:00:50.059> at<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> odd<00:00:51.390> four

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
moments and having them at the odd four

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.869 
moments and having them at the odd four
six<00:00:51.930> should<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> restricted<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
six should have restricted them to a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.380 
six should have restricted them to a
much<00:00:54.600> lower<00:00:54.840> total<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.239> other

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
much lower total and then the other

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.770 
much lower total and then the other
chance<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> bat<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.850> go<00:00:59.850> past<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.359> lead<00:01:00.539> but

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
chance to bat and go past the lead but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.369 
chance to bat and go past the lead but
we<00:01:00.960> didn't<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.800> fact<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.250> were<00:01:02.399> behind<00:01:03.030> by<00:01:03.379> by

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
we didn't in fact we were behind by by

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.520 
we didn't in fact we were behind by by
70<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:04.949> else<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.630> yeah<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.229> much

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
70 or else so yeah not not much

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.429 
70 or else so yeah not not much
difference<00:01:08.250> between<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.670> team's<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.090> think

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
difference between the team's I think

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.350 
difference between the team's I think
it's<00:01:10.439> about<00:01:10.710> getting<00:01:11.340> finding<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.060> way<00:01:12.299> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it's about getting finding that way to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.870 
it's about getting finding that way to
to<00:01:12.960> capitalize<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.159> key<00:01:14.369> moments<00:01:14.790> in

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to capitalize on the the key moments in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.440 
to capitalize on the the key moments in
the<00:01:15.270> Test<00:01:15.509> match<00:01:19.790> as<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> know<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> an

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the Test match as you know is an

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
the Test match as you know is an
exceptional<00:01:22.080> batsman<00:01:22.560> very<00:01:23.430> patient<00:01:23.970> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
exceptional batsman very patient you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
exceptional batsman very patient you
know<00:01:24.150> got<00:01:24.390> 100<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.930> 250<00:01:25.439> or<00:01:25.740> deliveries<00:01:26.220> which

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
know got 100 and 250 or deliveries which

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.740 
know got 100 and 250 or deliveries which
means<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.420> really

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
means you know you have to be really

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.899 
means you know you have to be really
patient<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.759> push

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
patient and you know you have to push

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
patient and you know you have to push
the<00:01:30.090> bowlers<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.710> pitch<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> ball

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the bowlers to you know pitch the ball

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890

in<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.579> areas<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.390> strengths<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.869> think

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
in your areas to your strengths I think

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.950 
in your areas to your strengths I think
that's<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:34.590> did<00:01:34.740> he<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:35.070> waited<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
that's what he did he was waited for the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.510 
that's what he did he was waited for the
deliveries<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.110> were<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> his<00:01:37.650> areas<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.369> he

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
deliveries that were in his areas and he

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.969 
deliveries that were in his areas and he
was<00:01:38.640> patient<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> long<00:01:39.420> time<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.350> has

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
was patient for a long time so that has

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.350 
was patient for a long time so that has
been<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> pick<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.520> his<00:01:41.670> innings<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> not

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
been the pick of his innings and not

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.520 
been the pick of his innings and not
only<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.290> whatever

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
only in this one you know whatever

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
only in this one you know whatever
innings<00:01:43.950> his<00:01:44.130> plays<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.729> know<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.299> waits

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
innings his plays you know he just waits

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.410 
innings his plays you know he just waits
for<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> bowler<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.619> pitch<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.790> his<00:01:47.970> area

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
for the bowler to pitch on to his area

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840 
for the bowler to pitch on to his area
so<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.259> he<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.439> brilliant<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.979> usual<00:01:50.549> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
so I think he was brilliant as usual you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.050 
so I think he was brilliant as usual you
just<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.329> Javed<00:01:52.140> played<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.729> harbajan<00:01:53.729> came

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
just like Javed played and harbajan came

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
just like Javed played and harbajan came
and<00:01:54.299> pretty<00:01:54.869> situation<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> game<00:01:56.009> taking

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and pretty situation at the game taking

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.010 
and pretty situation at the game taking
it<00:01:56.700> taking<00:01:57.299> charge<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> situation

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
it taking charge of the situation

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.700 
it taking charge of the situation
it<00:01:59.079> we<00:01:59.710> need<00:01:59.890> more<00:01:59.920> guys<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:02.200> take<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.560> that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
it we need more guys to to take on that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.039 
it we need more guys to to take on that
that<00:02:03.009> responsibility<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:04.119> doing<00:02:04.570> whatever<00:02:04.750> it

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049
