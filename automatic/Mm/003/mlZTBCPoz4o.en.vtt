00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.690
 is very good today gold hui 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.100
 cho welcome this new video 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.540
 which will I show you a new weapon 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.250
 perks and is that in this way you can 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.930
 call something that are the flashes 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.850
 greens that put the maps like that of 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.830
 headshot or like that of the barriers of 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.230
 good metal with this an update 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.120
 from June 27 to today add 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.039
 a new per maper things to say as 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.570
 I already said that way on the map of 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.010
 airways I'm not too sure if it's just 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.660
 on this map are a picture I've seen 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.190
 old at absolutely all the day of 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.680
 today only the east and irish I do not know if it is 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.170
 coincidence or if only in this but 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.879
 good this topic but not really you 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.890
 gives no benefit apparently it 's just 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.750
 as a reference interest rate what 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.420
 that is not going for the burger right now 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.850
 I will explain why this one but good for 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.379
 do is good to get this but 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.600
 what they have to do is spanair the 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.979
 box to buy many boxes this and 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.150
 eventually they will get it how 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.559
 they were when they got it good 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.510
 when they are buying cash and grab a 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.650
 weapon when they make this weapon the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.690
 green flash without doing 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.979
 absolutely nothing else then when 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.110
 once they get it, they are people 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.020
 who is going to say something or is going to say how 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.030
 this expression they say when 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.469
 they get a paper dog and they will not see 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 nothing different at the moment but 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.280
 they have to keep buying the box 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.960
 and once you leave the bags and totes and 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.700
 good and the box disappears and moves 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.080
 the place in that next place where 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.670
 you see to bake the box is going to be 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.619
 above the box will be what 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.270
 it would be this bear then this 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.770
 practically is what would be all the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.950
 bolt but I do not tell you it's no 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.149
 benefit some people say that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.920
 when the teddy bear is on top of the box 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.229
 they give you better weapons but it's not true 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.000
 because here I had the roots and he gave me 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.770
 a balin signa then I do not think it's 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.180
 that you get better weapons or some benefit 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.190
 not because there is absolutely nothing like that 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.780
 just as I already said a reference 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.660
 a buried because if you give an account in 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.310
 the trailer you see the teddy bear and you see 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.869
 that in that location is the box what 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.520
 which is telling us that the bear 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.110
 teddy is on top of the box but 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.640
 working is not like it 's in a 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.950
 place where it can be but 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.940
 above the box then well I say 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.740
 it's just me I think a 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.409
 reference something funny something here 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.789
 curious and then nothing if they say that follows 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.310
 I find some different than what 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.530
 I would be going to upload it but I do not think 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.790
 be something else and it would not be all 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.440
 gentlemen but you like this video 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.440
 take care, see you later
