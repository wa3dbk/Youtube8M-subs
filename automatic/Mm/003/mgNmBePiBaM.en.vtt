bash this because it's too small to do
anything<00:00:24.429> with<00:00:24.759> and<00:00:24.970> then<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.170> same<00:00:26.410> sentence

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.160 
regular gtx 760 will not fit in here
however<00:01:35.829> asus<00:01:36.820> makes<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.180> direct<00:01:37.360> cu2<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.049> is

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
however asus makes a direct cu2 that is

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.649 
however asus makes a direct cu2 that is
a<00:01:38.200> smaller<00:01:38.530> PCB<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.970> one<00:01:40.180> will<00:01:40.360> fit<00:01:40.540> in

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
a smaller PCB and that one will fit in

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:41.940 
a smaller PCB and that one will fit in
here<00:01:40.689> that's<00:01:40.990> what<00:01:41.140> i<00:01:41.170> would<00:01:41.259> recommend<00:01:41.740> on

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
here that's what i would recommend on

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.499 
here that's what i would recommend on
the<00:01:42.280> bottom<00:01:42.490> here<00:01:42.610> we<00:01:42.640> have<00:01:42.729> two<00:01:43.060> spots<00:01:43.390> where

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
the bottom here we have two spots where

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.330 
the bottom here we have two spots where
we<00:01:43.540> can<00:01:43.689> install<00:01:43.960> 2.5<00:01:44.500> inch<00:01:44.680> hard<00:01:44.890> drives<00:01:45.159> i

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
we can install 2.5 inch hard drives i

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.620 
we can install 2.5 inch hard drives i
guess<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.610> could<00:01:45.729> do<00:01:45.790> an<00:01:45.909> SSD<00:01:46.240> or<00:01:46.600> a

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
guess you could do an SSD or a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.510 
guess you could do an SSD or a
mechanical<00:01:47.170> drive<00:01:47.380> or<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.680> combination<00:01:48.040> one<00:01:48.490> of

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
mechanical drive or a combination one of

mechanical drive or a combination one of
one<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.240> each<00:01:49.479> whatever<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.049> want<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.530> can

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
one of each whatever you want you can

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.080 
one of each whatever you want you can
also<00:01:50.799> fit<00:01:51.040> another<00:01:51.250> one<00:01:51.430> up<00:01:51.610> top

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
also fit another one up top

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.940 
also fit another one up top
it'll<00:01:52.540> be<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.750> place<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.290> optical<00:01:53.740> disc

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
it'll be in place of the optical disc

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.649 
it'll be in place of the optical disc
drive<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.520> that's<00:01:54.640> what<00:01:54.759> I<00:01:54.790> would<00:01:54.939> do<00:01:55.299> but<00:01:55.540> if

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
drive and that's what I would do but if

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:56.850 
drive and that's what I would do but if
you<00:01:55.750> want<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.930> put<00:01:56.020> an<00:01:56.110> optical<00:01:56.439> disc<00:01:56.590> drive<00:01:56.740> up

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
you want to put an optical disc drive up

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.469 
you want to put an optical disc drive up
there<00:01:57.040> it's<00:01:57.159> got<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.399> be<00:01:57.460> slim<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:58.000> grab<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.299> and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
there it's got to be slim so grab it and

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.819 
there it's got to be slim so grab it and
throw<00:01:58.539> it<00:01:58.719> in<00:01:58.810> there<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.170> when<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.619> look<00:01:59.740> at

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
throw it in there and when you look at

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.649 
throw it in there and when you look at
the<00:01:59.890> back<00:02:00.039> this<00:02:00.520> unit<00:02:00.850> actually<00:02:00.969> it<00:02:01.329> was

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
the back this unit actually it was

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.590 
the back this unit actually it was
shipped<00:02:01.899> all<00:02:02.469> the<00:02:02.530> way<00:02:03.039> from<00:02:03.640> Taiwan<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.329> it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
shipped all the way from Taiwan and it's

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.270 
shipped all the way from Taiwan and it's
got<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.289> little<00:02:05.409> bit<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.680> bend<00:02:05.860> in<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.039> but<00:02:06.219> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
got a little bit of a bend in it but the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.730 
got a little bit of a bend in it but the
box<00:02:06.520> was<00:02:06.729> pretty<00:02:07.119> beat<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.229> hell<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.619> this

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
box was pretty beat to hell but this

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.040 
box was pretty beat to hell but this
material<00:02:09.340> here<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.940> back<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.360> pretty<00:02:10.660> thin

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
material here on the back is pretty thin

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.590 
material here on the back is pretty thin
aluminum<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:12.550> if<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:12.940> beat<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.270> up<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> little

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
aluminum so if you beat it up a little

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.850 
aluminum so if you beat it up a little
bit<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:13.990> get<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.140> bin<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:14.500> after<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.770> get

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
bit you can get a bin but after you get

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
bit you can get a bin but after you get
the<00:02:14.980> motherboard

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the motherboard

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810

screwed<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:17.010> shouldn't<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> problem

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
screwed in this shouldn't be a problem

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.310 
screwed in this shouldn't be a problem
but<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.240> would<00:02:18.420> want<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.750> note<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.110> has<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
but I would want to note that this has a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.750 
but I would want to note that this has a
little<00:02:19.590> bit<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.830> bend<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.220> back<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.610> mine

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
little bit of a bend in the back of mine

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.820 
little bit of a bend in the back of mine
that's<00:02:21.210> probably<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.570> because<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.710> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
that's probably just because of the

that's probably just because of the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
noticed that even though they're just

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.320 
noticed that even though they're just
really<00:02:51.810> sleek<00:02:52.800> looking<00:02:53.130> it's<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.850> kind<00:02:54.270> of

and then we have all the screws that

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.490 
and then we have all the screws that
you're<00:03:12.060> going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.210> need<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:13.080> know<00:03:13.110> install

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
you're going to need you know install

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.630 
you're going to need you know install
everything<00:03:13.740> if<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> motherboard

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
everything if you have a motherboard

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.760 
everything if you have a motherboard
that<00:03:14.790> does<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.120> support<00:03:15.420> USB<00:03:15.870> 3<00:03:16.170> well<00:03:16.380> there's

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
that does not support USB 3 well there's

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.010 
that does not support USB 3 well there's
an<00:03:16.890> adapter<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.370> there<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:18.000> plug<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.420> USB<00:03:18.540> 2

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
an adapter in there you plug the USB 2

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.810 
an adapter in there you plug the USB 2
header<00:03:19.320> into<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> motherboard<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.250> then<00:03:20.700> it

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
header into the motherboard and then it

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.199 
header into the motherboard and then it
gives<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.440> strange<00:03:22.489> USB<00:03:23.489> 3<00:03:23.760> type<00:03:23.970> header

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
gives you a strange USB 3 type header

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.060 
gives you a strange USB 3 type header
that'll<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:25.020> know<00:03:25.050> make<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.500> front<00:03:25.739> panel

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
that'll you know make the front panel

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.850 
that'll you know make the front panel
ports<00:03:26.850> work<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.570> not<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:27.840> USB<00:03:28.200> 3<00:03:28.410> speeds<00:03:28.709> of

ports work but not at USB 3 speeds of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.410 
ports work but not at USB 3 speeds of
course<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.459> then<00:03:29.640> let's<00:03:29.790> take<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.970> look<00:03:30.150> yeah

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
course and then let's take a look yeah

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.850 
course and then let's take a look yeah
well<00:03:30.600> we<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.290> inside<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.680> case

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
well we have on the inside of the case

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.160 
well we have on the inside of the case
here<00:03:32.070> now<00:03:32.190> we<00:03:32.430> do<00:03:32.610> not<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.239> lot<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.630> room<00:03:33.930> at

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
here now we do not have a lot of room at

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.380 
here now we do not have a lot of room at
all<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.709> would<00:03:35.340> not<00:03:35.520> take<00:03:35.670> out<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:35.910> front<00:03:36.180> fan

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
all I would not take out this front fan

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.150 
all I would not take out this front fan
leave<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.780> in<00:03:36.840> there<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.080> need<00:03:37.410> air<00:03:37.739> coming

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
leave that in there you need air coming

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.820 
leave that in there you need air coming
in<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.270> system<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.020> also<00:03:40.410> you're<00:03:40.739> not

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
in to the system and also you're not

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.890 
in to the system and also you're not
gonna<00:03:40.980> have<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> lot<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.370> room<00:03:41.820> for<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.750> know<00:03:42.870> a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
gonna have a lot of room for you know a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.470 
gonna have a lot of room for you know a

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
maximum height because again remember we

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.330 
maximum height because again remember we
also<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.720> SFX<00:03:49.230> power<00:03:49.500> supply<00:03:49.860> unit<00:03:50.190> I

also have that SFX power supply unit I

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.160 
also have that SFX power supply unit I
would<00:03:51.120> probably<00:03:51.209> couple<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:51.930> one<00:03:52.080> of

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
would probably couple this with one of

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.080 
would probably couple this with one of
these<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.590> know<00:03:52.739> what<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> get<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:55.850> get<00:03:56.850> one<00:03:57.000> of

ball gaming system in here but I would

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.930 
ball gaming system in here but I would
probably<00:04:34.080> go<00:04:34.380> fm2<00:04:34.830> with<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.400> just<00:04:35.700> for<00:04:35.820> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
probably go fm2 with this just for the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.360 
probably go fm2 with this just for the
price<00:04:36.150> performance<00:04:36.420> ratio<00:04:37.130> fm2

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
price performance ratio fm2

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.480 
price performance ratio fm2
with<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.390> know<00:04:39.420> like<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.690> decent<00:04:40.020> GPU<00:04:40.650> 5800

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
with the you know like a decent GPU 5800

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.910 
with the you know like a decent GPU 5800
K<00:04:41.640> or<00:04:41.820> 6800<00:04:42.480> K<00:04:42.600> hell<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.470> can<00:04:43.620> even<00:04:43.650> go<00:04:43.890> a

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
K or 6800 K hell you can even go a

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.800 
K or 6800 K hell you can even go a
little<00:04:44.130> bit<00:04:44.340> cheaper<00:04:45.120> with<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.570> then

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
little bit cheaper with that and then

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.870 
little bit cheaper with that and then
put<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.050> 760<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:46.890> I<00:04:47.070> know<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.640> sounds

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
put the 760 in there I know it sounds

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.390 
put the 760 in there I know it sounds
crazy<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.240> it'll<00:04:48.960> be<00:04:49.050> really<00:04:49.080> fast<00:04:49.530> so<00:04:50.250> that's

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
crazy but it'll be really fast so that's

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
crazy but it'll be really fast so that's
probably<00:04:50.640> what<00:04:50.820> I<00:04:50.850> would<00:04:51.000> do<00:04:51.060> would<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.270> lot

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
probably what I would do would be a lot

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.390 
probably what I would do would be a lot
cheaper<00:04:51.450> then<00:04:52.230> going<00:04:52.500> full<00:04:52.710> out<00:04:52.740> as<00:04:53.040> well<00:04:53.280> if

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
cheaper then going full out as well if

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.370 
cheaper then going full out as well if
you<00:04:53.490> want<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.880> ultimate<00:04:54.060> performance<00:04:54.570> go

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
you want the ultimate performance go

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.700 
you want the ultimate performance go
ahead<00:04:55.620> get<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.010> Haswell<00:04:56.430> ITX<00:04:56.940> system<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:58.110> put

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
ahead get a Haswell ITX system and put

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.690 
ahead get a Haswell ITX system and put
that<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:59.010> here<00:04:59.510> with<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.660> Acer<00:05:00.960> 760<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.770> you

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
that in here with the Acer 760 and you

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.970 
that in here with the Acer 760 and you
will<00:05:02.820> be<00:05:02.940> all<00:05:03.120> good<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.900> go<00:05:03.930> because<00:05:04.710> have
