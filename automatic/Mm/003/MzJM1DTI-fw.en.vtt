it didn't work out recorded so I'm a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.290 
it didn't work out recorded so I'm a
little<00:00:54.570> bit<00:00:54.840> frustrated<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.489> have

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
little bit frustrated about that I have

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.200 
little bit frustrated about that I have
to<00:00:57.449> redo<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> again<00:00:59.480> but<00:01:01.370> hopefully<00:01:02.370> it'll<00:01:02.910> be

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to redo it again but hopefully it'll be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.299 
to redo it again but hopefully it'll be
as<00:01:03.359> good<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.989> might<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.769> good<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
as good it might not be as good as the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
as good it might not be as good as the
first<00:01:05.610> recording<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.080> really

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
first recording but I because I really

first recording but I because I really
spent<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> lot<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> time<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:12.110> it's

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
spent a lot of time on that one but it's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.639 
spent a lot of time on that one but it's
basically<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> same<00:01:14.159> idea<00:01:16.939> it's<00:01:17.939> another<00:01:18.210> one
