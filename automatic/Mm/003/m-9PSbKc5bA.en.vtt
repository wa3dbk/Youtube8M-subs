it's slider video since I'm playing the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.270 
it's slider video since I'm playing the
PC<00:00:08.550> version<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.480> anybody<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.469> any<00:00:10.710> system<00:00:11.250> can

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
PC version so anybody on any system can

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.150 
PC version so anybody on any system can
look<00:00:11.580> at<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.929> make<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.679> changes

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
look at this and just make the changes

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.880 
look at this and just make the changes
and<00:00:17.630> see<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.050> from<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.529> this

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and see what you get from them is this

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.269 
and see what you get from them is this
is<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.130> all<00:00:20.430> all<00:00:21.210> pro<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.070> pro

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
is on all all pro I think it's all pro

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.150 
is on all all pro I think it's all pro
or<00:00:23.519> maybe<00:00:23.730> all-star<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> don't<00:00:24.480> know<00:00:25.070> yeah<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
or maybe all-star I don't know yeah it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:36.560 
or maybe all-star I don't know yeah it
is<00:00:26.279> all-star

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.670 

I've<00:00:37.079> had<00:00:37.320> good<00:00:37.530> results<00:00:37.679> with<00:00:38.100> them<00:00:39.680> just

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
I've had good results with them just

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.299 
I've had good results with them just
drop<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> controller<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.269> they're<00:00:48.269> the<00:00:48.390> same

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
drop the controller and they're the same

00:00:49.309 --> 00:01:00.070 
drop the controller and they're the same
except<00:00:50.309> tendencies<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.089> little<00:00:51.300> different

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.800 

so<00:01:00.560> it's<00:01:00.710> supposed<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:01.010> be<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.250> same<00:01:01.810> and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
so it's supposed to be the same and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.770 
so it's supposed to be the same and
tweaking<00:01:03.200> them<00:01:04.059> so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
tweaking them so

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.460 
tweaking them so
it's<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.740> see

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.380 

go<00:01:10.920> through<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> slow

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.750 

this<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.260> sang

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.679 

this<00:01:22.360> also<00:01:22.630> be<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.140> sign<00:01:23.380> that's<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:23.830> messed<00:01:24.100> up

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.420 

I've<00:01:28.259> tested<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:28.770> over<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.280> eight<00:01:29.490> games

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
I've tested this over about eight games

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.859 
I've tested this over about eight games
there's<00:01:32.430> still<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:32.909> holes<00:01:33.149> I'll<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
there's still some holes I'll get to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
there's still some holes I'll get to
those

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.660 

Sam<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.690> think<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> passing<00:01:47.040> still<00:01:47.340> has<00:01:47.430> some

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
Sam I think the passing still has some

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.960 
Sam I think the passing still has some
issues<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.090> sliders<00:01:48.990> probably<00:01:49.350> can't<00:01:49.560> fix

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
issues that sliders probably can't fix

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
issues that sliders probably can't fix
but<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.390> I'd<00:01:51.780> say<00:01:52.020> 2k14<00:01:52.560> reason<00:01:52.950> why<00:01:53.040> I'm

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
but it's I'd say 2k14 reason why I'm

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.310 
but it's I'd say 2k14 reason why I'm
doing<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.760> 2k14<00:01:54.630> these<00:01:55.050> sliders

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
doing this is I think 2k14 these sliders

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.730 
doing this is I think 2k14 these sliders
is<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.700> good<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.119> they<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.110> I've<00:01:58.259> done<00:01:58.470> I

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
is as good as they get and I've done I

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.180 
is as good as they get and I've done I
played<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.100> off<00:01:59.220> since<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.360> very<00:02:00.570> first<00:02:00.630> one

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
played them off since the very first one

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.600 
played them off since the very first one
they<00:02:02.190> didn't<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.550> a<00:02:02.610> number<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
they didn't have a number so this is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.190 
they didn't have a number so this is
probably<00:02:07.250> solid<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> game<00:02:08.700> gates<00:02:09.200> with

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
probably solid as a game gates with

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.890 
probably solid as a game gates with
these<00:02:10.410> sliders

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.530 

we'll<00:02:15.500> go<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.040> explain<00:02:16.489> them<00:02:16.730> if<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.450> have

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
we'll go in and explain them if you have

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.210 
we'll go in and explain them if you have
any<00:02:17.720> questions<00:02:18.319> like<00:02:18.560> why<00:02:18.739> do<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.890> put<00:02:19.069> this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
any questions like why do you put this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.630 
any questions like why do you put this
there<00:02:21.129> I'll<00:02:22.129> let<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.430> know

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
there I'll let you know

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.080 
there I'll let you know
I<00:02:23.349> will<00:02:24.349> field<00:02:24.680> questions<00:02:25.160> I'll<00:02:25.849> probably

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
I will field questions I'll probably

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.839 
I will field questions I'll probably
answer<00:02:26.599> them<00:02:26.830> faster<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.129> comments<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.760> I

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
answer them faster in the comments and I

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.110 
answer them faster in the comments and I
normally<00:02:29.030> would<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.690> other<00:02:29.870> videos<00:02:34.060> pewter<00:02:35.060> is

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
normally would on other videos pewter is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.650 
normally would on other videos pewter is
a<00:02:35.209> little<00:02:35.450> different

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.520 

I<00:02:44.750> changed<00:02:45.650> some<00:02:46.870> human<00:02:47.870> settings<00:02:48.260> because<00:02:48.500> I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
I changed some human settings because I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.140 
I changed some human settings because I
think<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.100> computer<00:02:49.520> should<00:02:49.790> put<00:02:50.000> back<00:02:50.180> more

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
think the computer should put back more

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.250 
think the computer should put back more
but<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.180> don't<00:02:53.450> even<00:02:53.570> know<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.990> really

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
but I don't even know if it really

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.710 
but I don't even know if it really
affects<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:55.250> team<00:02:55.460> you<00:02:55.640> using<00:02:56.030> if<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.510> does

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
affects the team you using if it does

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.930 
affects the team you using if it does
these<00:02:57.140> are<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.470> ones<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.860> chose<00:02:58.460> to<00:02:58.760> raise

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
these are the ones I chose to raise

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.610 
these are the ones I chose to raise
because<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.540> think<00:03:00.020> they<00:03:00.200> should<00:03:00.350> be<00:03:00.440> higher

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
because I think they should be higher

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.309 
because I think they should be higher
across<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.130> board

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:17.520 

and<00:03:09.739> get<00:03:10.159> to<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.340> fouls

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.350 

this<00:03:18.160> could<00:03:18.430> probably<00:03:18.610> go<00:03:18.850> up<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.060> little<00:03:19.209> bit

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
this could probably go up a little bit

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.750 
this could probably go up a little bit
more

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.610 

the<00:03:27.330> same<00:03:27.750> song<00:03:28.110> even<00:03:28.260> switch<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.770> around

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.770 

charging<00:03:32.640> still<00:03:33.640> doesn't<00:03:34.030> get<00:03:34.150> called<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.630> lot

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
charging still doesn't get called a lot

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.930 
charging still doesn't get called a lot
of<00:03:34.930> times<00:03:35.140> when<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.410> should<00:03:35.830> but<00:03:36.490> if<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.730> turn

too<00:03:38.530> many<00:03:38.620> flops<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.600> I'm<00:03:40.600> gonna<00:03:40.750> bump<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.110> to

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
too many flops so I'm gonna bump it to

too many flops so I'm gonna bump it to
60<00:03:41.890> but<00:03:42.670> if<00:03:42.760> you're<00:03:42.880> seeing<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.300> lot<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.510> flops

and that's just that's just an issue the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.060 
and that's just that's just an issue the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
game adds a little bit more blocking

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.040 
game adds a little bit more blocking
than<00:03:51.070> 50<00:03:51.490> but<00:03:52.260> that's<00:03:53.260> pretty<00:03:53.380> much<00:03:53.500> it
