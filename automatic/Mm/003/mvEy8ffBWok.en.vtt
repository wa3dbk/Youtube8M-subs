00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:04.499
 the MDC Bayreuth is presented to them already possible 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.339
 for the BBC 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.070
 in a derby for lending it will indeed rise in the BBL 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.419
 the Brose Baskets 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.060
 the Bambergern one 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.669
 far better the winner 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.669
 but it also had beautiful scenes » 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.180
 the Motion RIM 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.620
 and great fight on the bank of the BBC 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.820
 through the noise or at the annual reception 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.680
 I think it's Mandriva's place, we're immune from the first test minute 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.590
 want to have fought the team done scary good job 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.260
 in order to have the new class of by, the team played with them around 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.490
 already percent have been facing problems in the last 7 days 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.809
 billions again and how to measure them and beat them more 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.219
 and because we knew before that we were struggling with injuries 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.770
 US-wide and Coco turned out but we gave everything 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.290
 have shown one that we can really keep up 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.380
 which roles 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490
 Michel de Carolis some scenes 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 the WDCS convinced 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420
 especially in defense 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420
 a big strength in Derby 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 or you simply took the Brose Baskets 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 especially in the fourth quarter then reach 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 be prevented with authorities 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.970
 Johnson settle us but very much so if you pick that up again 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.900
 or percent have moved to the basket 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.770
 after this knitting pattern the BBC Arab Brose Baskets stalks 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.300
 shorten continue 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.470
 the hopeless backlog 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.830
 and 8 minutes before the end it even needs a sensation when I am 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 now free-throw and Bayreuth was only 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.490
 to have a run the BBC at this stage 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.850
 you can get it from the back and you can see the whole team 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.520
 highlight 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.870
 «Of course, in hindsight, more swinging minutes have come 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.340
 but we did a very good job around the circles against the camera lens Canon 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.860
 Borgert very well defended but also Pete Campbell have made good play 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.230
 in Egypt today what a high hit rate the pulse of the currently one 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.690
 Schaff she spreads the light over in front of us taking advantage of team performance 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.939
 and you have to be there 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.699
 but then drive so far 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.859
 The Brose Baskets showed why they are unbeaten 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.549
 Thyra pattered in this crucial phase 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.259
 a delay is well was the result 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.129
 us we should have done better than just three points behind 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.549
 were 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.959
 but then we were ready to top the ceiling following the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.719
 Bamberger have thrown out of all places and especially hit 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.099
 but at that moment lost but overlooked the game 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.150
 and, of course, the scenes comes from Burma's routine of course 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.280
 a run 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.290
 Of course he knows that they can win short matches and they have them 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.769
 Of course, the decisive moments are stupid 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.979
 who play this turn 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.490
 the score as a freer 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.999
 who the greater effort and yield 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.820
 too late 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.820
 the compliment 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.189
 so you can still cards others 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.599
 not to bring performance that would of course be great would be all 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.640
 Actors are rare 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.880
 In order to experience in Minden in the hall that is so one of euphoria is such a 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.360
 Insider who does not understand our own word is a big thank you 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.480
 simply not included in that worn from the first last minute on 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.609
 under power is under me that with her for real home game 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.410
 then there was the incident and Jörg Brämer 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.480
 the BDC Mühleck goes with the ball in the direction of Baumberger Joan Clos advised 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.810
 the keeper Marco Frey more and rushed his head to the post office 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.040
 comes to a heated romping in the episode of the place had to 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.410
 possible prehistory the Rheinpfalz a minute earlier 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.230
 Brühl meets men with his brother 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.250
 on the neck of the offender or Borbely life I believe Jericho old with the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.620
 Foot to the ball the player kicked but his ball right there 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.350
 It looked like he wanted to go to Tripoli but I think that's exactly what he wanted 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.880
 Not 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.240
 It was actually quite possible that both had to be disappointed 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:33.020
 good possible but also 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 that the WBC lost the derby in the end 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830
 He played fans' hearts with a merchant ship 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.960
 Tir BBC Bayreuth is already presenting them furniture percent
