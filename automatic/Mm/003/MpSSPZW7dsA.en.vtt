00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.810
 when you want to lose a few kilos something 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.970
 very common is to stop eating for 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.860
 try to reach a weight that we have 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 put as objective in a way 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.599
 random but the truth is that the best 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.180
 it will always be calculate the percentage 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.640
 of body fat to know in a good way 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.650
 more precise how much weight we need 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 lose since many times we do not 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.030
 there are as many kilos as in principle 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.739
 we believed that's why today we're going to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 show you how to measure body fat 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.110
 step by step so you can start 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 your weight loss process 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.220
 Knowing perfectly your 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.839
 body composition there are several 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.030
 ways to calculate the percentage of 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.530
 body fat but today we're going to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.260
 focus on the best method 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.790
 quality-price the likud vitro also 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.900
 known as caliper or adif or meter 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.270
 obviously to use this method 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.670
 you need to have one but fortunately 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.420
 You can get a single meter by 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.280
 just a couple of euros on the internet 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.710
 there are several ways to measure fat 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.150
 body with the meter peak in which 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.430
 they use different numbers of 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.780
 measurements but we're going to 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.030
 focus on the formula of the six 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.830
 clients that is the most used and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.520
 enough to measure body fat 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.200
 reliably unfortunately you're not going to 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.509
 be able to make the measurements yourself 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.820
 since the results probably 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.530
 they would be quite altered so 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.530
 you will have to ask someone else for help 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.410
 The first thing you should know is that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.450
 involves cutaneous is the double layer of skin 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.270
 with its respective adipose tissue the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.700
 underlying that is formed when you use your 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.580
 thumb and forefinger as if they were a 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.800
 clamp at the time of forming the fold 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.110
 skin or adipose panniculus with fingers 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.720
 you must make sure that you are only 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.190
 taking skin with its respective fat and 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.950
 is not holding part of the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.660
 musculature this is easy to know and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.440
 just ask the person you are 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.540
 measuring that said muscle contracts 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.820
 when measuring with the peak meter 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.430
 you must do it at a distance of 1 or 2 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.950
 centimeters of your fingers in the most 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.410
 close to the body and wait 2 seconds 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.570
 before taking the measurement since if 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.360
 there is a lot of fat the meter peak still not 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.220
 will have finished descending either 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.500
 you must release the pint with your fingers in 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.050
 no time until you have taken the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.270
 measure 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.910
 another important thing is the position of the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.840
 caliper this should form an angle of 90 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.629
 degrees with the fold to be measured 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.129
 each measurement is taken three times if a 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.250
 same measure is repeated twice 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.590
 we will use that but if we get three 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.510
 different measures is made an average is 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.540
 say they all add up and it's divided between 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.730
 three but that does not mean it's worth 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.650
 any measurement since if there are more 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 two millimeters difference between 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.810
 the measurements is that there has been an error 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.720
 and you will have to take the measurements again 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.489
 crease ups scapular this fold 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.200
 take in the back just below the 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.420
 Scapula takes about two centimeters 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.180
 on the lower angle of the scapula 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.370
 obliquely at an angle approximately 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.799
 of 45 degrees compared to the vertical 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.540
 to take the first thing, the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.209
 lower part of the scapula with the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.480
 index finger to then proceed to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.319
 make the clamp with the thumb 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.540
 and main the skin fold should 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.420
 take it upright and it should be 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.879
 measure approximately in the middle of the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.010
 back of the arm halfway 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.110
 between the shoulder and the elbow 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.450
 Ideally, the arm should be bent 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.489
 so that the triceps muscle remains 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.230
 stretched making the fold easier 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.230
 cutaneous is free of muscle mass 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.890
 and abdominal this is a fold that is 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.390
 Take it upright and it's located 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.110
 next to the navel about two 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.110
 centimeters approximately 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.889
 this fold is just over the 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.630
 iliac crest in the auxiliary midline 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.810
 the fold has to be taken forming a 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.120
 Approximate angle of 45 degrees 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.520
 to locate the point accurately 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.520
 first to locate the edge more 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.230
 superior and external of the iliac crest 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.060
 for this you can help by pressing 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.060
 with both hands on the sides of the 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.800
 waist to locate the bone the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.310
 measure should be taken at its intersection 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.190
 with the auxiliary medium line that would be the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.560
 line that goes from the iliac spine 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.540
 anterior superior to the armpit if you 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.120
 it's hard to locate it, you can draw some 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.340
 lines with a ballpoint pen so you take it 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.620
 of measures is easier the person to 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.969
 measure must cross the arm in front 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.519
 of the chest 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.009
 quadricipital fold or anterior thigh 

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.809
 the fold is taken in the middle of the thigh 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.299
 anterior halfway between the knee 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:18.549
 and the inguinal line there are several 

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:21.549
 measurement techniques the first would be 

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:23.709
 sitting with the leg at 90 degrees if there 

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:26.079
 difficulty and tension of the quadriceps 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:28.299
 does not allow to take the crease the person to 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:30.789
 measuring can help by pressing with both 

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:32.589
 hands down the lower thigh and 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.169
 facilitate thus the taking of the panicle 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:37.119
 adipose can also stand up 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.459
 supporting all the weight on the leg 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:41.259
 contrary to measuring advancing the leg 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.860
 evaluate and maintain it slightly 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.860
 flexed 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.289
 I got fibula to the middle leg the crease 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.209
 it is taken on the inside of the 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.909
 calf in your area with greater 

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:57.830
 perimeter the person to measure should be 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.770
 sitting with the leg at an angle 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.020
 90 degree 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.390
 we already have the measurements and now what do I do 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.490
 with them then that is the next step 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.380
 to calculate the percentage of fat 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.810
 we just have to apply some simple 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.810
 formulas depending on our sex 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.590
 You can also isolate the weight of your 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.870
 body fat to know exactly 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.870
 how many kilos of fat your body has 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:27.589
 it's very simple you just have to 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:30.169
 compare your percentage of body fat 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:33.969
 with the data from these tables and you 'll know 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.969
 If your percentage of fat is adequate 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.129
 now that you already know is exactly that 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.439
 a fat percentage it 's time to act on 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:48.539
 consequence and take it to a few values 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:51.379
 within the normality in which you 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.379
 Health is not in danger
