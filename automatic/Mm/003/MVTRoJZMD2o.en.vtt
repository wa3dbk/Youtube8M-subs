00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
also has a bunch of amino acids as

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.490 
also has a bunch of amino acids as
l-arginine<00:01:00.420> l-glutamine<00:01:01.420> valine<00:01:02.289> leucine

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
l-arginine l-glutamine valine leucine

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.639 
l-arginine l-glutamine valine leucine
isoleucine<00:01:03.210> cysteine<00:01:04.210> lysine<00:01:05.110> they're

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
isoleucine cysteine lysine they're

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.179 
isoleucine cysteine lysine they're
running<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:07.030> has<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.210> viral<00:01:07.569> blend<00:01:08.009> it<00:01:09.009> has<00:01:09.159> a

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
running it has a viral blend it has a

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.940 
running it has a viral blend it has a
final<00:01:09.700> blend<00:01:09.939> and<00:01:10.719> as<00:01:10.840> an<00:01:10.990> enzyme<00:01:11.469> blend<00:01:11.829> as

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
final blend and as an enzyme blend as

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.300 
final blend and as an enzyme blend as
well<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:13.029> has<00:01:13.179> path<00:01:13.389> pain<00:01:13.659> bromelain<00:01:14.310> alpha

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
well so it has path pain bromelain alpha

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.199 
well so it has path pain bromelain alpha
amylase<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.119> lipase<00:01:16.209> and<00:01:16.719> it<00:01:17.590> also<00:01:17.709> has<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.310> bit

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209 
amylase and lipase and it also has a bit

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.899 
amylase and lipase and it also has a bit
a<00:01:19.240> few<00:01:19.389> extra<00:01:20.020> ingredients<00:01:20.799> are<00:01:21.039> it<00:01:21.369> also<00:01:21.579> has

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
a few extra ingredients are it also has

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.019 
a few extra ingredients are it also has
alpha<00:01:22.599> lipoic<00:01:22.779> acid<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.609> find<00:01:24.849> is<00:01:24.939> the

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
alpha lipoic acid which I find is the

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.359 
alpha lipoic acid which I find is the
most<00:01:25.240> important<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.799> everything<00:01:27.099> that<00:01:27.249> I

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
most important out of everything that I

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.279

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
don't know what alpha lipoic acid is a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.980 
don't know what alpha lipoic acid is a
very<00:01:32.259> very<00:01:32.649> very<00:01:33.130> important<00:01:33.759> antioxidant<00:01:34.509> one

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
very very very important antioxidant one

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.919 
very very very important antioxidant one

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
as much in most of other multivitamins

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.159 
as much in most of other multivitamins
but<00:01:42.039> you<00:01:42.099> get<00:01:42.249> 25<00:01:42.609> milligrams<00:01:43.090> here<00:01:43.299> so<00:01:43.929> I'll

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.169 
but you get 25 milligrams here so I'll

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:45.899 
but you get 25 milligrams here so I'll
phone<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.499> poet<00:01:44.799> acid<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:45.609> don't<00:01:45.789> already

know what that is research it google it
because<00:01:48.340> alpha<00:01:48.549> lipoic<00:01:48.759> acid<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.450> very

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
because alpha lipoic acid is very

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.359 
because alpha lipoic acid is very
important<00:01:50.049> for<00:01:50.139> bodybuilders<00:01:50.679> or<00:01:50.979> people<00:01:51.310> who
