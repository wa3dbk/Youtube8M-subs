00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.599
 Hello everyone guys with you and today 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.150
 I have a little bit for you 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.789
 unusual video in this video I will show 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.509
 you a secret card called 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.939
 border of the empire 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.680
 This is a Chinese map and many of you already 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.179
 could see about some sites sometime 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.189
 there half a year ago 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:30.339
 screenshots of this map screenshots minimap 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.850
 some screenshots from the area but at the same time 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:36.400
 u just recently i saw a video on the net with 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.110
 With this card I decided to show it to you in 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.360
 why the joke why is it somehow not 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.309
 us in the game on the server pv or 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.110
 European imitation server cases 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.379
 guys in that chinese server 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.210
 fenced off from everyone else the whole thing in 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.640
 that the Chinese government has supplied 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.219
 all in such a way that no company 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.840
 from any other party not Volyn 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.719
 blizzard his diary cannot directly 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.129
 working in china with users this 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.780
 everything must be done through an intermediary 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.730
 wargaming all this through 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.170
 broker name I will not say it but 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.330
 I will say that thanks to this and probably 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.970
 the mentality of the Chinese players is theirs 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.869
 the game is pretty hector nuanced strongly 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.750
 different from ours 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.119
 for example there is a unique tank type 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.099
 59 gold which has not only 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.319
 increased farm but also increased 

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:25.899
 the profitability of the battles there is such a 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.950
 map of the borders of empires that are not 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.140
 on other servers 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.090
 there are some tanks on sale 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.450
 which we have no sale for example 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.979
 square-5 usual type 59 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.479
 what else did we get out of the game there again 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.880
 same duck most likely left there 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.979
 sales and so on in general periodically 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.320
 information from this server leaks 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.090
 the internet but its completely his 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.900
 For example , recently the guys became 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.330
 it is known that there are these on sale 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.490
 tanks of level 10 that we have issued 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.770
 for winning the global map ie 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.210
 it turns out the Chinese players are playing on 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.400
 your server is stewed in its own juice 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.360
 they have their own nuances there that is there 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.479
 as you understand yourself 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.420
 special mentality despite all this 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.709
 tanks reached there as far as I know 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.709
 as far as I was told in very serious 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.080
 results and of course origen is trying 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.910
 to go to meet them such as children's 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.489
 the Chinese branch is exactly this 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.080
 information side 44 percent is 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.820
 exactly a step towards the Chinese players 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.430
 because the Chinese have been asking for a very long time 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.870
 imagine that your native tanks did not 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.350
 loved to ride Soviet and 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.260
 German 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.209
 from and the developers decided to go to the chicken 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.040
 access to them and because in fact I think 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.680
 you understand that the tanks but very similar 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.510
 to chinese to soviet prototypes well and 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.430
 one of the chips of the Chinese server has become 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.410
 This is the map I want today. 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.530
 I would like to show you something called 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.590
 lil a string of empire border it is available 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.120
 only on the Chinese server beats 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.920
 on its landscape this great one 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.140
 the chinese wall which is in age 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.610
 times defended if i'm not mistaken 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.709
 Chinese from invasion and 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.120
 tatar-mongolian yoke maybe i 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.410
 of course here you are mistaken in history 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.720
 carries therefore if something correct me 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.519
 Well, and today, let's own 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.900
 look at her across guys what 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.250
 I would like to note despite 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.170
 mixed landscape here as if 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.390
 present and the plains and mountains that is 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.360
 the closest thing I would say 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.530
 Pass maps and Karelia would like to 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.299
 note the size of the court of 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.760
 permissible world map poster and you 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.410
 You understand how it is a huge map 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.450
 was done and when thousands of old map 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.579
 deeds that is to her already about a year 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.620
 only now there is a video and I 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.140
 I want to say what is really what 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.280
 got on their servers absolutely not 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.080
 is compared 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.840
 what was done for our server because 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.760
 that the dimensions are really huge not 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.230
 I know it is good or bad because 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.170
 again we have tanks in the game 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.650
 which for example 800 meters is not enough 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.550
 eg 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.170
 it is 268 and wants 155 and if these tanks are for 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.670
 which a kilometer and a half it is 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.610
 very many or kilometers because 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.440
 it's t95 or mouse but again guys 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.690
 card sizes are just amazing sizes 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.660
 what is the variability that is you 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.520
 see for example on minimap what you need 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.680
 drive in from above you can drive in to the right 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.450
 there is and there is a village there are several 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.930
 passages that is, in principle, now we 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.900
 here are all the last well the face 811 yes there 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.220
 there will be a new good end all last 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.989
 cards that were entered this next 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.819
 patch not all were monotonous there was 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.370
 a maximum of 2 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.169
 well, a maximum of three directions is a map 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.030
 a fan on the contrary she seems to me a lot 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.040
 more variable because you can pass 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.450
 the glass can not be turned off Kalinin 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.160
 fourth line before you can go through 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.630
 zero there it is possible again here is shorter 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.470
 you want a lot of passes 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.660
 Here maybe of course someone will say that 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.210
 she is not interesting and that she is open to 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.890
 punch punches artillery but again 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.630
 than on the same erlenberg guys too 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.760
 artillery almost everywhere punches 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.310
 but at the same time we somehow so he once 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.590
 played up to the house forts if now this 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.740
 eerie standing art there actually 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.870
 nothing helps 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.479
 so I wouldn't say that 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.479
 a half-open card is there significant 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.300
 minus to it maybe just a reason to 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.550
 to move faster and something 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.110
 do want to take away principle card 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.400
 I liked it exactly 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.520
 that its dimensions allow something 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.830
 come up with of course more clearly something 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.630
 can not say the principle is just a guy 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.150
 here as it rolls something tells there 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.889
 in Chinese like those by the way here 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.419
 one more of and dimming client you 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.930
 see that there is some kind of running on top 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.509
 line 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.190
 I guess it is some there 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.009
 latest stock news by the way 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.900
 wonder why us with wargaming 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.880
 the way the region have not yet done so yah 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.120
 perhaps of course so that this would distract 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.909
 but again in the hangar it would be quite 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.280
 to the place though again from the other side 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.760
 possible to rob on erger cards 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.240
 elenberg 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.890
 a mosquito it would just be possible 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.020
 because there were such well you 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.910
 you yourself understand that 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.340
 As for the card, such a good card for 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.790
 mixed type there see a lot of stones 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.580
 there is where to hide there and ride yes she 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.040
 huge and if my memory serves me 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.720
 she in my opinion 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.100
 David probably more accurate memory and vision 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.220
 changing reach 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.750
 and therefore a kilometer and a half, so she strongly 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.080
 the house that is, if you leave it like this 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.110
 it is about half the percentage after 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.490
 50 more than I want to pass here it here 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.100
 me most honest ringtones from 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.510
 pass here if we compare impose 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.910
 minimap pass to minimap 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.980
 how the borders of the empire will turn back 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.600
 before empty 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.430
 print then more good bad 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.590
 Such a card means, but will not 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.060
 our server is generally on this guys 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.060
 I basically wanted to show you this 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.410
 the card wanted to tell you what is being taught 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.720
 cook on a chinese server there 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.950
 a little bit there small things if you 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.900
 liked the video subscribe to 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.270
 channel if you want to hear some 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.340
 more interesting details about 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.560
 there let's say other servers or 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.240
 some secret things appdata mutlu 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.950
 it happens that something in the game 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.090
 appears but let's say not on us 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.170
 server and there on the European and 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.750
 American or husband again to the risks 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:07.450
 more precisely as they call the Asian server 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.650
 here and in Chinese and write in general 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.200
 comments so you want to hear 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.510
