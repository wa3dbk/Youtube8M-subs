now this could change a little bit

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.130 
now this could change a little bit
depending<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:50.940> happens<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.989> B

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
there because I just wasn't really

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.020 
there because I just wasn't really
paying<00:01:31.979> attention<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.790> thought<00:01:32.850> he

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
paying attention and I just thought he

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
paying attention and I just thought he
was<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> corner<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.960> yeah<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.920> objective

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
was the corner but yeah so my objective

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.429 
was the corner but yeah so my objective
was<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> sentry<00:01:36.509> gun<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:37.200> would

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
was to get the sentry gun which would

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
was to get the sentry gun which would
allow<00:01:37.770> me<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.240> help<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.659> my

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
allow me to it would help me with my

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.569 
allow me to it would help me with my
third<00:01:39.990> goal<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.470> locking<00:01:40.860> down<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> side

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
third goal which was locking down a side

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.520 
third goal which was locking down a side
of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> math<00:01:41.970> cuz<00:01:42.210> aftermath<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> really

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
of the math cuz aftermath is a really

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
of the math cuz aftermath is a really
weird<00:01:43.710> map<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.430> tricky<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.000> has

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
weird map it's really tricky it has

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.740 
weird map it's really tricky it has
basically<00:01:45.600> three<00:01:46.049> lanes<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.270> oftentimes<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
basically three lanes and oftentimes a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.929 
basically three lanes and oftentimes a
team<00:01:49.020> doesn't<00:01:49.530> cover<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:49.920> three<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:50.729> for

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
team doesn't cover all three of them for

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.460 
team doesn't cover all three of them for
example<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.479> side<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.380> I'm

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
example this side right here that I'm

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.469 
example this side right here that I'm
working<00:01:53.040> over<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> noticed<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.000> my<00:01:54.210> team<00:01:54.450> has

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
working over I noticed that my team has

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.959 
working over I noticed that my team has
nobody<00:01:55.250> defending<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.369> direction<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
nobody defending this direction so I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.639 
nobody defending this direction so I
pick<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:57.689> real<00:01:57.990> quick<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.530> make

grenade to the right
the<00:02:13.620> truck<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.310> point<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.720> grenade

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
was specifically to blow up the truck if

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020 
was specifically to blow up the truck if
the<00:02:19.560> guy<00:02:19.680> decided<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.310> move<00:02:20.430> back<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.910> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the guy decided to move back and you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
the guy decided to move back and you
notice<00:02:21.300> i<00:02:21.420> moved<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.960> right<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.440> bus

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
notice i moved to the right of the bus

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.730 
notice i moved to the right of the bus
and<00:02:23.130> email<00:02:23.520> site<00:02:23.820> there<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.470> let's<00:02:25.470> take<00:02:25.590> one

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
and email site there and let's take one

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.170 
and email site there and let's take one
more<00:02:25.800> look<00:02:26.010> at<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.310> will<00:02:26.520> go<00:02:26.640> back<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.030> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
more look at that will go back to that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.020 
more look at that will go back to that
okay<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.860> reason<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.250> did<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.460> was

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
okay so the reason I did this was

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.180 
okay so the reason I did this was
because<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.870> guy<00:02:31.020> decided<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.650> backtrack

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
because if the guy decided to backtrack

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.940 
because if the guy decided to backtrack
and<00:02:32.460> go<00:02:32.640> towards<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.290> ambulance<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and go towards the ambulance then the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.470 
and go towards the ambulance then the
grenade<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.580> semtex<00:02:35.790> would<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.300> actually

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
grenade the semtex would have actually

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.390 
grenade the semtex would have actually
blown<00:02:36.990> up<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.470> ambulance<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.190> he<00:02:38.280> would

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
blown up that ambulance and he would

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.610 
blown up that ambulance and he would
have<00:02:38.490> died<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.570> aim<00:02:39.780> down<00:02:39.990> sight<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.440> other

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
have died but I aim down sight the other

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.340 
have died but I aim down sight the other
side<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.250> bus<00:02:41.460> because<00:02:41.990> this<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.320> only

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
side of the bus because this is the only

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.860 
side of the bus because this is the only
option<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:44.340> him<00:02:44.490> he<00:02:44.700> had<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.000> come<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.570> of

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
option for him he had to come out of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
option for him he had to come out of
that<00:02:46.200> side<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.220> bus<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.850> would<00:02:48.030> have

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
that side of the bus and I would have

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.700 
that side of the bus and I would have
been<00:02:48.240> perfectly<00:02:48.720> ready<00:02:48.990> for<00:02:49.260> him<00:02:49.350> aim<00:02:49.530> down

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
been perfectly ready for him aim down

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.200 
been perfectly ready for him aim down
sight<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.160> if<00:02:50.280> not<00:02:50.460> he<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.820> would<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.030> died

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
sight but if not he just would have died

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.730 
sight but if not he just would have died
from<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> grenadian<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.960> explosion<00:02:52.380> anyway

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
from the grenadian the explosion anyway

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.370 
from the grenadian the explosion anyway
so<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:53.160> was<00:02:53.250> pretty<00:02:53.460> much<00:02:53.640> perfectly

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
so that was pretty much perfectly

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.020 
so that was pretty much perfectly
formulated<00:02:55.380> some<00:02:55.590> text<00:02:55.950> which<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.370> mean<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.850> may

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
formulated some text which I mean it may

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.580 
formulated some text which I mean it may
not<00:02:57.180> seem<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:57.480> such<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> big<00:02:58.020> deal<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.440> it's

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
not seem like such a big deal but it's

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.290 
not seem like such a big deal but it's
just<00:02:58.740> little<00:02:58.950> things<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.670> can

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
just little things like that that can

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.090 
just little things like that that can
actually<00:03:00.720> cut<00:03:01.080> off<00:03:01.290> an<00:03:01.470> enemy<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.920> certain

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
actually cut off an enemy in a certain

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.280 
actually cut off an enemy in a certain
direction<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.630> make<00:03:03.750> things<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.110> lot

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
direction and can make things a lot

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.720 
direction and can make things a lot
easier<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:04.740> your<00:03:04.920> team<00:03:05.100> because<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.490> died

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
easier for your team because if I died

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.010 
easier for your team because if I died
here<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.420> Lane<00:03:06.630> would<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.900> been

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
here this Lane would have been

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.020 
here this Lane would have been
completely<00:03:07.200> open<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.130> completely

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
completely open and completely

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.840 
completely open and completely
undefended<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:10.020> my<00:03:10.380> job<00:03:10.650> right<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.730> to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
undefended so my job right here was to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.640 
undefended so my job right here was to
stay<00:03:12.060> alive<00:03:12.360> as<00:03:12.600> much<00:03:12.840> as<00:03:13.020> possible<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.590> we

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
stay alive as much as possible now we

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.220 
stay alive as much as possible now we
see<00:03:13.860> little<00:03:14.040> random<00:03:14.550> random<00:03:15.210> unicorn<00:03:15.720> guy<00:03:15.900> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
see little random random unicorn guy I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.750 
see little random random unicorn guy I
don't<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:16.890> why<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.070> called<00:03:17.340> him<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.580> but<00:03:17.700> he

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
don't know why I called him that but he

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.220 
don't know why I called him that but he
could<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> part<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.390> unicorn<00:03:18.750> squadron

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
could be a part of the unicorn squadron

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.320 
could be a part of the unicorn squadron
because<00:03:19.470> he<00:03:19.560> died<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.060> obviously<00:03:21.060> wasn't

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
because he died and obviously wasn't

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.640 
because he died and obviously wasn't
gonna<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:21.660> much<00:03:21.840> help<00:03:21.870> if<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.290> didn't<00:03:22.500> stay

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
gonna be much help if I didn't stay

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.229 
gonna be much help if I didn't stay
alive<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.700> said<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.060> Lane

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
alive and that like I said that Lane

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.550 
alive and that like I said that Lane
would<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.510> been<00:03:24.600> completely<00:03:24.750> open<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.440> it's

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
would have been completely open so it's

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.810 
would have been completely open so it's
really<00:03:25.709> really<00:03:26.040> good<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> stayed<00:03:26.580> alive

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
really really good that I stayed alive

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.970 
really really good that I stayed alive
there<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:27.270> I<00:03:27.510> got<00:03:28.170> my<00:03:28.290> streaks<00:03:28.590> will<00:03:28.739> fast

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
there now I got my streaks will fast

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.620 
there now I got my streaks will fast
forward<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.280> little<00:03:29.459> bit<00:03:29.550> further<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.600> game

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
forward a little bit further in the game

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.420 
forward a little bit further in the game
to<00:03:31.020> actually<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.530> beginning<00:03:31.770> of<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.070> second

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
to actually the beginning of the second

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.250 
to actually the beginning of the second
round<00:03:32.520> which<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.000> another<00:03:33.300> place<00:03:34.020> where<00:03:34.050> I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
round which is another place where I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.250 
round which is another place where I
think<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.530> played<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.220> little<00:03:35.550> bit

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
think I played this in a little bit

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.330 
think I played this in a little bit
strategic<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.440> there's<00:03:37.800> another<00:03:38.010> cool

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
strategic and there's another cool

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.610 
strategic and there's another cool
grenade<00:03:38.670> right<00:03:38.700> there<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:40.080> one's<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.410> little

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
grenade right there that one's a little

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.110 
grenade right there that one's a little
bit<00:03:40.830> more<00:03:41.070> on<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.190> lucky<00:03:41.430> side<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.940> come

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
bit more on the lucky side but I come

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.490 
bit more on the lucky side but I come
over<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.570> beef<00:03:42.720> leg<00:03:42.959> because<00:03:43.230> unlike

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
over to the beef leg because unlike

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.890 
over to the beef leg because unlike
before<00:03:43.680> my<00:03:44.370> team<00:03:44.670> wasn't<00:03:44.910> doing<00:03:45.330> as<00:03:45.480> good<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.750> a

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
before my team wasn't doing as good of a

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.600 
before my team wasn't doing as good of a
job<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.410> actually<00:03:46.650> getting<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:47.430> now<00:03:47.580> that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
job of actually getting it but now that

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.640 
job of actually getting it but now that
I<00:03:47.760> kind<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.090> played<00:03:48.239> paved<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.720> way<00:03:48.810> for<00:03:49.140> them

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
I kind of played paved the way for them

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.560 
I kind of played paved the way for them
they<00:03:49.830> were<00:03:49.920> actually<00:03:50.130> able<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.700> come<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.030> to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
they were actually able to come and to

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.270 
they were actually able to come and to
capture<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.080> so<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> was<00:03:52.680> really<00:03:52.800> happy<00:03:53.130> about

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
capture it so I was really happy about

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.740 
capture it so I was really happy about
that<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.670> was<00:03:53.760> able<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.060> come<00:03:54.269> over<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.630> this

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
that and I was able to come over to this

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.380 
that and I was able to come over to this
side<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.200> do<00:03:55.350> kind<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.709> what<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:55.860> did<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
side and do kind of what I did on the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.509 
side and do kind of what I did on the
little<00:03:57.630> under<00:03:57.959> bridge<00:03:58.200> by<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.440> bus<00:03:58.769> before<00:03:59.010> on

the first round I was able to kind of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.440 
the first round I was able to kind of
defend<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.830> completely<00:04:02.459> undefended<00:04:02.880> area

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
locking down the areas that my team

don't have already covered and I picked

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.659 
don't have already covered and I picked
up<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.470> shotgun<00:04:19.890> which<00:04:20.070> was<00:04:20.220> kind<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.489> lucky

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
up a shotgun which was kind of lucky

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.969 
up a shotgun which was kind of lucky
because<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.150> actually<00:04:21.570> was<00:04:22.260> very<00:04:22.500> useful<00:04:22.890> in

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
because it actually was very useful in

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.100 
because it actually was very useful in
this<00:04:23.100> area<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.390> want<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.720> pick<00:04:24.900> off<00:04:25.080> a
