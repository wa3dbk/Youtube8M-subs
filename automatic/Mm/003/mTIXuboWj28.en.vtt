video and Zuki just recently sent me

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.500 
video and Zuki just recently sent me
these<00:00:06.270> STL<00:00:07.049> files<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:08.340> his<00:00:08.580> 3d<00:00:09.120> printed

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
these STL files for his 3d printed

right<00:00:12.599> here<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.009> showcased<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.670> previous

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
right here I showcased it in a previous

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
right here I showcased it in a previous
video<00:00:15.350> look<00:00:16.350> he<00:00:16.500> had<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.800> connected<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.460> his

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
video look he had it connected to his

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.150 
video look he had it connected to his
guy's<00:00:17.880> own<00:00:18.119> goggles<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.890> wanted

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
to do is just show this print in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.230

assembled version so before our print

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
assembled version so before our print
let<00:00:46.620> me<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.920> point<00:00:47.100> out<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.180> piece<00:00:48.450> right

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
let me just point out this piece right

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.529 
let me just point out this piece right
here<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.110> actually<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.800> template<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.239> coil

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
here is actually a template it's a coil

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.389 
here is actually a template it's a coil
template<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.469> antenna<00:00:52.860> wire<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.280> can

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
template for your antenna wire you can

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
template for your antenna wire you can
see<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> goes<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.480> you'll<00:00:55.289> get

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
see it goes in here and then you'll get

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
see it goes in here and then you'll get
to<00:00:55.620> coil<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.670> template<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> cool

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to coil on so this template is cool

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
to coil on so this template is cool
because<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.260> keep<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> around<00:00:58.770> after<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
because you can keep it around after you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.939 
because you can keep it around after you
print<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.969> use<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.199> build<00:01:01.620> other

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
print it and use it to build other

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
print it and use it to build other
antennas<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.820> let<00:01:02.940> me<00:01:03.030> go<00:01:03.149> ahead<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.420> get<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
antennas so let me go ahead and get this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.140 
antennas so let me go ahead and get this
ready<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.799> Ziggy<00:01:05.489> suggested

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
ready now one thing that Ziggy suggested

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
ready now one thing that Ziggy suggested
is<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.290> working<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.710> PLA<00:01:08.369> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
is because we will be working with PLA I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.840 
is because we will be working with PLA I
print<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> replicator<00:01:10.229> 2<00:01:10.560> he<00:01:11.280> prints<00:01:11.700> with

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
print with a replicator 2 he prints with

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.320 
print with a replicator 2 he prints with
a<00:01:11.880> 2<00:01:12.180> X<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> use<00:01:13.080> PLA<00:01:13.619> his<00:01:14.520> suggestion<00:01:15.180> was

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
a 2 X so I use PLA his suggestion was

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.620 
a 2 X so I use PLA his suggestion was
for<00:01:15.600> me<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.900> ahead<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> scale<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.830> up

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.810 
for me to go ahead and scale this up
0.5%<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> change<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> 0.5

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
0.5% so I'm going to change that to 0.5

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
0.5% so I'm going to change that to 0.5
hit<00:01:23.820> enter<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:24.720> these<00:01:24.930> things<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.290> scaled

slicing<00:01:50.880> everything<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.659> it'll<00:01:52.020> save<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
slicing everything up it'll save it and

slicing everything up it'll save it and
then<00:01:53.250> we'll<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.610> able<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> print<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.540> we

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
then we'll be able to print it here we

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.940 
then we'll be able to print it here we
got<00:01:54.780> everything<00:01:54.990> exported<00:01:55.710> we're<00:01:55.829> gonna

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
got everything exported we're gonna

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.389

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 

okay<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.569> everything<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.230> printed<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:16.739> this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
a majority of the print time happens so
