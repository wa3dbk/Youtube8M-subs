00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
back into Windows I'll just check my

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:29.220 
back into Windows I'll just check my
hard<00:03:20.740> drives<00:03:26.220> okay<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.570> now<00:03:28.750> we're<00:03:28.930> going<00:03:29.110> to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
hard drives okay so now we're going to

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.300 
hard drives okay so now we're going to
use<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.910> small<00:03:30.910> tool<00:03:31.210> called<00:03:31.810> easy<00:03:32.200> BCD<00:03:33.130> and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
use a small tool called easy BCD and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.950 
use a small tool called easy BCD and
that<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.120> going<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.330> rebuild<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.990> MBR<00:03:35.350> photos

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
that is going to rebuild the MBR photos

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.670 
that is going to rebuild the MBR photos
just<00:03:37.960> Google<00:03:38.500> easy<00:03:38.800> BCD<00:03:40.410> there's<00:03:41.410> only<00:03:41.560> a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
just Google easy BCD there's only a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.090 
just Google easy BCD there's only a
small<00:03:41.800> application<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:45.100> we're<00:03:45.760> going<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.180> use

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
small application and we're going to use

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.990 
small application and we're going to use
