instead of using my iPhone 4 with its
dodgy<00:00:14.879> camera<00:00:15.209> so<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> want<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> talk<00:00:16.800> to

dodgy camera so what I want to talk to
you<00:00:16.950> about<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.160> time<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.030> lowepro<00:00:18.510> back

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
you about this time is the lowepro back

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.650 
you about this time is the lowepro back
camera<00:00:20.039> back<00:00:20.160> pack<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.179> it's<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
camera back pack that you have it's the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.550 
camera back pack that you have it's the
fast<00:00:22.140> pack<00:00:22.470> 250<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.330> 250<00:00:24.840> aw<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
fast pack 250 not the 250 aw which is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.230 
fast pack 250 not the 250 aw which is
the<00:00:25.650> model<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:25.949> replaced<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.880> model

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the model that replaced this model

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.099 
the model that replaced this model
recently<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.589> regular<00:00:29.009> fast<00:00:29.310> pack<00:00:29.519> 250

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
recently but the regular fast pack 250

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.800 
recently but the regular fast pack 250
so<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:31.890> thing<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.880> say<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
so the first thing to say is that I

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.970 
so the first thing to say is that I
think<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> understand<00:00:34.800> why<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:37.410> backpack<00:00:37.860> has

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
think I understand why this backpack has

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.799 
think I understand why this backpack has
been<00:00:38.100> replaced<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.640> new<00:00:38.820> model<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.539> has

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
been replaced with a new model it has

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
been replaced with a new model it has
some<00:00:40.410> shortcomings<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.879> most<00:00:42.059> dramatic

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
some shortcomings and the most dramatic

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
some shortcomings and the most dramatic
of<00:00:42.629> which<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.289> that<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.860> doesn't<00:00:44.039> have<00:00:44.219> support

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
of which is that it doesn't have support

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.180 
of which is that it doesn't have support
for<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> tripod<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:46.559> although<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> probably

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
for a tripod and although you probably

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.619 
for a tripod and although you probably
notice<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> tripod<00:00:48.030> hanging<00:00:48.329> off<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> side

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
notice is a tripod hanging off the side

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.510 
notice is a tripod hanging off the side
of<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:49.020> bag<00:00:49.199> here<00:00:49.500> has<00:00:50.309> been<00:00:50.570> right<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:52.520> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
of my bag here has been right here so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
of my bag here has been right here so
that<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.180> done<00:00:54.390> through<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:55.079> ingenuity<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that was done through some ingenuity I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.420 
that was done through some ingenuity I
discovered<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.670> YouTube<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.710> use<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
discovered on YouTube and the use of a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.900 
discovered on YouTube and the use of a
cheap<00:00:59.879> bungee<00:01:00.390> cord<00:01:00.600> which<00:01:00.780> cost<00:01:01.019> me<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.379> euro

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
cheap bungee cord which cost me one euro

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.960 
cheap bungee cord which cost me one euro
so<00:01:02.910> basically<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.570> bank<00:01:03.750> does<00:01:04.199> come<00:01:04.670> with<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
so basically the bank does come with a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.530 
so basically the bank does come with a
water<00:01:06.420> bottle<00:01:06.600> holder<00:01:06.990> down<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> what

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
water bottle holder down here so what

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.520 
water bottle holder down here so what
you<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:14.030> start<00:01:15.030> off<00:01:15.180> by<00:01:15.540> taking<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you do is you start off by taking the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.999 
you do is you start off by taking the
tripod<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:16.979> opening<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.860> sticking<00:01:19.860> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
tripod and opening it up and sticking in

it and you stick it underneath one leg
of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> tripod<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:42.020> I'm<00:01:43.020> doing<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> wrong

you stick it underneath one leg of the
tripod<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.200> then<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> bring<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> around

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.880 
tripod like so then you bring it around
it's<00:01:53.610> very<00:01:53.790> important<00:01:54.210> let<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.630> underneath

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.260 

the<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.460> back<00:01:59.670> straps

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
the two back straps

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
and then you go around and hook it on to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.540 
and then you go around and hook it on to
the<00:02:10.119> other<00:02:10.239> side<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.569> handle<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.220> have

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
the other side of the handle so you have

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.660 
the other side of the handle so you have
a<00:02:13.500> hook<00:02:14.500> hook<00:02:15.330> ran<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.540> tripod<00:02:17.670> underneath

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
a hook hook ran the tripod underneath

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.110 
a hook hook ran the tripod underneath
the<00:02:19.060> legs<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.720> then<00:02:20.530> underneath<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.849> drops

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
the legs and then underneath this drops

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.400 
the legs and then underneath this drops
at<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.360> back<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:23.200> then<00:02:23.790> put<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:24.970> leg<00:02:25.410> down

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
at the back and then put this leg down

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.190 
at the back and then put this leg down
in<00:02:27.190> there<00:02:27.430> too<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.349> tighten<00:02:29.349> that<00:02:29.379> up<00:02:30.989> okay

in there too and tighten that up okay
so<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.940> now<00:02:34.530> let's<00:02:35.530> take<00:02:35.799> off<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.130> tripod

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
when I take the camera for just a moment

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.590 
when I take the camera for just a moment
so<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.580> really<00:05:13.639> get<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:13.940> camera<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.300> sit

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.810 
safely and comfortably I've basically
added<00:05:16.789> three<00:05:17.419> blocks<00:05:18.260> of<00:05:18.500> padding<00:05:18.860> so<00:05:19.520> one<00:05:19.729> at

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
added three blocks of padding so one at

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.150 
added three blocks of padding so one at
the<00:05:19.880> bottom<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:21.169> one<00:05:21.320> at<00:05:21.350> each<00:05:21.560> side<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:22.070> the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
here without rattling around without

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.790 
here without rattling around without
that<00:05:28.639> padding<00:05:29.020> utterly<00:05:30.020> unworkable<00:05:30.590> for<00:05:30.770> a

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800
