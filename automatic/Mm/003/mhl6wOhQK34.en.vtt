00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
in the order that people posted them in

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.590 
in the order that people posted them in
which<00:00:37.890> means<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> first<00:00:39.000> question<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
which means that the first question is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.590 
which means that the first question is
do<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> shower<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.190> my<00:00:41.340> back<00:00:41.850> facing<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
do I shower with my back facing the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900 
do I shower with my back facing the
water<00:00:42.750> or<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.110> front<00:00:43.440> facing<00:00:43.770> water<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.219> shower

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
water or my front facing water I shower

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
water or my front facing water I shower
with<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:45.690> back<00:00:45.930> facing<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> water<00:00:46.620> but

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
with my back facing the water but

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.450 
with my back facing the water but
sometimes<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.000> turn<00:00:48.120> around<00:00:49.370> for<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sometimes I turn around for the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510 
sometimes I turn around for the
convenience<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.600> guess<00:00:52.440> okay<00:00:53.190> here's<00:00:53.399> an

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
convenience I guess okay here's an

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.959 
convenience I guess okay here's an
interesting<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.079> what<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.129> evolutionary

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
interesting one what is the evolutionary

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.319 
interesting one what is the evolutionary
advantage<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.840> pubic<00:00:58.320> hair<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:59.180> gonna<00:01:00.180> have

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
advantage of pubic hair I'm gonna have

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.960 
advantage of pubic hair I'm gonna have
to<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.320> while

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.480 

okay<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.260> evolutionary<00:01:08.040> advantage

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
okay I think the evolutionary advantage

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.120 
okay I think the evolutionary advantage
of<00:01:08.640> pubic<00:01:08.939> hair<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.619> I'll<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of pubic hair is I'll think of it this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.899 
of pubic hair is I'll think of it this
way<00:01:11.299> most<00:01:12.299> plans<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.049> our<00:01:13.080> body<00:01:13.909> disgusting

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
way most plans on our body disgusting

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.810 
way most plans on our body disgusting
places

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
places

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.649 
places
they<00:01:17.390> have<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.540> lot<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.750> hair<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.170> mean<00:01:18.350> okay

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
they have a lot of hair I mean okay

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.330 
they have a lot of hair I mean okay
think<00:01:20.659> certain<00:01:20.960> places<00:01:21.200> on<00:01:21.409> our<00:01:21.470> body<00:01:21.740> you

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
think certain places on our body you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.399 
think certain places on our body you
know<00:01:22.490> what<00:01:22.760> I'm<00:01:23.030> not<00:01:23.479> really<00:01:23.840> having<00:01:24.050> much

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
know what I'm not really having much

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.650 
know what I'm not really having much
luck<00:01:24.440> with<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.010> question<00:01:25.370> so<00:01:25.550> huh<00:01:25.880> you

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
luck with this question so huh you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.240 
luck with this question so huh you
should<00:01:26.810> probably<00:01:26.870> just<00:01:27.170> google<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.979> next

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
should probably just google it the next

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.940 
should probably just google it the next
question<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.760> if<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.869> try<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.200> fail<00:01:30.410> and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
question is if you try to fail and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.250 
question is if you try to fail and
succeed<00:01:30.979> in<00:01:31.460> failing<00:01:32.000> do<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:32.630> fail<00:01:32.990> or

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
succeed in failing do you fail or

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.830 
succeed in failing do you fail or
succeed<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:34.160> think<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.119> only<00:01:35.150> answer<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.690> that

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
succeed I think the only answer to that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.590 
succeed I think the only answer to that
question<00:01:36.080> is<00:01:36.759> life<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.290> road<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.600> best

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
question is life is a road and best

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.420 
question is life is a road and best
place<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:42.050> be<00:01:42.290> in<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:42.590> road<00:01:43.090> waitin

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
place to be in that road waitin

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.530 
place to be in that road waitin
