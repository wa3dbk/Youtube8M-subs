 bush sun santa house we are here from 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.350
 back to another gta5 video online and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.110
 We're not even here for another race. 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.610
 very crazy call it there in the branches 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.830
 freeway 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.929
 I do not know how this race just came out 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.970
 which have so simple ramps and insane 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.480
 How much I'm here with four young men 4 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 crazy 42 and let's go with our 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.430
 yes beautiful surroundings is the sealed environments 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 in beautiful have to always go personal in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.510
 when when ramps are very much in rooms 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.489
 always have to be beautiful surroundings 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.040
 when they are fast that are rehearsed more 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.200
 that they are complicated to pass because it is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.410
 Lupi many things like that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.140
 when they are very busy. 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.309
 way too much way too much 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 long and etc. 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.000
 also because we do not have 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 nothing for almost anything I only use to see 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.730
 When I'm wrong, choosing is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 truth 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.460
 unfortunately it 's if we just go there then 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 start our race here and let's go 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 I personally chose the settings in beautiful 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.830
 another lord chose the returns on 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
 beautiful others than the item 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.049
 and the other chose another in thee and I 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.119
 I think only races gta already know two 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.210
 turns let's see how it is 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.509

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.640
 We're third, everything is not going well. 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.560

 we spend beautiful calm with calminha 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.730

 the ball only in another time exactly 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.470
 when passing the point has to be reached 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:22.060

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.180

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.409
 It was just a lot of fun series to race. 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:29.089
 was pretending to race very physically 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.289
