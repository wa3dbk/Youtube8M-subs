trick to the smoky eye is all about

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.569 
trick to the smoky eye is all about
their<00:01:51.299> gradation<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.170> colors<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.430> always

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
their gradation of colors so it's always

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
their gradation of colors so it's always
going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.939> darkest<00:01:54.540> along<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.049> lashes

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.539 
going to be darkest along your lashes
and<00:01:55.950> then<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> fade<00:01:57.450> into<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
and then it's just going to fade into a

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.039 
and then it's just going to fade into a
little<00:01:59.549> bit<00:01:59.700> lighter<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.270> lightest<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> then

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
little bit lighter the lightest and then
