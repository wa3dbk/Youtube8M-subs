that's gonna be kind of a bummer it's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.850 
that's gonna be kind of a bummer it's
gonna<00:02:38.590> be<00:02:38.740> stuck<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.340> know<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.000> slick<00:02:40.270> wraps

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860

on back on but I just thought these ones

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.790 
on back on but I just thought these ones
are<00:02:46.510> cooler<00:02:46.720> because<00:02:46.990> this<00:02:47.290> look<00:02:47.440> wraps<00:02:47.650> on

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
are cooler because this look wraps on

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.940 
are cooler because this look wraps on
that<00:02:47.950> very<00:02:48.100> cool<00:02:48.310> colors<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.590> price<00:02:50.770> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.110 
better just like how you hold it and
sometimes<00:03:53.890> my<00:03:54.220> hand<00:03:54.430> falls<00:03:54.670> asleep<00:03:54.790> when<00:03:55.090> I

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
sometimes my hand falls asleep when I

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.660 
sometimes my hand falls asleep when I
play<00:03:55.360> for<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:56.050> while<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:56.890> does<00:03:57.100> fix<00:03:57.400> that

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
play for a while and that does fix that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.440 
play for a while and that does fix that
but<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:59.080> usually<00:03:59.680> have<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.280> off<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.790> unless<00:04:01.270> I'm

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
but I usually have it off and unless I'm

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.530 
but I usually have it off and unless I'm
doing<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:02.050> lot<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.560> gaming<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:03.280> just<00:04:04.180> don't<00:04:04.360> put

doing a lot of gaming I just don't put
them<00:04:04.660> on<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.560> again<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.910> might<00:04:07.060> want<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.270> get<00:04:07.390> a

are<00:04:40.090> pretty<00:04:40.330> good<00:04:40.420> feeling<00:04:41.350> but<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.040> triggers

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490
