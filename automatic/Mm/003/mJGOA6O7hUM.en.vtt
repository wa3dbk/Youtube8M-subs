00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
really did help with getting my hair a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.370 
really did help with getting my hair a
little<00:02:19.440> bit<00:02:19.590> more<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:21.000> goofing<00:02:21.690> making<00:02:22.290> it

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
little bit more like goofing making it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.500 
little bit more like goofing making it
look<00:02:22.410> thicker<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> was<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.390> little

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
look thicker and so I was a little

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.600 
look thicker and so I was a little
curious<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:26.160> not<00:02:26.250> be

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
curious about this because it's not be

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.970 
curious about this because it's not be
lodged<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.420> noon<00:02:27.690> I'm<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.860> was

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
lodged it's noon I'm you know it was

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.400 
lodged it's noon I'm you know it was
like<00:02:29.340> fourteen<00:02:29.819> dollars<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.630> didn't<00:02:31.230> want

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
like fourteen dollars so I didn't want

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.949 
like fourteen dollars so I didn't want
to<00:02:31.530> waste<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:31.860> money<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.000> thought<00:02:33.390> about<00:02:33.690> it

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
to waste my money but I thought about it

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.750 
to waste my money but I thought about it
and<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.290> thought<00:02:34.440> about<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.190> decided<00:02:35.550> you

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and I thought about it and I decided you

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.930 
and I thought about it and I decided you
know<00:02:35.970> why<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.230> may<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.620> well<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
know why not I may as well I like the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.059 
know why not I may as well I like the
other<00:02:39.120> matrix<00:02:39.750> product<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.860> probably

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
other matrix product so it's probably

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.390 
other matrix product so it's probably
going<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.489> good<00:02:41.730> product<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.239> well<00:02:42.300> and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
going to be a good product as well and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.720

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
problem that would really really

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
hair a more fuller look this is going to

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.010 
hair a more fuller look this is going to
be<00:05:30.930> something<00:05:31.140> that<00:05:31.400> really<00:05:32.900> comes<00:05:33.900> through

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
be something that really comes through

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.890 
be something that really comes through
for<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:35.760> don't<00:05:36.000> use<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.390> conditioner

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
for you and I don't use the conditioner

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.420 
for you and I don't use the conditioner
because<00:05:37.110> I<00:05:37.380> use<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.590> different<00:05:38.070> leave-in

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
because I use a different leave-in

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.840 
because I use a different leave-in
conditioner<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.180> find<00:05:39.720> that<00:05:39.960> if<00:05:40.110> I<00:05:40.230> use<00:05:40.669> just<00:05:41.669> a

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
conditioner I find that if I use just a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.120 
conditioner I find that if I use just a
regular<00:05:42.180> plain<00:05:42.720> ol<00:05:42.930> in<00:05:43.200> shower<00:05:43.470> conditioner

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
regular plain ol in shower conditioner

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.730 
regular plain ol in shower conditioner
my<00:05:44.340> hair<00:05:44.610> seems<00:05:45.419> like<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:45.750> gets<00:05:45.780> way<00:05:46.380> down

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
my hair seems like it gets way down

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.590 
my hair seems like it gets way down
which<00:05:47.160> I<00:05:47.340> haven't<00:05:47.730> tried<00:05:47.820> this<00:05:48.060> one<00:05:48.300> so

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
which I haven't tried this one so

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.450 
which I haven't tried this one so
because<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.290> shampoo<00:05:49.650> is<00:05:49.800> so<00:05:49.919> good<00:05:50.130> the

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
because the shampoo is so good the

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.370 
because the shampoo is so good the
conditioner<00:05:51.150> might<00:05:51.360> be<00:05:51.510> good<00:05:51.660> as<00:05:51.840> well<00:05:51.870> but

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
conditioner might be good as well but

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.220 
conditioner might be good as well but
I'm<00:05:52.590> kind<00:05:53.130> of<00:05:53.160> sticking<00:05:53.430> to<00:05:53.790> my<00:05:54.120> usual<00:05:54.900> routine
