 regular in Brazil 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.210

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.070
 How many guns are in regular status in Brazil? 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.899
 March from now 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.000
 thousands of post offices are poorly planned to register 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.170
 to make or renew the firearm record 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.179
 in one of the 6 thousand and 100 post offices it is necessary to take only a copy 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.489
 of the personal documents and the weapon data as the serial number hummingbird 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.009
 expressive brand impresses the ball and neither can because as a target a fine 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.740
 is infringing the law, the information will be sent to the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 federal police 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.439
 the issuance of the definitive registration 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.399
 the owner will be diverted by letter from the arrival of the document that should be 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.399
 done wrong at the same post office the service will cost 6 reais and 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.359
 fifty cents since the approval of the disarmament statute in 2003 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:35.119
 one million weapons were registered and another 500,000 were delivered to 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.009
 from January 1, the person who has a firearm without registration 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.709
 at home can no longer regularize the situation 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.180
 in which case the only option will be to deliver 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.310
 the weapon to the federal police in exchange for an indemnity of up to 300 reais who 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.230
 insisting on remaining with the gun without registration is committing the crime of 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.020
 illegal possession and can take four to six years in prison is not 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.170
 it is impossible for a citizen of a victim 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.230
 I call the police to see your house to deal with an occurrence of victims 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.459
 is faced with a weapon 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.909
 and it does not have the record of victims it will be treated as victims and 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.199
 shortly thereafter 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.669
 which would answer for a possible wave of elano
