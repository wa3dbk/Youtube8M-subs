00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
today that so many photographers don't

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.450 
today that so many photographers don't
realize<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.290> think<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> reason<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.340> don't

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
realize and I think the reason we don't

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.759 
realize and I think the reason we don't
realize<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:13.080> think<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
realize it is that we think that the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
realize it is that we think that the
f-stops<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.460> shutter<00:00:14.700> speeds<00:00:15.089> the

f-stops the shutter speeds the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.990 
f-stops the shutter speeds the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
megapixels the depth of field the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.120 
megapixels the depth of field the
composition<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.960> color<00:00:19.199> harmony<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:19.920> think

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
composition the color harmony we think

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.859 
composition the color harmony we think
those<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.580> most<00:00:20.760> important<00:00:21.270> aspects<00:00:21.720> of
