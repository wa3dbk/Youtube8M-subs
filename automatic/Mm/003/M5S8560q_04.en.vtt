00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.949
 here with the width that we carry 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.119
 it will not be enough for what is ours that comes 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.339
 then we will continue making increment 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.579
 As we have already mounted the stitch 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.809
 we passed the first point and in the next point the fact ali we will tell 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.800
 it is an additional point and I understand to affect this chain 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.749
 who could have won any montevideo 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.229
 We were going to weave 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.740
 a right point 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.660
 whether or not you want it this way 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 they measure again 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.170
 so they can not appreciate better 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.090
 the point under there they took opined 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.710
 we highlight the point 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.870
 and in the same point 5 in charge 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.270
 we assemble the next point 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.870
 this round let's go 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.020
 to tiger what is inimputable 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.360
 let's weave something sharp we go to the neighbor above 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.540
 that we were going to weave 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.820
 and we continue with the same story 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.970
 quintana carballo must be protected 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.300
 another right 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.030
 because here we are going to double the points 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.420
 We are going to weave two ends at each point so we take it close and look at it this way 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.190
 let's set a point 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.650
 maybe for the blind spot another point to right 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.580
 the girona is something very nice the animated doodle we take weaving a point 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.260
 cane 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.500
 and it has another point 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.190
 in this way we are going to double the points we left in total 28 points what 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.469
 it will be the ranch 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.950
 I have to swallow the sea 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.260
 here we will continue until we finish the round here we are reaching the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.770
 end of the turn 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.080
 and they're going to remember that the last point ctg norman 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.999
 from here 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.790

 26 points 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.869
 everything I do 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.340
 piquetera finally piquetera while the Italian 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.730
 now he has 36 points 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.730
 let's assemble what is the point again 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.020
 taking out the first point 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.339
 and with the prd 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.559
 let's weave a right 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.959
 and the next point will be a setback 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.029
 after 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.129
 straight 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.159
 and the next one a reverse 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.109
 everything is dead we are not going to weave with a right and a brief 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.169
 they begin to knit stitches that is a right 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 and they wanted to perform 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.330
 has claimed that the pp 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.930
 all the turns because always to knit and knit 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.479
 that the English tip 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.769
 the first round is scoring has done against him and in the second round of 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.799
 When we began to assemble the point taking the spotlight 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.629
 Now here we are going to appreciate the English tip 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.529
 in all the laps 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:08.819
 Until remaining 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.069
 long because we need to knit another one of sand 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.679
 remember the first point of right and weave point down 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.319
 the 17 points revert normal 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.710
 the one that has the point of the arch 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.710
 with all this 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.779
 and the one that follows green dot 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.779
 world warnings point was not low 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.109
 the cultural identity 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.889
 here we are going to knit 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.769
 all the return 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.879
 who continue to arrive 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.189
 by his side 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.189
 29 centimeters 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.249
 here is how to do it having 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.579
 this is what we have here and I want you to appreciate and see that a 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.369
 third pointed 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:02.519
 was about to die to die has not yet fulfilled and what we have left of the 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.429
 50 grams 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.689
 then we come to the end 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.359
 with the 29 centimeters now let's do here we did increase 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.230
 on the other side now let's make it decreases 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.449
 to get to the same have about 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.960
 this is the length of 29 centimeters 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.220
 from where we no longer start making increments from there we go 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.220
 to count the length of 29 centimeters 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 let's continue here let's pass the first point 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.710
 and now let's take two points commented 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.830
 to attack with a point of fact 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.469
 because we are going to do the decrease is here 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.469
 let's decrease 2 percent 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.669
 here now we will make a point 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.669
 is decreasing two points together 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.199
 the next one we will take again 2% but we will abide by a right point 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.719
 A) Yes 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.719
 all these points 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.169
 to get them out with a key point 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.310
 here we are going to decrease so that there are not half of the points 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.699
 we take two points 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.699
 we take points 3 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:29.800
 and we take the following two points by weaving two sets of network 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.849
 so until the end of the round we had a point that we took it out 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.529
 straight 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.610
 that's how you see our first 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.770
 back where we are doing the decreases 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.199
 we turn our fabric 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.650
 and we will continue here 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.360
 let's pass the first point 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.949
 tried to do it 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.949
 well that's how it should be 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.580
 I was operated on almost half of the points 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.389
 we take the first story 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.180
 and this customer point we're going to knit 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.180
 English unpunctual let's take the point below 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.919
 i the next point of the global 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.919
 the next we took a point down 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.960
 hastings 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.960
 we get a point from the fact 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:25.849
 a reverse point 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.849
 the next point we take again the god bacchus 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.749
 next to ramírez 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:35.749
 and here until finishing the round 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.499
 this point that the English tip 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:41.900
 right point 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.900
 and the last thing we have left to do is aim for kings 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.909
 sorry the last one we have left pointed to right
