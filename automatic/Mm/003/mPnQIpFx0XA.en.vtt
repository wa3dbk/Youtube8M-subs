right and what I want to show you here
quickly<00:00:37.880> is<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.710> relationship<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.920> cam

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
quickly is the relationship of the cam

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.040 
quickly is the relationship of the cam
belt<00:00:40.370> tensioner<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.090> parts<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:41.870> you

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
belt tensioner and the parts that you

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.120 
belt tensioner and the parts that you
should<00:00:42.260> be<00:00:42.380> aware<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.710> when<00:00:42.950> you're<00:00:43.100> doing

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
should be aware of when you're doing

together around the obviously the most

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.009 
together around the obviously the most
important<00:00:51.230> thing<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:51.859> the<00:00:52.579> crank<00:00:53.120> shaft<00:00:53.210> now

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
important thing is the crank shaft now

this particular one being 10 years I've
been<00:01:23.450> doing<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.750> lot<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:23.990> work<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.590> obviously

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
been doing a lot of work and obviously

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.710 
been doing a lot of work and obviously
running<00:01:25.640> for<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.910> long<00:01:26.030> period<00:01:26.300> of<00:01:26.330> time<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
running for a long period of time the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.240 
running for a long period of time the
bearings<00:01:27.080> inside<00:01:27.410> here<00:01:27.590> start<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.860> get<00:01:28.070> noisy

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
bearings inside here start to get noisy

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.550 
bearings inside here start to get noisy
to<00:01:28.520> have<00:01:28.640> those<00:01:28.820> bearings<00:01:29.360> fail<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.110> it

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
to have those bearings fail and it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.160 
to have those bearings fail and it
seizes<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.580> belt<00:01:31.820> basically<00:01:32.510> rubs<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:32.960> wears

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
seizes the belt basically rubs and wears

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.720 
seizes the belt basically rubs and wears
itself<00:01:33.500> out<00:01:33.740> brakes<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.370> then<00:01:34.460> you've<00:01:34.610> been

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
itself out brakes and then you've been

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.640 
itself out brakes and then you've been
valves<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:35.540> then<00:01:35.750> obviously<00:01:36.170> stuck<00:01:36.440> on<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
valves and then obviously stuck on the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.160 
valves and then obviously stuck on the
side<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.040> road<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.450> addition<00:01:38.750> to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
side of the road so in addition to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.410 
side of the road so in addition to
checking<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.100> spinning<00:01:40.580> these<00:01:40.730> parts<00:01:41.240> while

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
checking and spinning these parts while

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.840 
checking and spinning these parts while
you've<00:01:41.570> got<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.900> belt<00:01:42.170> off<00:01:42.380> for<00:01:43.040> lack<00:01:43.820> of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
you've got the belt off for lack of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.220 
you've got the belt off for lack of
noise<00:01:44.240> because<00:01:44.570> obviously<00:01:44.810> when<00:01:45.140> you're

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
noise because obviously when you're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.980 
noise because obviously when you're
spinning<00:01:45.470> they<00:01:45.680> shouldn't<00:01:45.950> make<00:01:46.010> any<00:01:46.220> noise

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
spinning they shouldn't make any noise

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.139 
spinning they shouldn't make any noise
you<00:01:47.380> should<00:01:47.560> also<00:01:47.740> check<00:01:47.920> things<00:01:48.490> like<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
you should also check things like the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.380 
you should also check things like the
oil<00:01:49.180> pump<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.500> obviously<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.850> water<00:01:52.090> pump

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
oil pump and obviously the water pump

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.719 
oil pump and obviously the water pump
because<00:01:52.750> if<00:01:53.049> you've<00:01:53.259> got<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.649> fire<00:01:54.130> water<00:01:54.430> pump

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
because if you've got a fire water pump

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.210 
because if you've got a fire water pump
every<00:01:55.000> signs<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.600> telltale<00:01:56.380> dripping<00:01:57.040> of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
every signs of telltale dripping of

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.830 
every signs of telltale dripping of
water<00:01:57.250> coming<00:01:57.880> out<00:01:58.000> through<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.299> seal<00:01:58.570> at<00:01:58.750> the
