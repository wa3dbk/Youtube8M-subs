00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.580
 very good to all the kids 

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.930
 welcome to a new gameplay to this 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.410
 first chapter of the guide 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.869
 stop and land survival a game of 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.059
 survival at the time of the 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.910
 dinosaurs and in this first chapter 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.140
 let's see the characters all the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.660
 coffee growers that are in the game for now 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.520
 remember that you are in an alpha phase and 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.450
 well let's see them all from the most 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.039
 basic to the most complex 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.619
 the first one I'm going to leave the one on the right 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.850
 for all the time it's two wooden 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.170
 a torch 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.000
 you will have all the characters in the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.790
 description 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.430
 and then with two wooden that we take 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.620
 from the trees we make ourselves a torch 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.559
 it's pretty good for when it's 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.030
 night and there is darkness with the caves 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.540
 ok let's go step by step after the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.920
 second all of wood and one stone we 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.960
 we can make some balls with these balls 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.000
 What we can do is hunt in a 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.140
 future hunt the dinosaurs with 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.590
 entangling them on the ropes but now 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.030
 it is only served for others 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.700
 other players are going to launch them and the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.520
 tangles are quite difficult to 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.110
 handle is worth in the next 42 for 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.350
 make us a shield 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.799
 OK 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.140
 the shield is quite useful although it 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.570
 it breaks but it is very useful to fight 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.880
 against dinosaurs and for 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.940
 for players because that's how I think it 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.680
 it breaks the iron spears then we 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.680
 we cover here and it just gets dark 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.180
 fair 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:51.340
 well let's leave the shield we take the 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:54.220
 torch and we went to the next go 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.000
 coincidence fair at night the next 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.980
 it's 52 an arch 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.620
 it's hard to manage too but it's 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.530
 pretty useful for hunting the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.360
 dinosaurs you need more hits than 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.620
 with the spear but good a useful object 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.170
 a bow I do not know if I'll be seeing something 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.840
 because it just cost me to put all the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.520
 materials over here the video was cut 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.440
 and I had to put them back new tuna 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.540
 of dollars and so on 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.830
 and it just goes out at night now but good 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.420
 52 the same as him 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.100
 that the bow a spear for me is the weapon 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.230
 more useful because it does insta kill of a 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.710
 hit as much as the dinosaurs 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.180
 small as humans I do not know if what 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.550
 you will be looking good but good 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.430
 yes 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.430
 You already saw the character of the bow 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.310
 ok wait a moment guys please 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.310
 give me a second 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.350
 they are the seconds 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.810
 to make me another torch 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.810
 and so to see better all 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.799
 I'm going to put it here and I'm going to take 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.629
 this and so good we see a little better 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.629
 I can even make myself another 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.240
 and so rather all the changes for 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.650
 that was a kraft eo more 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.650
 of these 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.650
 and we can see him 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.460
 well actually they are the characters 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.000
 more complex by calling them like that for 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.090
 for 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.700
 for your house and that's here before we go to 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.500
 see this craft eo as you see 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.800
 just two of wood and we can 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.070
 make arrows for the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.930
 for the bow I wanted to leave it more for the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.209
 end for this to not 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.480
 to explain the first to the arch because 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.610
 we have 10 dates at the most and so 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.470
 we can recharge our arrows 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.380
 it will be for our home and our 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.930
 tribe first the fire pit that is 222 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.259
 2 stone wood 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.139
 which is simply how you see here a 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.570
 kind of bonfire to cook meat 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.370
 and the fish and thus be able to eat not only 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.160
 the meat that is obtained from the dinosaur 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.720
 we simply put on the face that 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.650
 let's take it there we'll be 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.370
 fire and you're done 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.830
 Now I'm going to fuck, I'm going to light you 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.380
 OK 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.350
 I will put to take the voucher the next 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.470
 the cabin will go towards where we are 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.960
 looking if less for here will be the 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.330
 door for cantons 10 4 with 10 of 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.320
 4 stone wood already costs more to do it 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.700
 we put the tipi here as you see 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.000
 where you look for where the 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.570
 door without everything of what you see 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.040
 dark but it's just that he got 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:15.600
 night in the game equal 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.129
 the next one we are going to look for here 8 of 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.959
 2 stone wood 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.959
 the totem is useful for 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.760
 to make clans in this way that 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.550
 create everything imposes you to put the totem and 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.610
 accept them to the people you want to be 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.080
 his clan and so you can see his name 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.080
 on top of it is quite useful 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.680
 and finally the box that is 15 the cage 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.870
 which is 15 of wood one of this with 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.940
 these slats 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.330
 it is difficult or heavy to get it 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.460
 because you have to be a long time 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.949
 giving the ax 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.870
 as you see besides seeing the coffee growers 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.610
 you are seeing what each object is for 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.960
 but in following offspring of 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:08.500
 survival I will say more carefully 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.330
 how to hunt how to fish all these things 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.890
 and good and these are the characters that 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.260
 there is for now in the game is a version 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.210
 alpha then they will be adding more in a 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.470
 future here we can get dinosaurs and 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.470
 Hunted enemies 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.580
 this month he serves to make clans here 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.890
 for this is our little house for 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.960
 reappear that in the future there will be things 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.960
 to put in and this kind of 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.570
 bonfire to cook our our 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.240
 houses our meals to feed us 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:43.690
 will not be paid sir obviously turn off 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.090
 ok we have here our spear that is 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.919
 the best weapon I believe although the bad is 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.740
 that you have to be close to me 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.569
 then we have very useful balls 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.000
 to hunt people even though they are difficult 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.740
 to give 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.650
 then we have the shield that is a 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.350
 pretty pretty useful object even though it 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.490
 it will break remember this 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.500
 the arc 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.830
 which is quite difficult to manage but 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.620
 which is useful if you have good aim already 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.880
 that two touches hunt a dinosaur 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.880
 I will understand this again 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:21.839
 and we also have and that's it 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.919
 Well this is the first the first 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:25.829
 chapter of the survival guide 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:29.129
 we are attentive because there will be more 

00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:31.229
 chapters of this stomp inland guide 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:33.419
 game that I'm really enjoying 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:36.419
 I recommend it even though it is in a phase 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.249
 very early and very green to be attentive to 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:39.989
 channel because possibly I upload more 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:42.179
 subscribe videos you liked this 

00:07:39.989 --> 00:07:47.149
 guide and give a like and comment what you 

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:47.149
 it seemed like goodbye guys later
