was making the call what were the calls

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.570 
was making the call what were the calls
like<00:00:07.140> when<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.589> decided<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:08.099> go<00:00:08.280> for<00:00:08.429> that

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
like when you decided to go for that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.910 
like when you decided to go for that
first<00:00:09.540> before<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:10.019> dragon<00:00:10.290> then<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.650> went<00:00:10.800> to

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
first before for dragon then we went to

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100 
first before for dragon then we went to
MIT<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.309> we<00:00:12.300> pushed<00:00:12.570> down<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.750> mid-south

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
MIT and we pushed down the mid-south

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.020 
MIT and we pushed down the mid-south
really<00:00:13.410> fast<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.309> were<00:00:14.400> way<00:00:14.610> faster<00:00:15.000> than

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
really fast and you were way faster than

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.810 
really fast and you were way faster than
them<00:00:15.299> because<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.719> were<00:00:15.780> pushing<00:00:16.020> us<00:00:16.230> five<00:00:16.410> and

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
them because we were pushing us five and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
them because we were pushing us five and
on<00:00:17.820> top<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.210> Savannah<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.109> Evelyn<00:00:19.470> will

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
on top of that Savannah and Evelyn will

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.650 
on top of that Savannah and Evelyn will
go<00:00:19.830> flow<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.310> none<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.699> them<00:00:20.910> recalls<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.449> just

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
go flow and none of them recalls is just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.090 
go flow and none of them recalls is just
straight-up<00:00:21.869> died<00:00:22.140> when<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:22.470> try<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> defend

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
straight-up died when they try to defend

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.460 
straight-up died when they try to defend
and<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:24.119> think<00:00:24.449> they<00:00:24.600> tried<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> recall<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.380> few

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and I think they tried to recall a few

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.400 
and I think they tried to recall a few
times<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:26.099> well<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.359> called<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
times as well and they just called to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.050 
times as well and they just called to
like<00:00:28.710> don't<00:00:29.039> finish<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.970> just

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
like don't finish them and it's just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
like don't finish them and it's just
they<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.689> caught<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.230> die<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.619> can

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
they get caught and they die and we can

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.190 
they get caught and they die and we can
end<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> game<00:00:32.239> my<00:00:33.239> god<00:00:33.420> they<00:00:33.630> died<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.020> went

the<00:00:34.320> game<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.680> seem<00:00:34.890> very<00:00:34.920> calm<00:00:35.370> right<00:00:35.640> now

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the game you seem very calm right now

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
the game you seem very calm right now
but<00:00:36.120> try<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.780> emulate<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.140> little<00:00:37.410> bit<00:00:37.559> about

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
but try and emulate a little bit about

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.470 
but try and emulate a little bit about
what<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.610> moment<00:00:38.730> because

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
what it was like at that moment because

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.250 
what it was like at that moment because
it<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.170> close<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.660> don't<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it was close and I I don't know it's

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.869 
it was close and I I don't know it's
like<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.590> pretty<00:00:43.860> crazy<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.700> finish

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
like it's pretty crazy to like finish

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.010 
like it's pretty crazy to like finish
the<00:00:45.090> game<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.870> mainly

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the game like that but it's mainly

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
the game like that but it's mainly
because<00:00:46.289> people<00:00:46.860> don't<00:00:46.950> base<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.430> them<00:00:47.579> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
because people don't base from them it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.670 
because people don't base from them it's
not<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.750> much<00:00:48.780> else<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.559> know

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
not really so much else because we know

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200 
not really so much else because we know
we<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:49.860> fastened<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.370> them<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> they<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
we are fastened in them and they have to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.549 
we are fastened in them and they have to
base<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.660> point<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.379> base

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
base at that point if they don't base

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.590 
base at that point if they don't base
obviously<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.460> keep<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.149> if

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
obviously we can just keep going and if

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
obviously we can just keep going and if
they<00:00:54.780> die<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.320> even<00:00:55.469> end<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> game<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
they die we can even end the game and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
they die we can even end the game and
that's<00:00:56.280> basically<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.850> happened<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> we

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that's basically what happened that we

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.549 
that's basically what happened that we
just<00:00:57.600> flashed<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.050> them<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.289> killed<00:00:58.500> them

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just flashed for them and killed them

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
just flashed for them and killed them
and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.940> could<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.180> end<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.660> he

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and then we could just end because he

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
and then we could just end because he
didn't<00:01:00.989> finish<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.289> race<00:01:01.440> timings<00:01:01.829> well

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
didn't finish the race timings well

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
didn't finish the race timings well

through<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> rest<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
through a little bit of the rest of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
through a little bit of the rest of the
game<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.210> versus<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> brown<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:07.740> beta

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
game up versus a brown and I think beta

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
game up versus a brown and I think beta
doll<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.610> Twisted<00:01:08.970> Fate<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> kale

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
doll the Twisted Fate with the kale

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.340 
doll the Twisted Fate with the kale
first<00:01:10.080> pick<00:01:11.060> mmm<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.570> kale<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.140> really

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
first pick mmm well kale is just really

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.690 
first pick mmm well kale is just really
strong<00:01:13.560> right<00:01:13.710> now<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.520> because

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
strong right now it's not really because

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
strong right now it's not really because
there's<00:01:15.210> any<00:01:15.390> specific<00:01:15.930> countertrade<00:01:16.409> or

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
there's any specific countertrade or

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.740 
there's any specific countertrade or
whatever<00:01:16.920> she's<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.210> strong<00:01:18.509> even

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
whatever she's just really strong even

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
whatever she's just really strong even
if<00:01:18.810> she<00:01:18.960> gets<00:01:19.110> behind<00:01:19.290> she's<00:01:19.710> feeling<00:01:20.100> like

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
if she gets behind she's feeling like

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
if she gets behind she's feeling like
she's<00:01:21.150> probably<00:01:21.689> strongest<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> game

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
she's probably strongest in the game

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
she's probably strongest in the game
right<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.799> outside<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.369> Kassadin<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:25.020> just

aggressive<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.850> wanted

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
aggressive because we know they wanted

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.999 
aggressive because we know they wanted
to<00:01:30.270> picture<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> was<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> real<00:01:31.829> struggle

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to picture it but it was a real struggle

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.649 
to picture it but it was a real struggle
first<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> wanted<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> two<00:01:33.390> versus

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
first because we wanted the two versus

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
first because we wanted the two versus
two<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.990> then<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:34.710> hard<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.360> we

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
two but then that one really hard and we

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
two but then that one really hard and we
ended<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.689> falling<00:01:36.960> behind<00:01:37.200> due<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> gang

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
ended up falling behind due to a gang

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
ended up falling behind due to a gang
and<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> meant<00:01:38.670> CF<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.329> jump<00:01:39.630> around

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and that meant CF could also jump around

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
and that meant CF could also jump around
so<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.500> had<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> pressure<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.430> second

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
so we had a lot of pressure on a second

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660 
so we had a lot of pressure on a second
so<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.380> very<00:01:43.649> important<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.280> or

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so this is actually very important we or

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.889 
so this is actually very important we or
an<00:01:44.820> important<00:01:45.149> week<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.540> guys<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
played vs gamut and didn't win that game

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.160

and then won the game for fanatic it's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.539 
and then won the game for fanatic it's
kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> old<00:01:49.560> school<00:01:49.680> teams<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.220> against

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
kind of the old school teams up against

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
kind of the old school teams up against
each<00:01:50.640> other<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.329> make<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> those<00:01:51.840> two

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
each other what do you make of those two

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.630 
each other what do you make of those two
matches<00:01:52.229> well<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> draw<00:01:53.520> his

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
matches well what do you draw his

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
matches well what do you draw his
conclusions<00:01:54.149> from<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:56.810> think<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.170> picking

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
conclusions from that I think of picking

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.039 
conclusions from that I think of picking
bands<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.369> weak<00:01:59.579> because

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
bands right now is pretty weak because

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.420 
bands right now is pretty weak because
when<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.170> scrimp<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:01.799> necessarily<00:02:01.920> play

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
when we scrimp we don't necessarily play

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
when we scrimp we don't necessarily play
against<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> same<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.060> since<00:02:03.299> we're

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
against the same time since we're

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
against the same time since we're
playing<00:02:03.630> against<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.079> which<00:02:04.469> made<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> really

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
playing against now which made it really

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.040 
playing against now which made it really
hard<00:02:05.040> to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
hard to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.830 
hard to
to<00:02:06.650> make<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.280> really<00:02:07.640> proper<00:02:08.150> strategy<00:02:08.450> for

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
to make a really proper strategy for

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.450 
to make a really proper strategy for
them<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.080> practicing<00:02:09.590> going<00:02:09.800> into<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.250> week

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
them and practicing going into this week

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.730 
them and practicing going into this week
so<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.210> think<00:02:11.480> our<00:02:11.600> picks<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:11.900> bans<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.350> week

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
so I think our picks and bans this week

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.290 
so I think our picks and bans this week
but<00:02:12.890> pretty<00:02:13.100> weak<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.550> we<00:02:14.000> could<00:02:14.180> definitely

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
but pretty weak and we could definitely

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.240 
but pretty weak and we could definitely
lost<00:02:14.660> both<00:02:14.870> games<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.740> game<00:02:15.950> right<00:02:16.190> now

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
lost both games like this game right now

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.030 
lost both games like this game right now
we<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:17.180> could<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:17.450> lost<00:02:17.570> as<00:02:17.780> well<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.320> we<00:02:18.890> need

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
we we could have lost as well so we need

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.010
