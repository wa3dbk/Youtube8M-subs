00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 welcome to the Sunday construction seminar of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.870
 pool.eu 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.700
 d3 of the connection diagrams 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.280
 this one sees the schedule again 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.770
 viewing is the combination of a hollow 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.439
 heating and hot sale 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.109
 this combination is very beneficial because on 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.510
 this way the solar heating 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.330
 between 3 and 5 years 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.330
 reimbursed on saving electricity 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.170
 the power is going to be from the filter 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.040
 three 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.710
 that if the temperature of the roof 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.770
 is higher from the pool water from the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.809
 heats water that directs solar energy 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.879
 and back to heat 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.520
 afterwards the water goes through the heat 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.699
 found this setup has the advantage 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.280
 that when the sun shines fully the water 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.829
 in the sun heating is only heated 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 not about the heat pump 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.130
 so generally get through this 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.130
 or sorry a nice energy saving 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.210
 Wiring diagram for putting heat on each 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.270
 heats up has an optimum to offer 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.340
 that she usually rain is around 6 out of 9 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.890
 hour per hour to the optimum area 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.470
 through the heat to be able to steer 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.470
 is required to have a bypass 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.170
 the middle one on the circled faucet can 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.619
 by closing the tap completely 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.619
 will have all the water that is over the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.130
 filter is filtered lightly over the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.649
 heat deal as they circle the faucet 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.829
 is open most of it 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.479
 water will circle the crane and 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.260
 only a small part through the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.040
 heat pump 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.730
 that way the door can be so 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.890
 middle to circo the tap closed or full 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.500
 or half close 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:19.120
 pan because the offering comes the heat 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:22.690
 send the upper bead 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.190
 is always full of porridge this tap is not 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.530
 really needed in 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.530
 bypass and heats up but is useful 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 if the heat pound is defective and it 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 be disconnected 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.240
 supposed left tap at the bottom 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 is left 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.280
 is normally half transferred this tap 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.430
 by opening it halfway 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.270
 ensures that it heats up in the heat 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.120
 circuit 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.260
 pressure is usually found to be warm 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.370
 pressure sensor 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.830
 and as soon as this pressure sensor is pressure 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.530
 mates the sensor that there is also one 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.580
 water flow through the heat people goes and 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.430
 will be the heat pump 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.610
 functional if there is no pressure 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.680
 perceived, heat goes up in an alarm 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.120
 that she thinks no water through 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.019
 distorted or dissipates most heat or 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.870
 even up to 20 kilowatts 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.430
 can be controlled with a fuse 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.340
 god between 16 and 25 grams per bus 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.970
 and then a fuse with a characteristic 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.530
 that had a high peak voltage 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.530
 start up the heat pump 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.320
 the general connection diagram 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.420
 at the top left you see the filters 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.350
 and from the filter we go to one 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.020
 series 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.110
 heaters first solar heating that 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.490
 name heat pump that we possibly set the standard 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.780
 so what all heaters stand e-bike 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.960
 pass 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.060
 and the reason why solar heating 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.430
 First state is because this is the cheapest 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.800
 energy supplies the heat 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.550
 gives good copper energy from the 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.420
 heat exchanger so this stands for top 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:19.750
 with grave from the series of heaters 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.690
 we usually go to a spring van 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.260
 then go to a water treatment 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.050
 device that sat table electronic side 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.960
 or believe us and rather shirt us 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.000
 bunch of ether or possibly others 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.280
 devices 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.390
 these devices are protected with a 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.470
 antique coincidence or such that it 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.470
 malfunctioning of 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.630
 of the devices is not possible that 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.630
 for example, very sour or whole 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:01.440
 chlorinated water in uv lamp and 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.440
 could end up in confusion 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.760
 all uv lamp and 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.990
 water treatment soester standing in 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.150
 bypass 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.790
 making the forest is a good practice 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.070
 that if one of the devices were broken 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.270
 or can not hear colors 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.590
 functioning or 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.140
 surface pro has the whole device or 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.150
 lettuce can be taken while whole 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.150
 installation continues to work 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.380
 just a motion about documents 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.840
 calculators 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.390
 on the site can find links next to him 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.530
 even though customers these are excelsheets that 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:45.620
 allow you to very quickly because price of 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.780
 certain item 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.040
 sample paper is a turbo 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.400
 calculator' 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.530
 for a curb and by it 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.850
 adjust the blue 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:02.480
 numbers or blog options 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.820
 you can very quickly price 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.820
 arrange materials for you
