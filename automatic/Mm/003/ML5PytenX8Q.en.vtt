up there there there up there was any of
those<00:00:27.599> teams<00:00:28.039> I<00:00:30.019> think<00:00:31.019> that's<00:00:31.320> about<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

of<00:00:34.680> things<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> think<00:00:35.840> for<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> most<00:00:37.110> part

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
of things but I think for the most part

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500 
of things but I think for the most part
teams<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.860> were<00:00:38.280> together<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> long<00:00:39.090> time

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
teams that were together for a long time

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
like the Bulldogs and the bees and the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
like the Bulldogs and the bees and the
Rojo's<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.329> stuff<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.870> there's<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
Rojo's and stuff like that there's a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860 
Rojo's and stuff like that there's a
certain<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:44.239> timing<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.690> from

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
being in a team for a long time as

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.799
