00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.019
 if you take such a picture 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.809
 has composed individual shots too 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.669
 then a panorama about photo match 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.860
 you usually get one 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.110
 Bend in the picture that's no further 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.390
 dramatic is also relatively natural 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.609
 I had the camera slightly down 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 inclined and the foreground as possible 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.420
 to take up and not too much 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 to be on top of it and it happens 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.769
 Of course, then automatically that one 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.780
 horizon continues up and ever 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.640
 Continue a line from the center line 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.920
 the farther away it gets 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.049
 bent so far not worrisome 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.909
 Of course it is not beautiful 

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.470
 That's why we should do this bend 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.140
 get rid of them again and should return 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.360
 Take out of the picture there is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 several possibilities for it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.809
 is a well let's not say 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.850
 You can not say old-fashioned that way though 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.680
 There is a traditional possibility 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 a classic and a modern one and me 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.839
 wants to show all three times go 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.729
 because of the edit menu in the 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.940
 transform dialog and bring me here 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.650
 deform 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.320
 this has been known for several years 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.240
 versions and here I have mine 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.480
 I can just touch it now 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.940
 pull down and can take care of that 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.910
 that I am simply against the bend 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.550
 work then though in the middle 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.890
 no touches are direct I can here 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.750
 tackle these crossroads and can 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.430
 which also pull down and now 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.860
 I work through the whole thing 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.210
 bild durch macht that here and here above 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.650
 also still and thus have a bend 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.720
 wonderfully worked out 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.640
 So you see so much work is it 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.440
 I can not even mine here 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.660
 landscape a little bit equalize 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.850
 or distort depending on what I like 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.640
 would like to do something like that 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.340
 can here to the edge go over the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.870
 only thing I want to ask her what 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.910
 They absolutely should not do any 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.850
 gross distortions to get in here 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.280
 they should be careful that this 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.560
 single former rectangles and now 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.750
 curved rectangles that are about 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.090
 the same size, what you have on 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.100
 no case should do it here yes 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.290
 you can do that if you can do this 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.880
 bend here but would like to be there 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.440
 you certainly run the risk 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.030
 resolution here is too low if they 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.070
 the print may be that you 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.870
 their ugly artifacts find that 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.940
 you should avoid it all that would be 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.010
 just a network resolution so that one 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.800
 only for web needs then it passes through 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.709
 but oh well so I'm not a fan of it 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.290
 I would rather do that this way 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.330
 former rectangles all about 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.140
 the same size at least remains 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.670
 you are then relatively close to the original 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.940
 we break times, and I watch my times 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.410
 another possibility to over 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.610
 I'll get that from the grid 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.650
 in form is only times there already a 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.270
 a little faster finished there you need 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.280
 not big to fumble but that 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.680
 works like this I set 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.100
 here in the corner a anchor point 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.570
 another anchor point in the right 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.760
 upper corner and now I just need 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.670
 still in the middle of a anchor point 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.560
 set and thus my picture down to 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.540
 pull so long then you are 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.210
 usually fall out until so long 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.320
 The lines on the side are roughly parallel 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.570
 run 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.110
 to limit the picture then I can do that 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.820
 whole confirm and can now over the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.670
 move dialog a bit more 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.380
 go upstairs and have mine 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.020
 Recording also goes into the heart so 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.170
 a little faster is a little bit too 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.550
 Modern is something at least something 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.350
 not so long on board 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.600
 Photoshop is there but it works 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.640
 In any case, that's the way I go 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.260
 that back to ours 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.210
 starting basis and now there are still 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.890
 a third way off it in this 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.410
 The version is really charming 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.590
 it works great and the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.630
 works like this over the following 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.690
 filter menu I find here the adaptive 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.000
 Wide angle correction click the times 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.470
 and now get this dialog is still 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.209
 not much happened but i can now 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.820
 work with this dialogue if I am 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.820
 for example, this tool here 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.620
 use and now from left to right 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.810
 or right to left no matter here 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.820
 if they pull a line first 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.709
 I'm aiming straight in the middle 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.200
 thus carries the fact that that bill 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.570
 a line the further you get from the horizon 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.549
 the more it is bent away 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.169
 if I do the whole thing so after 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.450
 sat up then they see that the 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.560
 line is bent more exactly that 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.780
 same would happen if i did it 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.840
 put down and here on the horizon 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.270
 I want my line in about this 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.980
 Horizontally fit works great me 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.340
 can let go now and have with it 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.000
 my recording completely equalized 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.820
 can there be a little bit more 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.870
 straighten that he looks like that then 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.550
 I have to scale it a bit so we can 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.100
 here again our entire content 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.229
 Reinbekommen it can then confirm and 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.979
 have this way 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.260
 probably the fastest and 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.710
 most perfect of all corrections in 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.710
 to get
