at the side I know what this blocking
the<00:01:11.280> Sun<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.670> hit<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:11.970> eyes<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:13.020> looking

bit light through it
that's<00:01:17.340> good<00:01:17.490> indication<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> needs<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> be

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that's good indication it needs to be

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.109 
that's good indication it needs to be
changed<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> times<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.000> can

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.950 
kinds of debris stuck inside the pleats
this<00:01:26.280> isn't<00:01:26.549> ridiculously<00:01:27.030> bad<00:01:27.240> best<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.840> they

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
this isn't ridiculously bad best if they

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
this isn't ridiculously bad best if they
do<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.600> let's<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:31.250> always<00:01:32.250> checking<00:01:32.759> outside

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
thin but I didn't have a new air filter
so<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.700> didn't<00:01:48.329> change<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:48.810> someone

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
