00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.760
 space all ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.400
 gentlemen will weaken dmitriya this in peter 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.669
 helped autotroo made a show 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.519
 Now will inspect the second block on 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.529
 fabric creation in which we learn 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.800
 taking advantage of the low but modifier people 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.450
 also 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.310
 make beautiful skatin capable 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.919
 decorate any trainer 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.889
 Now it's like the wind that during the round 

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:28.489
 desk faces pass 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:29.960
 they have more 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.210
 radius smaller segments more 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.200
 parties 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.250
 I get something like a state round table 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.640
 of course we are made by 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 dimensions how much really tired and what 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.640
 then using toshich quality real 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.430
 tables 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 but now we drew a plane 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.830
 added him segments 30 by 30 like 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.130
 in the first block 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.330
 but what we see 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.420
 our metropolitan appreciate the radial shape 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.700
 so by name there 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.900
 in the structure let's say so far and wide 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.930
 and here it is bad he will not be able to create 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 beautiful folds 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.339
 on importing such tasks delete 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.950
 make it a cloth 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.120
 new method for us much more interesting 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.600
 present flat sucks right kabu 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.410
 tongue 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.590
 following the example of the size of the flame 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.290
 which is what was removed 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.190
 and apply to this rectangle 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 card modifiers the moment my enter 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.680
 This modifier is interesting because 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 creates from object 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.320
 why interesting pseudo chaotic pieces 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 tour 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.870
 with this although not required 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.530
 a similar structure takes an example from them 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.600
 better to make beautiful folds will 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.250
 hesitate 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.010
 we need to install a little bit 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.540
 more bentse color is the density 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.500
 just do not overdo it trying to have 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.940
 value may need to break down by 3 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.610
 otherwise you risk 200 computers 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.470
 I put 0 2 he is remarkably visible 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.720
 dense structure 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.530
 raise to a little bit raised select both 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.620
 objects and kremenyuk modifier close 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.670
 weak 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 now it will get into the dialogue who is he 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.110
 the process of beginning, we choose a cylinder 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.919
 there is an object for collision 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.709
 put Kalish silent Kiev and increased 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.010
 values ​​from all 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.289
 but four centimeters is fine 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:15.919
 choose a rectangle 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.270
 set the fabric 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.889
 choose NIS 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.459
 as you can see the cress went off the settings in 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.340
 you will have to change them later 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.670
 but in this tutorial we set the default 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.179
 losses 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.609
 I run the simulation wish commanders 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.489
 Moreover, the club and see what kind of 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.389
 it will turn out 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.729
 you must immediately see a terrible result 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.519
 but we forgot to change the simulation settings 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.779
 stop our house is trimmed 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.009
 and take all the settings 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.969
 more are completely bad 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.169
 five will be completely bad just right 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.169
 we can even 4 himself koryazhme one 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.169
 and this is running 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.569
 calculations 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.399
 symbolism local 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.239
 some kind of high speed 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.809
 wait an hour 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.159
 we have very difficult structures 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.119
 but the fall went 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.649
 speed of falling tissue gradually 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.809
 increases 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:12.619
 well ns Oleg accelerate faster 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.409
 faster and windows say not very 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.109
 great the higher the rate of falling 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.939
 all harder to computer 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.499
 discovered tissue collisions 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.480
 by itself 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.860
 and with other subjects and here if 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.429
 interest so smartly somali cried dante 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.969
 that is, local simulations in 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.589
 depressed state 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.649
 there is up to this button to reset 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.179
 drop rate at 0 and 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.939
 and forces companies without acceleration to begin 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.099
 this button 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.449
 and the fall slowed down dasha practically 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.350
 has stopped 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.480
 squad push somali clock boat for five 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.279
 in a row in the most usual way 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.639
 but only now she has to type 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.519
 speed again which does not allow her to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.979
 end up too fast 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.689
 but I’ll have to wait a long time 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.349
 until he calm there finished 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.129
 hang out 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.629
 at the bottom 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.519
 and generally it is better not to give and hang out 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.270
 down below 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.290
 and catch about at the moment the number of planets that is 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.790
 Now we wait for the sledge until it hangs 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.970
 quite so salary in any way 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.310
 and at this point on the simulation 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.849
 safely stop 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.929
 as an option but what to wait until she 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.680
 chat before the court noted that Tatarstan 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.859
 and stop by herself 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.889
 but it makes no sense to spend so much time 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.740
 it is clear that she took almost 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.059
 correct form 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:26.629
 and we turn off all the more club 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:28.639
 I will stop the calculations 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.919
 we got a very nice cut fabric 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.130
 by some wrinkles 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.260
 and this is almost the final option but will require 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.120
 specific to what processing 6 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.180
 let's remove the cylinder first 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.499
 is no longer needed 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.459
 then we instead fits normally 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:44.529
 table 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.159
 in size which the mother of Salenko creation 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.949
 Well, the failure itself will be converted 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.090
 table field 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.439
 right click 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.400
 envelope here because it was a field 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.840
 yes but note very healthy folds 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.009
 sms osama folds nothing 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.900
 but smoothed out no worse than the rest 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.900
 So did by the summer of details was field 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.580
 Then Oms iron these very folds 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.080
 for this 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.080
 we transfer traditional method well 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.800
 so first turn on writes suisse to be 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.839
 is visible 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.599
 frame objects dumplings 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.599
 modifier tube flys 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.870
 with which to smooth out went 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.370
 all field models 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.820
 kv kan of course with an eye but so far with 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.319
 this wild amount 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.569
 extra polygons in places where you are not 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:34.449
 required 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.879
 with big and krasin still worse 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.770
 tourismus is very bad for 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.059
 smoothing fabric 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:41.589
 let's remove it 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.689
 we need a different modifier 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:44.879
 despite 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.889
 called Prague Judge cop 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.650
 he is able to smooth the object 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.349
 only where really 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.349
 It is necessary to increase the sensitivity 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:53.969
 heads difficult 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.429
 our house in the settings modifier procession 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.849
 with a button giving those events to decide 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.710
 adaptive smashed 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.250
 as you can see he offers different 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.880
 options smooth low to high 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.270
 plus additional manual control 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.639
 but on average to the mainland 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.639
 and see that he added some 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.409
 the number of polygon checks there will be 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.749
 you must not tale chikhachev great view 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:18.619
 on which dogs 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.929
 once again sailors division from favorite roles 

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:22.740
 parties 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.569
 contribution now structure now very 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.849
 looks good then again 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:28.919
 Dubovitskaya 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.580
 but now nothing has happened 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.879
 for the groom and no one else to 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:34.939
 our cancellation 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.489
 father activision and if we want to smooth 

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:39.729
 ideal turn on mode 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.240
 arbitrary 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.780
 as it seems, and tests pallix and parameters 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.129
 in Abkhazia coal 10, the custom team will build 8 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.439
 and superimposed another smoothing layer already 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.809
 with custom 

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:52.879
 angle after hayam 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.550
 and here in the key is off visible 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.419
 the difference is huge and in this case I will 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.839
 try not to connect too much 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.499
 visible face mode 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:03.919
 and we get chic fabric of this 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.649
 Someone roughness but trust with texture 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:07.749
 we do not see them 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:10.930
 vacation and children on off 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.960
 let's open the editor 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.570
 materials and see how 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.999
 the texture will transform the result 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.289
 assigning material against us delivered 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:21.569
 petmol 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:23.169
 first use their table 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:24.789
 with hooks 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:26.580
 give ground 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.380
 and you can see that with the texture 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.009
 in the end be much better 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.349
 especially interesting is what is wonderful 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.770
 follows all the folds 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.000
 but by the way it will be even better kind of places 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.349
 the texture is replaced by a larger pattern 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.369
 let's say thawed 

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:44.989
 and since it seems we got a great 

00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:46.099
 result 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.429
 really exactly neat rag with 

00:07:48.429 --> 00:07:49.749
 wonderful 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.619
 imposed her picture 

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:54.969
 On this found approach to the end 

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:56.550
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.550
