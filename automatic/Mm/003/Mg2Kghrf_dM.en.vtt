00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
know that's the best thing that is the I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.469 
know that's the best thing that is the I
guess<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.670> reason<00:01:55.850> they<00:01:56.060> say<00:01:56.299> I'm

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
guess the the the reason they say I'm

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.880 
guess the the the reason they say I'm
not<00:01:56.509> I<00:01:56.840> was<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.079> successful<00:01:57.409> that's<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.680> only

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
reason they could come up with and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.760 
reason they could come up with and
that's<00:01:59.840> fine<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.290> if<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.590> don't<00:02:00.740> follow
