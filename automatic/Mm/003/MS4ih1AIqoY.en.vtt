 youtube how are I am nightmare 'and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.500
 welcome to this new video is 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.700
 well- known the metal of the tanks already 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.289
 that these are the ones who are in charge of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 receive all the damage as a punching bag 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.400
 so that your equipment arrives and you can finish 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.750
 with the enemy easily without a doubt 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.310
 some these champions are have a 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.280
 great presence within the game and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 dominating each of the games all 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.800
 which I will mention below 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.690
 not only stand out for the incredible 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.860
 resistance that they also have for the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.690
 way in which they unfold inside 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.629
 of the game and can help get the 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.399
 heading forward in fifth place we have 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.110
 to carry it offers a great 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.940
 mobility which helps to make guns 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.219
 very effective is perfect for 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.749
 exchanges hurt and press lines not 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.249
 it takes mana and if you play it correctly 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.019
 you can take your rivals out of the lane 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.489
 without any problem causing it to 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.829
 back and taking advantage of the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.839
 situation in fourth place we have to 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.219
 mccain a very useful champion both in the 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.620
 phase of lines as in the country team 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.269
 has good cessation thanks to his cv and his 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.889
 double puts a difficult situation to your 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.690
 enemies in case one of your 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.670
 colleagues decide to help you with a gang 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.290
 On the other hand, it is also very good for 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.909
 start confrontations and sulky is from 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.159
 great help since it serves with a kind 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.050
 of shield reducing damage by 20% 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.790
 towards him and his companions 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.680
 another very important quality is that it is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 a champion very easy to use an aspect 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.090
 negative is that at the beginning you can consume 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.220
 large amounts of mana in third 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.660
 place we have bolivar he is a terror 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.460
 for many players because with only 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.110
 see what goes behind you makes you leave 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.030
 running and not stop because once 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 that you reach backward demand and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.840
 you will be easy prey for him and his 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 Companions can be a very good 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 option to start fights thanks to their 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.790
 skills your passive is very useful 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.230
 during the lines phase as it will give you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 a great advantage in confrontations of 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.400
 one against one taking by surprise at 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.190
 his enemies and only arm themselves so that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.440
 can create large amounts of damage 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.000
 secondly we help and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.770
 skills so full of slowdown 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.290
 of movement and rising in the air 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.820
 and stunning basically makes a 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.770
 large amount of cessation which is something 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.300
