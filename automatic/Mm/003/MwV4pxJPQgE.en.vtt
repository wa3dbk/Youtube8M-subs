on<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> speeder<00:00:34.500> bike<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:36.540> looking<00:00:36.840> at

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
on a speeder bike and now I'm looking at

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.590 
on a speeder bike and now I'm looking at
these<00:00:37.079> more<00:00:37.380> closely<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.300> think<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.390> might<00:00:39.540> be

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
these more closely I think they might be

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.229 
these more closely I think they might be
the<00:00:39.809> same<00:00:40.079> exact<00:00:40.469> figure<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:41.239> subtle

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the same exact figure with subtle

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.420 
the same exact figure with subtle
differences<00:00:43.200> I'll<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
differences I'll get to that in just a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
differences I'll get to that in just a
second<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:45.600> take<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> look<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> box
