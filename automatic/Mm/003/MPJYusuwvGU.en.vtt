almost unusable in this car and it's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.250 
almost unusable in this car and it's
really<00:02:38.209> because<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.660> way<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> car<00:02:39.140> is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
really because of the way the car is

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.930 
really because of the way the car is
geared<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.040> we're<00:02:40.220> going<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.370> go<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> little

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.370 
to the 373 rear end on this car it hooks
up<00:03:05.720> very<00:03:06.230> well<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.860> car<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.790> really<00:03:08.780> amazing

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
up very well this car is really amazing

up very well this car is really amazing
on<00:03:09.500> how<00:03:09.680> well<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.100> hooks<00:03:10.280> up<00:03:10.459> with<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
on how well it hooks up with with the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.270 
on how well it hooks up with with the
extra<00:03:11.450> horsepower<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:12.290> thought<00:03:12.950> I'd<00:03:13.130> be

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
extra horsepower I thought I'd be

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.720 
extra horsepower I thought I'd be
spinning<00:03:13.730> them<00:03:13.880> all<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.180> time<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.829> 420

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
spinning them all the time this is a 420

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.100 
spinning them all the time this is a 420
horsepower<00:03:16.850> car<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:18.380> 5<00:03:18.620> liter<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.910> car<00:03:20.180> and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
horsepower car it's 5 liter this car and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.310 
horsepower car it's 5 liter this car and
that's<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.410> 32<00:03:21.769> valve<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.640> car<00:03:22.970> has<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.329> 4.6

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
that's the 32 valve this car has the 4.6

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.699 
that's the 32 valve this car has the 4.6
liter<00:03:24.739> 32<00:03:25.310> valve<00:03:25.579> engine<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:27.290> was<00:03:27.380> rated

liter 32 valve engine and it was rated

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.550 
liter 32 valve engine and it was rated
at<00:03:27.799> 305<00:03:28.640> horsepower<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.720> they<00:03:29.959> say<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.350> makes

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
at 305 horsepower but they say it makes

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.660 
at 305 horsepower but they say it makes
me<00:03:30.769> closer<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> 320<00:03:32.480> horses<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:34.010> it's

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
me closer to the 320 horses it's it's

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.130 
me closer to the 320 horses it's it's
very<00:03:34.910> quick<00:03:35.739> but<00:03:36.739> but<00:03:37.280> first<00:03:37.579> gear<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.209> almost

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
very quick but but first gear is almost

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.800 
very quick but but first gear is almost

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
you'll notice about these cars is the

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.370 
you'll notice about these cars is the
Mach<00:04:18.230> 1<00:04:18.260> has<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.070> much<00:04:20.030> more<00:04:20.420> of<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.810> muscle<00:04:21.079> car

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
Mach 1 has a much more of a muscle car

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.840 
Mach 1 has a much more of a muscle car
kind<00:04:21.829> of<00:04:21.920> Rumble<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.490> it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
kind of Rumble to it

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.060 
kind of Rumble to it
the<00:04:23.750> five-o<00:04:24.740> has<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.810> almost<00:04:26.810> docile<00:04:27.500> sounding

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
the five-o has is almost docile sounding

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.190 
the five-o has is almost docile sounding
in<00:04:28.190> comparison<00:04:28.850> it's<00:04:29.480> got<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.630> lot<00:04:29.810> more<00:04:29.840> power

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
in comparison it's got a lot more power

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.840 
in comparison it's got a lot more power
the<00:04:31.130> power<00:04:31.490> comes<00:04:31.820> on<00:04:32.000> very<00:04:32.930> high<00:04:33.650> on<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.340> RPM

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
the power comes on very high on the RPM

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.870 
the power comes on very high on the RPM
scale<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.630> doesn't<00:04:35.960> feel<00:04:36.290> as<00:04:36.590> strong<00:04:36.980> until

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
scale so it doesn't feel as strong until

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.270 
scale so it doesn't feel as strong until
you<00:04:38.090> really<00:04:38.510> hit<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.860> whereas<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.070> Mach<00:04:40.250> 1

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
you really hit it whereas the Mach 1

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.400 
you really hit it whereas the Mach 1
feels<00:04:41.030> very<00:04:41.419> strong<00:04:41.900> really<00:04:42.350> at<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.620> low<00:04:42.800> end

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
feels very strong really at the low end

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.080 
feels very strong really at the low end
you<00:04:45.410> know<00:04:45.590> it's<00:04:45.770> a<00:04:45.860> muscle<00:04:46.040> car<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.520> just<00:04:46.790> it

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
you know it's a muscle car it just it

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.290 
you know it's a muscle car it just it
feels<00:04:47.510> tough<00:04:48.130> but<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.190> runs<00:04:49.340> out<00:04:49.550> of<00:04:49.610> steam<00:04:49.850> at

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
feels tough but it runs out of steam at

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.180 
feels tough but it runs out of steam at
the<00:04:50.330> top-end<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:52.580> 5<00:04:52.880> oh<00:04:52.910> now<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:54.380> just<00:04:54.710> pulls

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
the top-end the 5 oh now it just pulls

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.110 
the top-end the 5 oh now it just pulls
like<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.640> freight<00:04:55.970> train<00:04:56.000> from<00:04:56.630> about<00:04:57.940> 3500<00:04:58.940> on

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
like a freight train from about 3500 on

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.409 
like a freight train from about 3500 on
up<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.510> 7000<00:05:00.410> it's<00:05:00.620> just<00:05:01.250> amazing<00:05:01.910> how<00:05:02.120> much

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
up to 7000 it's just amazing how much

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.540 
up to 7000 it's just amazing how much
power<00:05:02.690> it's<00:05:02.930> got<00:05:03.140> you'd<00:05:03.830> never<00:05:04.070> know<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.370> until

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
power it's got you'd never know it until

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.870 
power it's got you'd never know it until
you<00:05:04.880> hit<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.330> let<00:05:05.540> it<00:05:05.570> let<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.140> grev<00:05:06.880> we'll

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
you hit it and let it let it grev we'll

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.290 
you hit it and let it let it grev we'll
go<00:05:08.030> for<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> little<00:05:08.300> test<00:05:08.690> drive<00:05:08.810> here
