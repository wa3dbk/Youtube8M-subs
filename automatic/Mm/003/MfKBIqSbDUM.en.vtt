00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.490 

well<00:00:06.109> I'm<00:00:06.529> an<00:00:06.740> abdominal<00:00:07.189> radiologist<00:00:07.880> so

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
well I'm an abdominal radiologist so

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.200 
well I'm an abdominal radiologist so
much<00:00:09.500> of<00:00:09.680> my<00:00:09.799> work<00:00:09.830> is<00:00:10.280> with<00:00:10.670> computer

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
much of my work is with computer

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.109 
much of my work is with computer
tomography<00:00:11.510> I<00:00:12.340> think<00:00:13.340> sub<00:00:13.520> millisievert

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:14.119 
tomography I think sub millisievert

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.209 
tomography I think sub millisievert
imaging<00:00:14.570> is<00:00:14.750> something<00:00:15.529> that<00:00:15.650> we're<00:00:15.860> going<00:00:16.100> to

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
imaging is something that we're going to

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.210 
imaging is something that we're going to
see<00:00:16.610> very<00:00:16.850> soon<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:18.170> certainly<00:00:18.650> in<00:00:18.800> smaller

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
see very soon and certainly in smaller

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.130 
see very soon and certainly in smaller
patients<00:00:19.850> I<00:00:19.970> think<00:00:20.000> we're<00:00:20.750> going<00:00:20.960> to<00:00:21.080> be

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
patients I think we're going to be

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.679 
patients I think we're going to be
pretty<00:00:21.320> much<00:00:21.589> there<00:00:21.919> with<00:00:22.160> IM<00:00:22.460> or<00:00:22.730> i<00:00:22.910> think

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
pretty much there with IM or i think

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.390 
pretty much there with IM or i think
that's<00:00:23.929> where<00:00:24.320> we're<00:00:24.589> really<00:00:24.830> on<00:00:25.009> the<00:00:25.160> cusp

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
that's where we're really on the cusp

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.779 
that's where we're really on the cusp
right<00:00:25.669> now<00:00:25.880> i<00:00:26.529> dos'<00:00:27.529> has<00:00:27.769> been<00:00:28.009> a<00:00:28.220> really<00:00:28.550> good

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
right now i dos' has been a really good

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.499 
right now i dos' has been a really good
too<00:00:29.410> however<00:00:30.410> if<00:00:30.679> we<00:00:30.859> actually<00:00:31.039> look<00:00:31.279> at<00:00:31.699> IM<00:00:32.210> or

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
too however if we actually look at IM or

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.440 
too however if we actually look at IM or
compared<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:33.650> idle<00:00:34.190> some<00:00:34.489> we<00:00:34.640> have<00:00:34.880> done<00:00:35.210> that

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
compared to idle some we have done that

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.440 
compared to idle some we have done that
from<00:00:35.720> dumb<00:00:35.989> comparisons<00:00:36.770> both<00:00:37.490> in<00:00:37.730> calaveras

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.670 
when we actually started off working
with<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.250> am<00:02:13.430> more<00:02:13.700> we<00:02:14.480> were<00:02:14.690> talking<00:02:15.230> about<00:02:15.380> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
with I am more we were talking about the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.979 
with I am more we were talking about the
number<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.269> seconds<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:17.420> would<00:02:17.600> take<00:02:17.840> to

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
number of seconds it would take to

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.320 
number of seconds it would take to
generate<00:02:18.470> an<00:02:18.590> image<00:02:18.890> now<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:19.790> talked<00:02:20.180> about

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
generate an image now we talked about

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.660 
generate an image now we talked about
the<00:02:20.599> number<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:20.930> images<00:02:21.560> we<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.040> generate<00:02:22.430> per

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
the number of images we can generate per

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.360 
the number of images we can generate per
second<00:02:23.120> having<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.110> reconstruction<00:02:24.650> time<00:02:25.040> that

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
second having a reconstruction time that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.280 
second having a reconstruction time that
will<00:02:25.550> allow<00:02:25.819> us<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.030> actually<00:02:26.600> reconstruct<00:02:26.900> an

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
will allow us to actually reconstruct an

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.990 
will allow us to actually reconstruct an
average<00:02:27.590> study<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.100> three<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.580> five<00:02:28.730> minutes

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
average study in three to five minutes

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.970 
average study in three to five minutes
means<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.569> these<00:02:30.380> are<00:02:30.620> studies<00:02:30.950> that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
means that these are studies that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.309 
means that these are studies that
actually<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.700> be<00:02:32.030> done<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.989> regular

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
actually can be done on a regular

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.500 
actually can be done on a regular
scanner<00:02:33.830> with<00:02:34.250> them<00:02:34.400> within<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.209> normal

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
scanner with them within the normal

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.930

workflow of a regular work day it could

looks<00:02:49.250> as<00:02:49.459> if<00:02:49.489> it's<00:02:50.209> going<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.630> change<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
looks as if it's going to change the

looks as if it's going to change the
