 mean yes the new console that on 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.809
 Android is based 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.480
 and I am seriously working two hours today 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.460
 been to the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.989
 c.de c64 point one now 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.719
 emulator to get things going 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.770
 van robert pants liana kind of 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.280
 world famous programmer who as one 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.539
 emulators newport to oh yeah and that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.010
 is your heavenly typhus pleuris cunt 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.899
 it was not normal i had the oh yes 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.600
 I had to be with micro usb 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.869
 micro usb ready body one i had to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.729
 connect to a to a PC and only then 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.480
 I could in the right folder 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 you know nothing support for usb 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.650
 for memory sticks usb disk and I became 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.810
 From what that works all needs ideas 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.300
 those that how you should connect 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.990
 really fucking fucking fucking provocative what 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.640
 the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.820
 and once again I think 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.580
 90% of the rooms do not work because the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.830
 media does belong to it 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.760
 touch a keyboard 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.440
 will emerge 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.270
 but unfortunately that typhus and later not the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.670
 input on the keyboard you accept 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.220
 so you often do all those things 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.080
 have trainers and you know in advance 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.000
 you don't cracker groups that then i lied 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.450
 pushing away your shape that one can 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.830
 no where is the fucking unplayable and 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.090
 do you know the games pussy value i can 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.020
 when laying down but I have the how yes 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.630
 purchased for 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.790
 for the emulators for the rose and someone 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 said at my previous item when i like it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.620
 alerts that there was such a growth yes you said 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.369
 for the 130 euros it paid 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:12.030
 You can really do a lot of old emulator games 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.420
 You can get rid of what old games buy in 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.190
 feet the the nintendo wii store for it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.500

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.840
 shopping thick sweetness and release of yes 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.540
 that is heavy and so it looks even better 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.890
 so well now i'm only with 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.060

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.810
 been again that 's a big one 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.610
 disappointment 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.230
 I am going to do a number of other emulators 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.690

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.970

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.430
 annoying and you were allowed at the moment 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.690

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.140
 and I say that in all my disappointment 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.300
 now perhaps in the midst of frustration 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.220
