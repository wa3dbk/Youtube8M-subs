really<00:01:07.640> feel<00:01:08.030> any<00:01:08.329> discomfort<00:01:08.450> especially

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
really feel any discomfort especially

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.710 
really feel any discomfort especially
with<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.520> infusion<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.060> pain<00:01:11.270> medicine

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
with the infusion of the pain medicine

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.680 
with the infusion of the pain medicine
but<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:13.340> was<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.760> lot<00:01:13.970> better<00:01:14.180> than<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.540> thought

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
but it was a lot better than I thought

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.020 
but it was a lot better than I thought
it<00:01:14.750> would<00:01:14.870> be<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.920> most<00:01:16.100> discomfort<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:16.909> i

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
it would be the most discomfort that i

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.180 
it would be the most discomfort that i
thought<00:01:17.240> was<00:01:17.479> mainly<00:01:17.720> with<00:01:18.080> my<00:01:18.260> teeth<00:01:18.530> just

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
thought was mainly with my teeth just

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.700 
thought was mainly with my teeth just
because<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.880> sensitive<00:01:20.300> roots<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.320> other

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
because of the sensitive roots but other

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.980 
because of the sensitive roots but other
than<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.549> seem<00:01:23.180> like<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:23.510> had<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.750> cold
