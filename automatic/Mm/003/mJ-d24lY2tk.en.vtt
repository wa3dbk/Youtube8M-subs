00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
the seats industry realized an asura

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.230 
the seats industry realized an asura
among<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> seed<00:01:24.030> industry<00:01:24.260> that<00:01:25.260> since<00:01:26.240> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
among the seed industry that since I

among the seed industry that since I
bird<00:01:27.960> seeds<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.530> expensive<00:01:28.830> as<00:01:29.640> they

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bird seeds are very expensive as they

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.690 
bird seeds are very expensive as they
should<00:01:29.910> be<00:01:30.240> counted<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.870> not<00:01:31.080> wait<00:01:31.490> that's<00:01:32.490> why

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
should be counted in not wait that's why

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.780 
should be counted in not wait that's why
we<00:01:32.910> looked<00:01:33.120> for<00:01:33.360> counting<00:01:33.810> solution<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.560> we

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
we looked for counting solution and we

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.670 
we looked for counting solution and we
scanned<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.300> market<00:01:36.690> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.140> existing

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
scanned the market of the existing

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.180 
scanned the market of the existing
equipment<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.370> we<00:01:39.030> chose<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.330> have<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:40.800> pilot

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
equipment and we chose to have the pilot

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.320 
equipment and we chose to have the pilot
with<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> new<00:01:41.970> technology<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.900> data<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:45.060> found

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
with the new technology of data we found

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.020 
with the new technology of data we found
the<00:01:45.600> data<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.350> found<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.880> technology<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pilot was successful and that's why we

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.820 
pilot was successful and that's why we
ran<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.450> commercial<00:01:51.780> packing<00:01:52.380> of

ran into a commercial packing of
expensive<00:01:53.720> hybrid<00:01:54.720> seeds<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:59.580> see<00:01:59.850> the
