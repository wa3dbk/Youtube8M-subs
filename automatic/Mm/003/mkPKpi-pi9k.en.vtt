00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.610 
together once everything looks pretty
well<00:03:19.700> mixed<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.269> you'll<00:03:20.930> still<00:03:21.200> see<00:03:21.349> a<00:03:21.380> few

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
well mixed in you'll still see a few

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.979 
well mixed in you'll still see a few
lumps<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.069> that's<00:03:22.220> okay<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:23.569> got<00:03:23.750> all<00:03:23.870> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
lumps and that's okay you got all the

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.839 
lumps and that's okay you got all the
wet<00:03:24.170> ingredients<00:03:24.349> are<00:03:24.980> mixed<00:03:25.099> into<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.610> dry

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
wet ingredients are mixed into the dry

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.120 
wet ingredients are mixed into the dry
we're<00:03:26.630> going<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.840> turn<00:03:26.989> our<00:03:27.049> temperature<00:03:27.650> on

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
we're going to turn our temperature on

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.030 
we're going to turn our temperature on
to<00:03:28.579> medium-low<00:03:29.170> now<00:03:30.170> we<00:03:30.260> have<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.590> stir<00:03:30.860> this

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
to medium-low now we have to stir this

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.520 
to medium-low now we have to stir this
constantly<00:03:31.849> don't<00:03:32.209> stop<00:03:32.540> or<00:03:32.810> walk<00:03:33.019> away<00:03:33.319> from

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
constantly don't stop or walk away from

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.080 
constantly don't stop or walk away from
it<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:33.860> we're<00:03:34.400> going<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.579> this<00:03:34.850> will<00:03:35.000> take

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
it and we're going to this will take

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.690 
it and we're going to this will take
about<00:03:35.239> five<00:03:35.600> minutes<00:03:36.190> approximately<00:03:37.190> and

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
about five minutes approximately and

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.520 
about five minutes approximately and
what<00:03:38.480> you'll<00:03:38.660> find<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.109> it's<00:03:39.230> going<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.410> get

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
what you'll find is it's going to get

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.770 
what you'll find is it's going to get
thicker<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.160> thicker<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.850> harder<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.480> stir

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
thicker and thicker and harder to stir

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.220 
thicker and thicker and harder to stir
as<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.350> flower<00:03:43.220> cooks<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:44.139> eventually<00:03:45.139> i'll

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
as the flower cooks and eventually i'll

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.160 
as the flower cooks and eventually i'll
just<00:03:45.440> turn<00:03:45.560> into<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.799> big<00:03:46.010> ball<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:47.269> once<00:03:48.019> it

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
just turn into a big ball and once it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.559 
just turn into a big ball and once it
does<00:03:48.319> that<00:03:48.609> will<00:03:49.609> turn<00:03:49.790> off<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.090> heat<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.450> let

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
does that will turn off the heat and let

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.599 
does that will turn off the heat and let
it<00:03:50.750> cool<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.650> that's<00:03:51.859> pretty<00:03:52.069> much<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.280> we're

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
it cool and that's pretty much it we're

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.220 
it cool and that's pretty much it we're
now<00:03:52.760> alright<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:53.540> now<00:03:53.690> we're<00:03:53.900> just<00:03:53.930> going<00:03:54.079> to

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
going to feed the mouth of this over the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.060 
going to feed the mouth of this over the
top<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.430> funnel<00:04:31.640> so<00:04:32.300> I'm<00:04:32.390> going<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.600> just

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
top of the funnel so I'm going to just

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.990 
top of the funnel so I'm going to just
squeeze<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.460> on<00:04:35.380> like<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.000> I'm

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
squeeze this on like that and I'm

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.760 
squeeze this on like that and I'm
actually<00:04:38.210> going<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.660> pull<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:38.960> down<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.320> want<00:04:39.650> to

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
actually going to pull it down I want to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.750 
actually going to pull it down I want to
do<00:04:39.920> is<00:04:40.960> put<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.050> over<00:04:42.230> the<00:04:42.440> funnel<00:04:42.830> up<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.670> the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
do is put it over the funnel up to the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.430 
do is put it over the funnel up to the
point<00:04:44.000> where<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.300> starts<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.690> widen<00:04:45.140> out<00:04:45.230> on

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
point where it starts to widen out on

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.440 
point where it starts to widen out on
the<00:04:45.680> balloon<00:04:45.950> that<00:04:46.340> way<00:04:46.460> it's<00:04:46.610> much<00:04:46.970> easier<00:04:47.000> to

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
the balloon that way it's much easier to

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.480 
the balloon that way it's much easier to
put<00:04:47.690> your<00:04:47.780> play-doh<00:04:48.050> in<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.950> we<00:04:49.070> take<00:04:49.280> our

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
put your play-doh in it so we take our

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.240 
put your play-doh in it so we take our
play-doh<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.780> make<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.110> into<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> cylinder

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
play-doh and you make it into a cylinder

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.100 
play-doh and you make it into a cylinder
shape<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.210> want<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.420> hang<00:04:53.600> on<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:54.020> your

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
shape and you want to hang on to your

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.150 
shape and you want to hang on to your
balloon<00:04:54.380> so<00:04:54.530> it<00:04:54.590> doesn't<00:04:54.800> slip<00:04:54.920> off<00:04:55.100> the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
balloon so it doesn't slip off the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.310 
balloon so it doesn't slip off the
funnel<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:55.910> just<00:04:56.330> push<00:04:56.570> it<00:04:56.600> right<00:04:56.960> in<00:04:57.140> there

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
funnel and just push it right in there

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.440 
funnel and just push it right in there
until<00:04:57.620> we<00:04:57.830> get<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> desired<00:04:58.790> size<00:04:59.150> that

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
until we get it to the desired size that

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.150 
until we get it to the desired size that
we<00:04:59.510> want<00:04:59.780> it<00:04:59.900> to<00:04:59.930> you'll<00:05:00.530> know<00:05:00.680> because<00:05:00.920> you'll

we want it to you'll know because you'll

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.440 
we want it to you'll know because you'll
be<00:05:01.220> able<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.400> squeeze<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.090> you'll<00:05:02.270> say<00:05:02.420> oh
