00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.570
 the legends never die 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.360
 after defeating the unit charges 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.740
 have finished with Colonel Paul and 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.340
 until you have destroyed a few weapons 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.170
 powerful as sago with office word 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 and having had to eat a lot 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.720
 snakes on the road was not that disgusting 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.939
 returns the best soldier of the 20th century 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.939
 the master of combat c zero 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.929
 smith for friends 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.370
 hey that happens very good family to all 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.660
 objectives today I bring you a small 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.329
 review of what I was able to experience 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.390
 in the new metal gear solid 5 ground 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.390
 zero 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.050
 The first thing I did when I started the game 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 was to read me the backgrounds that count 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 what happened in metal gear solid peace 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 walker that if guys I still have not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 played waiting to be able to do it in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.040
 cooperative with a friend and that little girl 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 in the background while reading about what happened 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.710
 and my dear voice heroin me 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 They made me thrill and shudder 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.979
 Of course this will only happen to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.540
 a big fan of the saga but what 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.540
 I intend to convey my feelings 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.320
 in the main mission our mission 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.630
 is to rescue two hostages who have 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.270
 captured on a military base it seems 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.860
 simple truth actually it is but for 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.869
 a package like me can be complicated 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.780
 a little bit especially since now without 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.979
 radar becomes a little bit more difficult 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.570
 it seems that the experience of stealth 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.759
 something more realistic and you have to 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.740
 be very aware of the environment and everything 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.440
 what surrounds you because if you do not, it's 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.850
 probably not soon to discover the 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.800
 only help you have to know if 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.509
 you are in danger of being discovered is 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.700
 an indicator that appears in the direction 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.800
 from where they are visualizing you and that 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.270
 intensifies over time the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.729
 stage is set at night and it's 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.679
 quite broad but the best of all is 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.970
 that we can roam wherever we please and 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.979
 This is one of the most novelties 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.990
 attractive of the game that allows us 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.450
 have a great freedom when it comes to 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.590
 perform the missions with what 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.750
 Regarding control, I found 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.580
 quite comfortable and movement and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.370
 The character's actions are much less 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.260
 orthopedic than in previous titles the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.060
 only drawback that I have seen is to the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.040
 time to lie down to enter a conduit 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.840
 of ventilation since if you do not charge 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.459
 very well to the hole the character returns 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.000
 to get up again and again doing 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.860
 almost impossible to escape from enemies 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.020
 the combat improvement is also remarkable 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.020
 especially in the circus combat which 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.910
 I consider more fluid and dynamic and now 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.650
 If they hurt us, we will not have to 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.480
 stop to take the classic ration 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.550
 simply with time we will recover 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.860
 all health like many other games 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.720
 of action there are people who have complained about 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.060
 this but to me personally I do not 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.800
 displeases at all about the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.709
 technical section just say that I 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.090
 basically the textures seem 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.010
 the environmental effects 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.470
 Illuminations and facial expressions 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.420
 they are simply great, although 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.100
 say that some small elements of the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.989
 scenario takes a while to load 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.360
 I also have to say that I'm playing 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.700
 on xbox 360 but it still looks 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.950
 superbly the sound section has 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.300
 it seemed very good so much the sounds of 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.430
 environment like that of weapons and 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.650
 vehicles and harry soundtracks 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.650
 Gregson-Williams, so under you 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.250
 and as a conclusion, tell you that crown 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.350
 cyrus does not stop being a demo that we 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.300
 have wanted to sell as a game since the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.160
 main story lasts 2 hours yes 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.110
 you're just as packaged as me and if not 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.490
 much less true that then we 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.140
 unlock a few missions 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.940
 secondary but that develop in 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.190
 the same scenario and at different times 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.410
 of the day with which we will not see anything 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.970
 again no doubt this kind of demonstrate 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.950
 made for fans and for those who 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.209
 they need a small dose of metal 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.790
 gear solid 'before we can 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.180
 get us with phantom paint thing that goes 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.180
 for long
