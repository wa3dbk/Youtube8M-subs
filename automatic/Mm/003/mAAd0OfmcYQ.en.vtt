just feel like it needs a little

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
just feel like it needs a little
something<00:00:31.949> extra<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.790> need<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
something extra do you need to get a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.139

sanding mirror and stuff like that but
um<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.660> kind<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.850> it's

um I just think it's really kind of it's
really<00:00:42.210> feminine<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:44.149> like<00:00:45.149> really
