this<00:03:40.260> game<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.680> known<00:03:40.889> for<00:03:41.220> also<00:03:41.819> sand<00:03:42.180> lattice

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
this game is known for also sand lattice

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.780 
this game is known for also sand lattice
and<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.560> mean<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.040> didn't<00:03:44.430> think<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.700> was

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
and I mean I didn't think it was

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.520 
and I mean I didn't think it was
possible<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.329> be<00:03:45.510> emotionally<00:03:45.959> connected<00:03:46.410> to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
possible to be emotionally connected to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:55.120 
possible to be emotionally connected to
sand<00:03:46.859> but<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.549> game<00:03:47.819> doesn't<00:03:48.239> somehow

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.820 

so<00:03:56.130> while<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:56.670> game<00:03:56.880> is<00:03:57.240> really<00:03:58.080> simple<00:03:58.560> it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
so while the game is really simple it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.650 
so while the game is really simple it
does<00:03:59.100> do<00:03:59.310> something<00:03:59.610> pretty<00:03:59.940> interesting

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
does do something pretty interesting

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.050
