00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
it's programmed in there so I showed you

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.589 
it's programmed in there so I showed you
how<00:02:43.920> easy<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.459> for<00:02:44.790> me<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.180> program<00:02:45.569> a

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
how easy it was for me to program a

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.800 
how easy it was for me to program a
distorted<00:02:46.190> sound<00:02:47.239> now<00:02:48.239> I'm<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.569> touch

base on the using the effects access
part<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.860> amp<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:54.120> pulled<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:56.310> clean

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
part of the amp so I pulled up the clean

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.369 
part of the amp so I pulled up the clean
again<00:02:57.299> I'm<00:02:58.230> going<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.470> engage<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:01.019> effects

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
again I'm going to engage the effects

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.550 
again I'm going to engage the effects
access<00:03:01.950> button<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:03.870> let's<00:03:04.079> say<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.319> want<00:03:04.500> to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
access button then let's say we want to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.400 
access button then let's say we want to
add<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> chorus<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.390> I'm<00:03:06.690> gonna<00:03:06.780> go<00:03:06.959> over<00:03:07.109> to<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
you want to use a flange or a phase all

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.710 
you want to use a flange or a phase all
you<00:03:35.959> need<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.230> do<00:03:36.349> is<00:03:36.530> go<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.860> mod<00:03:37.069> type

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.800 

got<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.380> on<00:03:45.470> flange<00:03:45.910> mess<00:03:46.910> with<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.270> intensity

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
got it on flange mess with the intensity

00:03:47.810 --> 00:04:00.830 
got it on flange mess with the intensity
a<00:03:47.840> little<00:03:48.140> bit

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.020 

there's<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.050> flange<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:02.650> now<00:04:02.830> let's<00:04:03.370> do<00:04:03.520> phase

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
there's the flange so now let's do phase

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.710 
there's the flange so now let's do phase
or<00:04:04.420> tremolo<00:04:05.100> there's<00:04:06.100> let's<00:04:06.340> do<00:04:06.490> tremolo<00:04:06.940> it's
