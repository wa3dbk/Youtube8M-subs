in<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:05.069> lesson<00:00:05.339> we're<00:00:05.790> going<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.000> break<00:00:06.150> down

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
in this lesson we're going to break down

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.990 
in this lesson we're going to break down
thirty-second<00:00:07.290> notes<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.309> likely<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.730> be

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
thirty-second notes this is likely to be

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.850 
thirty-second notes this is likely to be
the<00:00:09.240> biggest<00:00:09.599> subdivision<00:00:10.230> you'll<00:00:10.410> ever<00:00:10.559> use

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
the biggest subdivision you'll ever use

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.830 
the biggest subdivision you'll ever use
in<00:00:11.130> your<00:00:11.250> day-to-day<00:00:11.580> drumming<00:00:12.240> it's

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
in your day-to-day drumming it's

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.480 
in your day-to-day drumming it's
unlikely<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.440> you'll<00:00:13.620> need<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.980> use<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
unlikely that you'll need to use it

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.490 
unlikely that you'll need to use it
while<00:00:14.639> first<00:00:14.910> learning<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> play<00:00:15.480> drums<00:00:15.660> but

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
while first learning to play drums but

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.779 
while first learning to play drums but
it's<00:00:16.560> something<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> should<00:00:17.279> learn<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
it's something you should learn and

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.420 
it's something you should learn and
understand<00:00:18.240> anyway<00:00:18.859> take<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> look<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.340> the

understand anyway take a look at the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.490 
understand anyway take a look at the
provided<00:00:20.910> sheet<00:00:21.150> music<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.960> first<00:00:22.170> line

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
provided sheet music the first line

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.679 
provided sheet music the first line
shows<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> full<00:00:23.250> measure<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> thirty-second

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
shows a full measure of thirty-second

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.210 
shows a full measure of thirty-second
notes<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.680> tell<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.160> are

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
notes you can tell that these are

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.099 
notes you can tell that these are
thirty-second<00:00:27.029> notes<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:27.930> have

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
thirty-second notes because they have

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.769 
thirty-second notes because they have
three<00:00:28.529> horizontal<00:00:28.920> lines<00:00:29.539> connecting<00:00:30.539> each

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
three horizontal lines connecting each

three horizontal lines connecting each
group<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> notes<00:00:32.120> now<00:00:33.120> these<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.719> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
group of notes now these are so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.380 
group of notes now these are so
complicated<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.800> count<00:00:35.100> up<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> speed<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.300> we

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
complicated to count up to speed that we

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.479 
complicated to count up to speed that we
actually<00:00:36.809> only<00:00:36.989> count<00:00:37.380> every<00:00:37.860> second<00:00:38.309> note

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
actually only count every second note

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.060 
actually only count every second note
this<00:00:39.329> way<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.870> exactly<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> accounting

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
this way it's exactly the accounting

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
this way it's exactly the accounting
sixteenth<00:00:41.610> notes<00:00:41.879> except<00:00:42.540> every<00:00:42.750> time<00:00:42.930> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
sixteenth notes except every time you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.590 
sixteenth notes except every time you
count<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.610> play<00:00:45.000> two

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
count you actually think or play two

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.979 
count you actually think or play two
notes<00:00:46.610> look<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> second<00:00:48.239> example<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
notes look at the second example in the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.260 
notes look at the second example in the
provided<00:00:49.500> sheet<00:00:49.739> music<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> bar

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

thirty-second<00:00:54.570> notes<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.530> count<00:00:55.770> above<00:00:56.219> each

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
thirty-second notes the count above each

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.479 
thirty-second notes the count above each
bar<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.969> exactly<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> same<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.649> again<00:00:58.770> when
