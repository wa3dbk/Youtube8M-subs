how<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:20.900> pinpoint<00:00:21.470> with<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.800> 2d<00:00:22.130> coil<00:00:22.510> we're

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
how to pinpoint with the 2d coil we're

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.540 
how to pinpoint with the 2d coil we're
not<00:00:23.660> going<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:23.960> use<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.260> pinpoint<00:00:24.830> facility<00:00:25.310> if

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
not going to use a pinpoint facility if

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.429 
not going to use a pinpoint facility if
your<00:00:25.820> detector<00:00:26.270> should<00:00:26.420> have<00:00:26.600> this<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.200> we're

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
your detector should have this so we're

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.320 
your detector should have this so we're
going<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.740> do<00:00:27.890> this<00:00:27.980> without<00:00:28.220> using<00:00:29.000> pin

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
going to do this without using pin

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.280 
going to do this without using pin
points<00:00:29.720> on<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.349> fly<00:00:30.670> so<00:00:31.670> as<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:32.960> get<00:00:33.110> your

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
points on the fly so as you get your

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.479 
points on the fly so as you get your
signal<00:00:34.180> it<00:00:35.180> can<00:00:35.510> only<00:00:35.690> occur<00:00:36.199> down<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.100> center

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489

signal it can only occur down the center
line<00:00:37.699> of<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.970> coil<00:00:39.670> here<00:00:41.199> if<00:00:42.199> you<00:00:42.739> make<00:00:42.769> a

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
line of the coil here if you make a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.650 
line of the coil here if you make a
mental<00:00:43.850> note<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.570> where<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:45.350> signal<00:00:45.769> occurs

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
mental note of where that signal occurs

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.479 
mental note of where that signal occurs
you<00:00:47.660> know<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:48.019> it<00:00:48.110> can<00:00:48.230> only<00:00:48.379> be<00:00:48.590> down<00:00:49.280> this

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
you know that it can only be down this

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
line down the center line you'd then

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.380 
line down the center line you'd then
turn<00:00:53.629> through<00:00:53.870> 90<00:00:54.170> degrees<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.890> do<00:00:55.850> exactly

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
turn through 90 degrees and do exactly

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.030 
turn through 90 degrees and do exactly
the<00:00:56.659> same<00:00:56.690> again<00:00:59.199> one<00:01:00.199> mistake<00:01:00.620> people<00:01:00.860> make

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
the same again one mistake people make

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.299 
the same again one mistake people make
with<00:01:01.519> 2d<00:01:01.850> coils<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:03.010> pinpointing<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.100> first

with 2d coils is pinpointing the first
direction<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.150> then<00:01:05.960> thinking<00:01:06.500> they<00:01:06.650> can<00:01:06.860> go

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
direction and then thinking they can go

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.789

forwards<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.549> backwards<00:01:08.500> where<00:01:09.500> you'll<00:01:09.650> get

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
forwards and backwards where you'll get

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.200

conflicting<00:01:10.369> information<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:11.150> should

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
conflicting information you should

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.109 
conflicting information you should
always<00:01:11.540> turn<00:01:12.080> through<00:01:12.290> 90<00:01:12.590> degrees<00:01:13.119> when

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
always turn through 90 degrees when

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.200 
always turn through 90 degrees when
