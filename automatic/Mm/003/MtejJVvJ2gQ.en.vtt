00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.020
 Alba caught again and Sa we went to the iphone app bowling like that 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.570
 is bought 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.540
 be nice today on the iPad percent were missing here with the iPhone 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.840
 therefore it is disgusting on the iPad even if only the iphone version 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.089
 of the Chilean 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.179
 the need for it to currently rank 8th or 9th of the iphone sales there is 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.550
 By the way, one more 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.649
 a petition that costs a little more 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.759
 Should she ask for his slightly larger graphics 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.780
 No, it does not cost more at 79 cents 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.230
 Bonne Chance new single player mode on one with this took and told me 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.820
 first start 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.410
 And then stop here the optics of a bowling alley can because of Lyon 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.830
 Move and position right on the left 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.160
 to be able to 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.920
 For example, you could build more buildings around fire and then you could 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.049
 Yorn tell me that beautiful son here 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:59.860
 JK's choice 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.710
 and just bring your finger with the ball started rolling and 8 percent in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 Year should of course knock as many pins as possible 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.790
 at first I had thought that the CAPT does not leave much to be allowed 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.090
 but you have to go back later 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.360
 History with Google 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.900
 the river Pennern I thought now that if you have her son and 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.420
 Secondary market that is Google in how much gets one, however, first 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.630
 valuable and then in retrospect, for example, to steer to the right when the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 Summer wants to be poorly accessible 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 Should one use IMF EM Aachen 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.410
 The whole thing can be done to her until one of these ten passes 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.880
 Nia has managed Sar 3 for this each 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 afterwards there is a listing 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.659
 how good you grenades how good you were and to spare years because that's easy 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.170
 Let's take a look back at the minim 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.650
 far too few three different game modes are staged once 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.490
 once again have recorded his plans since you can stop with two three 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.590
 or play four players 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.340
 I am holding a child 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 respectively to play on the same time with or iPhone 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.199
 how so 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.389
 if you still have the case new elections and that can Melanie 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.129
 and will stay ready and go at the start 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:26.899
 Papermaster arrives on the right here. "It's all my turn 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.499
 Hair could have easily fallen over 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.519
 she probably did not want it like me 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.709
 We also get the last corner Ben Hur or not 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.839
 and when we get our wave 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.109
 have betrayed that he met Malte drivers and we can do the old one 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.109
 pass on and then drivers like him could rank his dancers 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.139
 and finally, she gives after 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.139
 Neher this classic mode them computer games 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.439
 that's exactly the same we are a team and play the computer 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.259
 and have to go back to the balls and of course try 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:05.739
 but to knock over 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.260
 yes that was it from the whole game itself legitimate help around again 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.670
 times clarifies that from right to right left to the ball because can therefore 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.909
 can take dignified and with a 2 2 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.859
 if that with the finger Wichern one gets off as FIS with the Bavaria 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.260
 in the settings there is not much music including effects 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:30.089
 and otherwise a few more decided with his word 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:34.999
 which you can of course do through the Game Center otherwise OcÃ© for 79 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:39.219
 Cent is nicely made for play that is not like the 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.279
 but make for a few and in between in the train on the bus or where 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.000
 always 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.849
 it is very nice 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.669
 "If you like such games you can do it right away 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.109
 You can also re-invest with this for Nauen Red if you do not like that though 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.439
 he stands 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.680
 that's what we're leaving the HDE for 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.559
 Decision that we are Voigt 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:00.489
 over 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.969
 Here you can divide yourself and Allgaier you will finally get your video 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.929
 helped repentantly to help with the buying decision
