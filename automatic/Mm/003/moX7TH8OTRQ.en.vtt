00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
soon my offensive line is going to look

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.049 
soon my offensive line is going to look
all<00:00:37.770> different<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.399> waiting<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:38.969> these

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
all different I waiting on these

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.209 
all different I waiting on these
positional<00:00:39.570> collections<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> cards

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
positional collections to like the cards

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
positional collections to like the cards
to<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.820> rare<00:00:42.059> anymore<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.200> start

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
to not be as rare anymore so I start

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.950 
to not be as rare anymore so I start
doing<00:00:43.739> some<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.219> them<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.960> eventually

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
doing some more of them and eventually

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.440 
doing some more of them and eventually
I'm<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:47.000> left<00:00:48.000> guard<00:00:48.090> i'm

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450

Gonzalez<00:01:20.400> I'll<00:01:20.580> probably<00:01:20.759> still<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.210> Shannon

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
Gonzalez I'll probably still use Shannon

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
Gonzalez I'll probably still use Shannon
Sharpe<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.590> his<00:01:22.710> run<00:01:22.920> block<00:01:23.159> strength

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
when I do that as you can see down there

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.980 
when I do that as you can see down there
below<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.200> had<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> playoff<00:01:31.770> Jimmy<00:01:32.100> Graham
