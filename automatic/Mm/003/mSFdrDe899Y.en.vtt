fighter all the laces are these red ones

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.700 
fighter all the laces are these red ones
I<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> red<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.960> must<00:01:49.500> meet

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
I don't think the red like you must meet

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.020 
I don't think the red like you must meet
all<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> video<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> red<00:01:50.490> doesn't<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:50.850> go

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
all the video the red doesn't really go

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510 
all the video the red doesn't really go
with<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> actual<00:01:52.439> shoes<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
with the right of actual shoes so I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
with the right of actual shoes so I
don't<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> goes<00:01:54.180> well<00:01:54.420> together<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
don't think it goes well together so I

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.780 
don't think it goes well together so I
cut<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> black<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.979> maybe<00:01:56.490> some<00:01:56.670> other

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
cut the black but maybe some other

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.120 
cut the black but maybe some other
