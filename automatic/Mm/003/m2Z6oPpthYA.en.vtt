actually wasn't even recording when I
got<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:45.590> nuclear<00:01:46.070> I<00:01:46.130> was<00:01:46.280> just<00:01:46.399> trying<00:01:46.729> to

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
got this nuclear I was just trying to

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.599 
got this nuclear I was just trying to
play<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.390> try<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.320> have<00:01:48.530> fun<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.579> know

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
thankfully just this did save because I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.340 
thankfully just this did save because I
did<00:01:52.640> have<00:01:52.819> my<00:01:52.850> capture<00:01:53.479> software<00:01:53.659> up<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.200> wasn't

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
recording but it kind of records

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.849 
recording but it kind of records
automatically<00:01:56.569> because<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.350> do<00:01:57.409> have<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
automatically because I do have the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.660 
automatically because I do have the
elgato<00:01:58.759> capture<00:01:59.359> card<00:01:59.600> but<00:02:00.140> anyway<00:02:00.679> you<00:02:01.549> know

using this shotgun and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.850 
using this shotgun and
shotgun<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.580> really<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:25.080> really<00:02:25.410> difficult

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
shotgun is really it's really difficult

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.100 
shotgun is really it's really difficult
to<00:02:26.310> get<00:02:26.490> used<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.090> you've<00:02:27.270> never<00:02:27.570> used<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
to get used to if you've never used it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.170 
to get used to if you've never used it
before<00:02:28.230> because<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.890> got<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.400> for

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
before because it's got like that for

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.030 
before because it's got like that for
burst<00:02:30.450> shot<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.260> then<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.710> quick

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
burst shot and then it's like a quick

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.940 
burst shot and then it's like a quick
reload<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.330> more<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.110> for

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
reload and in for more and you get for

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.830 
reload and in for more and you get for
good<00:02:35.310> burst<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.940> then<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.450> reload

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
good burst and then you have to reload

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.290 
good burst and then you have to reload
again<00:02:37.070> unlike<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.250> see<00:02:38.400> me<00:02:38.550> doing<00:02:38.580> here<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
again unlike you see me doing here and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.870 
again unlike you see me doing here and
it's<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:40.320> hard<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.830> get<00:02:40.920> used<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.550> you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
it's really hard to get used to if you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.690 
it's really hard to get used to if you
know<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> only<00:02:42.600> shoot<00:02:43.200> three<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.860> first

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
know you only shoot three of the first

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.730 
know you only shoot three of the first
burst<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.050> shoot<00:02:46.230> once<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.650> have

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
burst and then you shoot once you have

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.350 
burst and then you shoot once you have
to<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.130> quick<00:02:47.400> reload<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.000> then<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.240> guy

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
to do that quick reload and then the guy

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.610 
to do that quick reload and then the guy
kills<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.050> got<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> be<00:02:49.350> really

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
kills you so you got to be really

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.430 
kills you so you got to be really
careful<00:02:49.650> about<00:02:50.190> how<00:02:50.970> much<00:02:51.350> how<00:02:52.350> much

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
careful about how much how much

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.990 
careful about how much how much
ammunition<00:02:52.770> you're<00:02:53.220> using<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.670> everything
