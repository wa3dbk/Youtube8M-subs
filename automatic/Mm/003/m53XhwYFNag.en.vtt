00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
right off the bat I just run right into

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
right off the bat I just run right into
their<00:01:03.780> spawn<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.860> state

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
their spawn that's what I do on a state
I<00:01:05.400> always<00:01:06.210> try<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.960> house

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
I always try and get into this house

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
I always try and get into this house
because<00:01:07.700> if<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.939> aren't<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> house<00:01:09.570> they

because if you aren't in the house they
are<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.070> usually<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.549> case<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
are and that's usually the case so the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.539 
are and that's usually the case so the
fact<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> house<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.340> trying<00:01:14.490> to

Harrier<00:02:19.060> does<00:02:19.210> get<00:02:19.390> me<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.600> ac-130<00:02:20.020> here

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
Harrier does get me to the ac-130 here

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.050 
Harrier does get me to the ac-130 here
and<00:02:20.680> they're<00:02:21.160> really<00:02:21.280> spread<00:02:21.610> out<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.030> it's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
and they're really spread out so it's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.730 
and they're really spread out so it's
I'm<00:02:22.570> kind<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.840> surprised<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.410> was<00:02:23.530> able<00:02:23.620> to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
I'm kind of surprised that I was able to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.800 
I'm kind of surprised that I was able to
get<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.010> nuke<00:02:24.220> they<00:02:25.150> were<00:02:25.270> really<00:02:25.480> spread<00:02:25.780> out

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
get to nuke they were really spread out

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.590 
get to nuke they were really spread out
there<00:02:26.140> was<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> ton<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.470> Harriers<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.100> sky

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
there was a ton of Harriers in the sky

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.820 
there was a ton of Harriers in the sky
but<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> guess<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.170> got<00:02:29.350> some<00:02:29.530> lucky

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
but I guess I just got some lucky

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.670 
but I guess I just got some lucky
bullets<00:02:30.160> there<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.540> able<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.020> get<00:02:32.440> them

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
bullets there and I was able to get them

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.380 
bullets there and I was able to get them
and<00:02:32.890> if<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.580> guys<00:02:33.670> know<00:02:33.880> anything<00:02:34.060> about<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
and if you guys know anything about the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.910 
and if you guys know anything about the
thumper<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.320> don't<00:02:35.500> think<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.800> as

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
thumper is that I don't think it's as

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.130 
thumper is that I don't think it's as
good<00:02:36.130> as<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.850> noobtube<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:37.630> because<00:02:37.930> it

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
good as the noobtube just because it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.660 
good as the noobtube just because it
seems<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.710> takes<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.040> little<00:02:39.250> longer<00:02:39.370> to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
seems like it takes a little longer to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.320 
seems like it takes a little longer to
get<00:02:39.880> out<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.430> kind<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> hard<00:02:42.820> using<00:02:43.210> it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
get out so it's kind of hard using it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.180 
get out so it's kind of hard using it
the<00:02:43.810> one<00:02:43.960> I'm<00:02:44.080> really<00:02:44.320> looking<00:02:44.620> forward<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.950> in

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190
