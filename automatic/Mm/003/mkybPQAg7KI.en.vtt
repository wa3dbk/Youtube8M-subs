00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.029 

you'll<00:02:03.219> see<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.490> close<00:02:03.880> up<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:04.299> still<00:02:04.750> have<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.469> raw

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
you'll see a close up I still have a raw

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.779 
you'll see a close up I still have a raw
edge<00:02:06.420> which<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.600> need<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:08.019> tuck<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.519> that<00:02:09.670> it

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
edge which I need to tuck in so that it

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.250 
edge which I need to tuck in so that it
doesn't<00:02:10.000> unravel<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.959> my<00:02:11.230> work<00:02:11.470> later<00:02:11.769> on<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:14.230> I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
doesn't unravel in my work later on so I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.979 
doesn't unravel in my work later on so I
lay<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.739> work<00:02:14.950> flat<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.550> I'm<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.810> just

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
lay the work flat and I'm going to just

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.360 
lay the work flat and I'm going to just
gently<00:02:17.349> roll<00:02:18.340> those<00:02:19.060> raw<00:02:19.569> edges<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:20.370> which

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
gently roll those raw edges in which

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.020 
gently roll those raw edges in which
creates<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.940> nice<00:02:22.120> tight<00:02:22.959> line<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.849> bottom

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
creates a nice tight line on the bottom

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.610 
creates a nice tight line on the bottom
edge<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.780> my<00:02:26.200> needle<00:02:28.080> from<00:02:29.080> there<00:02:29.379> I'm<00:02:29.560> going

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.050 
edge of my needle from there I'm going
to<00:02:29.920> roll<00:02:30.250> tightly<00:02:30.730> again<00:02:32.610> tucking<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.790> those

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060
