00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.430
 for 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:10.529
 om 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.409
 she 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.659
 voice of america voa it's also someone who does not swear with us 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.359
 so I got a lot of questions about the wireless charger 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.939
 act 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.060
 of people who are wondering how they currently work I told myself 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.919
 that rather than explain it to you I'm going to show you my daughters so it's 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.460
 clear this fight this is the base of the match runner you can click here 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.660
 three small species in the Caucasus that fits your three locations 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.490
 of change 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.370
 thanks base and of course connected to the sector 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.500
 so on a persic wall socket you also see that there is a small usb port 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 and which one can connect to change their mp3 player for example 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.340
 so when you buy the port but you have little cobblestones like 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.780
 this one in the box of the camera 4 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.560
 as you will actually see 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.120
 he was a mini usb port he just laid on the base he inscribed 58 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.240
 with the audible warning to prevent it from replacing 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.869
 masters of the places so you can huge and all he has a 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.270
 mini-crisis but in the state of course it is also true with all the panoply 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.940
 adapter that will allow it fit however most of 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.000
 devices say that will generate one for the nintendo dsi for the ds light in the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.750
 rap for micro usb port for notebooks and jessica simpson she tip 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.750
 to a length with the iphone or ipod the surface 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.920
 so 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.560
 so I'm going to show a little bit what it's called then for accessories 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.070
 that we can buy more for about thirty euros is a doctor who 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.100
 will receive phases 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.530
 nothing ap you place on the corner advantage is that we spent the k bis 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.860
 if the one who connects allows it to the winery these little cobblestones in lumens and 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.470
 physically rollier at the base 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.960
 it's gone I pose 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 my iphone i think i will not do any basic 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.710
 sl is supported ben arfa 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.990
 I am an old laptop added thatice 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 the branch on the micro usb 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 everything rolls for the stone collection 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.019
 I do not have the adapter 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.369
 and here he is charging too see the little red lights used them 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.949
 That's it really works like in the pub with nice little words 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.469
 to pau indicated that the beginning of Charente with three thirds to 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.899
 classification in case 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.989
 Ukraine also wants opportunities to buy accessories for not 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.369
 wrong of different laptops 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.859
 so that's it if you hesitated to get it you now have a 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.679
 idea of ​​how it works it's really like I said like in the 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.719
 advertising while it saves you a lot of cables since the years 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.409
 only one who will take back from base to wall but they played three 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.819
 devices to change at the same time normally the day has had him reproaching 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.329
 players with their respective sons the main price advantage of the net port one has 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.409
 a lot less cables and then it is rather than to say oneself confident 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.989
 wireless laptop here just to you enjoyed this little 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.089
 demonstration of the normative rate and that I give you an appointment in your 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.999
