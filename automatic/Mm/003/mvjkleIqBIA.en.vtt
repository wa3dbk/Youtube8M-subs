man<00:02:27.920> i<00:02:27.980> cannot<00:02:28.700> get<00:02:28.879> over<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.269> so<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.170> know

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
man i cannot get over that so you know

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.369 
man i cannot get over that so you know
here<00:02:30.560> i<00:02:30.590> get<00:02:30.829> to<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.819> eyes<00:02:32.060> lighting<00:02:32.510> up<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.959> i

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
here i get to the eyes lighting up and i

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.910 
here i get to the eyes lighting up and i
think<00:02:33.590> i<00:02:33.620> was<00:02:33.739> trying<00:02:33.950> 346<00:02:34.700> why<00:02:35.560> cuz<00:02:36.560> i<00:02:36.680> always

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
think i was trying 346 why cuz i always

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.610 
think i was trying 346 why cuz i always
get<00:02:37.069> into<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.459> mind<00:02:38.180> frame<00:02:38.299> that<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.840> i<00:02:39.019> get

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
get into that mind frame that the i get

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.720 
get into that mind frame that the i get
killed<00:02:39.860> all<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.129> time<00:02:40.310> while<00:02:40.489> using<00:02:40.640> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
killed all the time while using the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.069 
killed all the time while using the
predator<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.390> i<00:02:41.420> want<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.900> use<00:02:42.049> something

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
predator so i want to use something

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.680 
predator so i want to use something
where<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.799> don't<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.790> stop<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.450> pull<00:02:44.629> out

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
where I don't have to stop and pull out

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.110 
where I don't have to stop and pull out
a<00:02:44.750> laptop<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.560> all<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.760> want<00:02:47.030> to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
a laptop and all that so I want to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.180 
a laptop and all that so I want to
precision<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.720> game<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.379> i<00:02:48.739> figured<00:02:49.069> it's

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
precision this game and i figured it's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.800 
precision this game and i figured it's
good<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.459> sweep<00:02:49.670> up<00:02:49.849> that<00:02:50.000> area<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.599> on<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
good to sweep up that area on the on the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.000 
good to sweep up that area on the on the
side<00:02:51.049> of<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.200> map<00:02:51.349> where<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.530> just<00:02:51.799> bought

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
side of the map where I just bought

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.349 
side of the map where I just bought
because<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.519> lot<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.760> times<00:02:53.000> they'd<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.269> running

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
because a lot of times they'd be running

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.509 
because a lot of times they'd be running
back<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:53.780> forth<00:02:53.810> through<00:02:53.989> there<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.010> that's

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
back and forth through there so that's

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.039 
back and forth through there so that's
why<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.670> take<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:55.970> precision<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.569> on<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.810> map

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
why I take the precision to on this map

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.190 
why I take the precision to on this map
shoulder<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:58.819> know<00:02:58.909> now<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.150> like<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.569> you

got<00:03:03.859> my<00:03:03.980> UAB<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.549> course<00:03:05.019> turn<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.109> lights<00:03:06.319> on

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
got my UAB of course turn the lights on

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.220 
got my UAB of course turn the lights on
oh<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:08.150> don't<00:03:08.450> think<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:08.659> used<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.989> yet<00:03:09.140> because

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
oh I don't think I used it yet because

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.410 
oh I don't think I used it yet because
I've<00:03:09.440> seen<00:03:09.620> what<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:09.859> was<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.129> but<00:03:11.120> now<00:03:11.239> i<00:03:11.269> got

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
I've seen what it was that but now i got

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.819 
I've seen what it was that but now i got
the<00:03:11.510> counter<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.019> gotta<00:03:12.290> get<00:03:12.500> rid<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.680> this

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
the counter so I gotta get rid of this

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.580 
the counter so I gotta get rid of this
so<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.099> could<00:03:13.280> use<00:03:13.400> my<00:03:13.579> UAV<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.030> look<00:03:14.590> bingo

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
so I could use my UAV and look bingo

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.970 
so I could use my UAV and look bingo
triple<00:03:16.489> kill<00:03:16.730> triple<00:03:17.630> score<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.769> course

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
triple kill triple score and of course

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.409 
triple kill triple score and of course
they<00:03:19.099> gave<00:03:19.220> me<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.370> double<00:03:19.669> kill<00:03:19.880> even<00:03:20.299> though

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
they gave me the double kill even though

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.390 
they gave me the double kill even though
obviously<00:03:21.200> you've<00:03:21.380> seen<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.799> was<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.160> trip

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
obviously you've seen it was the trip

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000 
obviously you've seen it was the trip
ether<00:03:22.669> but<00:03:23.169> you<00:03:24.169> know<00:03:24.290> in<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:24.530> game<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:24.980> have
