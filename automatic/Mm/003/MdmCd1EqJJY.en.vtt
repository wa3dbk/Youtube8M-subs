wrestling like she has like him pinned
down<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> although<00:01:50.250> maybe<00:01:50.490> she's<00:01:50.820> saying

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
down and although maybe she's saying

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.080 
down and although maybe she's saying
like<00:01:51.299> no<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.820> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like no get this or do that or was just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090

say you know just kind of no couples
playing<00:01:56.460> around<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.540> really

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
playing around but this was really

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
playing around but this was really
really<00:01:57.960> weird<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.820> trying<00:02:00.060> really

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
really weird so I was trying really

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.760 
really weird so I was trying really
really<00:02:00.299> hard<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> time<00:02:01.290> frame<00:02:01.530> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
really hard to think of a time frame I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.260 
really hard to think of a time frame I
can't<00:02:02.040> give<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> time<00:02:02.430> frame<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.149> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
can't give a time frame for this but it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
can't give a time frame for this but it
was<00:02:03.570> quite<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.049> while<00:02:04.290> ago<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.250> say<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
was quite a while ago I want to say it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.770 
was quite a while ago I want to say it
was<00:02:05.670> at<00:02:05.729> least<00:02:05.850> about<00:02:06.030> three<00:02:06.090> months<00:02:06.600> ago

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
was at least about three months ago

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540 
was at least about three months ago
three<00:02:07.170> four<00:02:07.560> months<00:02:07.799> ago<00:02:07.890> something<00:02:08.220> along

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
three four months ago something along

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.230 
three four months ago something along
those

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
those

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.270 
those
so<00:02:09.510> it<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:09.840> late<00:02:09.990> at<00:02:10.110> night<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.290> usually<00:02:10.680> they

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
so it was late at night and usually they

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.950 
so it was late at night and usually they
go<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.520> bed<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.330> go<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> bed<00:02:12.750> maybe

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
go to bed and then I go to bed maybe

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.460 
go to bed and then I go to bed maybe
sometimes<00:02:13.530> four<00:02:13.950> or<00:02:13.980> five<00:02:14.760> or<00:02:15.150> maybe<00:02:15.470> ten

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
sometimes four or five or maybe ten

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.530 
sometimes four or five or maybe ten
hours<00:02:16.980> later<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.550> don't<00:02:17.970> really<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> set

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
hours later I don't really have a set

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.450 
hours later I don't really have a set
bedtime<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.440> stay<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.100> do<00:02:20.310> my

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
bedtime I like to stay up and just do my

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.790 
bedtime I like to stay up and just do my
own<00:02:20.490> thing<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.630> at<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.380> point<00:02:22.710> in

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
own thing and so at this one point in

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.630 
own thing and so at this one point in
time<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.780> kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:25.110> felt<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> need<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.370> go<00:02:26.520> in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
time I kind of felt the need to go in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.370

kind of sitting around talking about
experiences<00:03:30.840> where<00:03:30.990> we've<00:03:31.020> walked<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.770> our

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
experiences where we've walked in on our

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.920 
experiences where we've walked in on our
parents<00:03:32.310> doing<00:03:32.460> it<00:03:32.700> something<00:03:33.360> weird<00:03:33.540> but

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
parents doing it something weird but

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.630 
parents doing it something weird but
apparently<00:03:34.290> Skylar<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.310> perfect

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
apparently Skylar is just a perfect

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.490 
apparently Skylar is just a perfect
human<00:03:35.730> being<00:03:35.910> he<00:03:36.300> has<00:03:36.480> never<00:03:36.720> ever<00:03:36.870> walked<00:03:37.320> in

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
human being he has never ever walked in

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.650 
human being he has never ever walked in
on<00:03:37.620> his<00:03:37.800> parents<00:03:38.010> doing<00:03:38.400> anything<00:03:39.210> actually

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
on his parents doing anything actually

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630 
on his parents doing anything actually
which<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.960> thought<00:03:40.110> was<00:03:40.260> that's<00:03:40.830> pretty<00:03:41.190> weird

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
which I thought was that's pretty weird

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.100 
which I thought was that's pretty weird
and<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.940> have<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.120> say<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.300> know<00:03:42.480> lucky<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:42.990> him

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
and I have to say you know lucky for him

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.260 
and I have to say you know lucky for him
because<00:03:43.320> we<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:44.460> at<00:03:44.670> least<00:03:44.820> walked<00:03:45.120> in

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
because we have all at least walked in

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.840
