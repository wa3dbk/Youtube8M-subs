00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.370
 people who just treat them with one 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.220
 iphone only my own 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.400
 no one who really plays this fashion like 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.140
 it must be heavy who you played 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.580

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.920
 are all slightly different in a spot 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.980
 then I notice 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.830
 those plastic to shoot much faster 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.840

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.700
 example then you see what is coming as 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.920
 something on the ground as for smart alone 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.170
