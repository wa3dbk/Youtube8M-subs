of<00:00:26.000> go<00:00:26.119> back<00:00:26.300> in<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:26.690> make<00:00:26.990> some<00:00:27.170> tweaks<00:00:27.320> to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
of go back in and make some tweaks to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.349 
of go back in and make some tweaks to
things<00:00:27.770> so<00:00:27.920> i<00:00:27.949> think<00:00:28.070> that<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.520> racetrack

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
things so i think that the racetrack

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.359 
things so i think that the racetrack
period<00:00:29.660> zmax<00:00:29.990> rangarajan<00:00:30.529> be<00:00:30.680> better<00:00:31.130> than

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
period zmax rangarajan be better than

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.970 
period zmax rangarajan be better than
ever<00:00:31.550> for<00:00:31.910> me<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.750> 41<00:00:33.140> natural<00:00:33.559> rolls<00:00:33.830> around

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
ever for me the 41 natural rolls around

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.630 
ever for me the 41 natural rolls around
the<00:00:34.190> park<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:35.390> truly<00:00:35.780> excited<00:00:36.230> we've<00:00:36.739> made

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
the park so is truly excited we've made

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.310 
the park so is truly excited we've made
some<00:00:37.760> tweaks<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.330> should<00:00:38.720> be<00:00:38.839> faster<00:00:39.290> than

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
some tweaks to it should be faster than

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.410 
some tweaks to it should be faster than
ever<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.830> we're<00:00:40.550> is<00:00:40.640> ready<00:00:40.790> for<00:00:40.940> everybody<00:00:41.269> to

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:03.400 

I<00:00:59.680> think<00:01:00.680> it's<00:01:00.890> up<00:01:01.120> use<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.300> as<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:03.079> learning

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
I think it's up use this as a learning

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.380 
I think it's up use this as a learning
opportunity<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.850> think<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.239> we've

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
opportunity and I think that we've

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.149 
opportunity and I think that we've
learned<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.720> lot<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.960> things<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.530> research<00:01:06.979> that

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
learned a lot of things to research that

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.219 
learned a lot of things to research that
we've<00:01:07.310> done<00:01:07.479> through<00:01:08.479> diagnosis<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.110> what

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
we've done through diagnosis and what

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.749 
we've done through diagnosis and what
was<00:01:09.350> going<00:01:09.619> on<00:01:09.710> on<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.009> race<00:01:10.159> traffic<00:01:10.430> and

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
was going on on the race traffic and

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.030 
was going on on the race traffic and
benefit<00:01:11.119> tracks<00:01:11.630> across<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.649> United<00:01:12.920> States

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
benefit tracks across the United States

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
to change the racetrack to add some

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.990 
to change the racetrack to add some

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
everything and all of us and looked at

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.810 
everything and all of us and looked at
everything<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.400> down<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
everything that was going down on the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760 
everything that was going down on the
racetrack<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.870> tried<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.110> fact<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
racetrack and really tried to fact I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.800 
racetrack and really tried to fact I
before<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.550> made<00:02:23.730> our<00:02:23.880> first<00:02:24.030> move<00:02:24.330> before<00:02:24.720> we

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
before we made our first move before we

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
before we made our first move before we
did<00:02:24.960> anything<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:26.010> take<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> major

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
did anything that to take a major

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.710 
did anything that to take a major
decision<00:02:27.000> how<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.360> were<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.630> move

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
decision how we were going to move

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.810 
decision how we were going to move
forward<00:02:28.020> we<00:02:28.290> said<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:29.100> owe<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> our

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
forward we said we get we owe it to our

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.240 
forward we said we get we owe it to our
customers<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.330> our<00:02:30.600> competitors<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.860> anyone

to<00:02:32.460> really<00:02:32.820> find<00:02:33.180> out<00:02:33.420> what's<00:02:33.840> happening<00:02:34.230> here

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
to really find out what's happening here

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.920 
to really find out what's happening here
and<00:02:34.710> it's<00:02:35.430> something<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.850> may<00:02:36.060> save<00:02:36.330> other

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and it's something that may save other

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.080 
and it's something that may save other
