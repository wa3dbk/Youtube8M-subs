00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.640
 okuma is one of the biggest 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.110
 spinning manufacturers and casting 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.290
 bare coils in the world 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.960
 our market is the brand that appeared 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.340
 it almost disappeared for a while and 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.290
 in general, it was a bit strange 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.880
 because in almost all 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.390
 any major countries where 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.530
 fishing is popular reels okuma very 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.690
 very common in this exhibition i 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.370
 I managed to understand that now we have Sakuma and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.079
 everything is fine i saw a big stand on 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.359
 which presents almost all 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.600
 assortment of coils of this brand in 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:53.140
 Particularly here is what I hold in my hands 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.840
 the first time is the rtx model 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.940
 last year and the year before she was in 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.989
 two small sizes but specifically 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.780
 size was 30 this is 35 size this is already 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.850
 average dimensions that allow 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.360
 use this reel in spinning 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.820
 class from medium to medium heavy 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.820
 we know perfectly well that this coil 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.710
 different in that it is relatively 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.840
 easy for its size here 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.640
 matching material when used 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.130
 this traction is very 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.880
 a decent size of 35 may be interesting 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.240
 not only light lovers but also those who 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.649
 catches classes above is the middle class then 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:40.119
 there are spinning with dough somewhere in the area 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:42.280
 at 28 grams we are up to 35 maybe up to 37 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.799
 gram coil itself is not heavy but 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.320
 while it is quite dimensional that it 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.540
 we will represent ourselves soon 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.490
 because the season is starting soon but here 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.330
 it is interesting that the first time I was 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:00.720
 I hold this size in my hands 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:04.320
 but this is what I saw for the first time exactly 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.680
 at the exhibition this is the 2015 model 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.570
 there is one subtle point here 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.979
 the name of this coil it is not yet 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.290
 was approved 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.200
 But if you look at what is written there 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.440
 on the box 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.959
 it is written I would read it as kei muse 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.060
 in fact, this name was working 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.160
 and she will be a little different she will be well 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.190
 how would I read it in Latin 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.360
 seymour remember this combination 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.420
 sounds 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.280
 What is she interested in because she is even more 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 budget than rt 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.050
 x this indicates that the coil will be 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.640
 claimed in terms of what is now 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.190
 still don't sell very well 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.950
 expensive coils and this price level 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 I think it will be very interesting 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.640
 I can tell many at once that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.549
 the same thing we have with the rtx coil there 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.400
 good laying pattern and smooth winding 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.489
 we can quite rightly expect here from 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.220
 This series coil is also the size 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.180
 such an average size that is 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.150
 about 35 by the standards of battery Lacum 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.099
 a little bit my own gradations of sizes here are 25 and 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.690
 30 is such a light 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:20.090
 and this is already medium light and above is very 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.609
 nice and rotation meaning quantity 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.000
 bearings and their quality is enough 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.590
 good plus I hope at least 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.109
 least I have not tried this coil 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.579
 I will try soon 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.280
 good stowage 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.139
 we finally we can see others there 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.540
 options from woloku male coils 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.500
 which we knew from past years it 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.069
 the same 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.859
 Helius actually in my opinion such 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.510
 Here is the reincarnation of the battery in relation to 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.850
 spinning in our conditions began 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.620
 helios coil it was the first model 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.010
 really easy really with good 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.940
 styling after it demanded 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.180
 take some time in order 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.190
 to lower the price to the market a little 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.709
 led coil and rtx series 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.540
 this is what we have now here is a coil with 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.160
 not yet an approved name 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.920
 finally but remember it 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.849
 appearance I think that this year 2015 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.849
 she get to talk about herself
