going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.860> smoother<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
going to have that smoother that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
going to have that smoother that
graduated<00:01:30.240> sole<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.720> again<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.140> more<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
graduated sole and again it's more of a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
graduated sole and again it's more of a
squared<00:01:31.829> off<00:01:32.070> toe<00:01:32.369> box<00:01:32.640> again<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.420> saw<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
squared off toe box again we saw the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.060 
squared off toe box again we saw the
Mohawk<00:01:34.049> come<00:01:34.259> out<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.619> had<00:01:34.740> its<00:01:34.890> own<00:01:35.009> unique

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
Mohawk come out that had its own unique

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.109 
Mohawk come out that had its own unique
flavor<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
flavor to it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.609 
flavor to it
this<00:01:36.390> still<00:01:36.659> has<00:01:36.810> some<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.110> contrast

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this still has some of that contrast

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
this still has some of that contrast
stitching<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.430> opinion<00:01:38.820> gets<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
stitching but in my opinion gets it to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600 
stitching but in my opinion gets it to
the<00:01:39.299> next<00:01:39.540> level<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.960> only<00:01:40.290> $10<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.549> we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the next level for only $10 more now we

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.969 
the next level for only $10 more now we
look<00:01:41.880> at<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> sole<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.740> about

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
look at the sole it's going to be about

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
look at the sole it's going to be about
a<00:01:44.040> 5<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.579> 10<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> skiff<00:01:45.360> stiff<00:01:45.689> scale

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a 5 out of 10 on the skiff stiff scale

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
a 5 out of 10 on the skiff stiff scale
so<00:01:46.350> again<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.829> gonna<00:01:46.950> offer<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.490> moto

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so again it's gonna offer you moto

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.069 
so again it's gonna offer you moto
functionality<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.720> meant<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> be

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
functionality but it's meant to be

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
functionality but it's meant to be
walked<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> round<00:01:49.770> walked<00:01:50.130> around<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.640> all

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
walked in a round walked around in all

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
walked in a round walked around in all
day<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> again<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.840> moto<00:01:52.049> functionality

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
day and again that moto functionality

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.469 
day and again that moto functionality
comes<00:01:52.860> by<00:01:53.070> way<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> SI<00:01:53.549> Irae<00:01:53.850> ting<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> have

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
comes by way the SI Irae ting so I have

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
comes by way the SI Irae ting so I have
ankle<00:01:54.840> protection<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.320> both<00:01:55.500> sides<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
ankle protection on both sides it's a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.770 
ankle protection on both sides it's a
minimum<00:01:56.700> level<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.030> construction<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> pass

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
minimum level of construction to pass

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.300 
minimum level of construction to pass
that<00:01:57.960> rating<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.890> toe<00:01:59.100> box

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that rating and then I have toe box

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399 
that rating and then I have toe box
reinforcements<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.360> heel<00:02:00.600> reinforcement

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
reinforcements I have heel reinforcement

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.050 
reinforcements I have heel reinforcement
again<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> stiff<00:02:02.250> enough<00:02:02.340> boot<00:02:02.700> that's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
again I have a stiff enough boot that's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.580 
again I have a stiff enough boot that's
a<00:02:03.210> nice<00:02:03.420> compromise<00:02:03.810> from<00:02:04.170> style<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
a nice compromise from style and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.929 
a nice compromise from style and
protection<00:02:04.710> that's<00:02:05.280> gonna<00:02:05.460> look<00:02:05.610> great<00:02:05.759> under

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
protection that's gonna look great under

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.370 
protection that's gonna look great under
a<00:02:06.060> pair<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.270> Revit<00:02:06.540> jeans<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.229> normal

flexibility here to potentially wear

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.460 
flexibility here to potentially wear
this<00:02:12.150> boot<00:02:12.360> every<00:02:12.690> day<00:02:12.840> now

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
this boot every day now

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.170 
this boot every day now
comes<00:02:13.680> through<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.890> seasonal<00:02:14.400> nature<00:02:14.520> it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
comes through a seasonal nature it's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.000 
comes through a seasonal nature it's
water<00:02:15.570> repellent<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.380> not<00:02:16.530> waterproof

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
water repellent but it's not waterproof

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.980 
water repellent but it's not waterproof
so<00:02:17.490> there's<00:02:17.640> no<00:02:17.730> membrane<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.420> boot<00:02:18.600> but

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
so there's no membrane in this boot but

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.360 
so there's no membrane in this boot but
what<00:02:19.170> you'll<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.800> all<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.280> your

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
what you'll see is that all of your

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 
what you'll see is that all of your
suede<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.760> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.150> waxed<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.660> all<00:02:22.110> of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
suede is going to be waxed and all of

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.080 
suede is going to be waxed and all of
your<00:02:22.320> leather<00:02:22.560> has<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> PU<00:02:23.130> coating<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.970> and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
your leather has a PU coating on it and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180 
your leather has a PU coating on it and
again<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.780> pull<00:02:24.990> up<00:02:25.170> leather<00:02:25.410> has<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> few

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
again the pull up leather has a few

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.740 
again the pull up leather has a few
different<00:02:26.430> things<00:02:26.520> going<00:02:26.850> for<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.060> has<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> nice

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
different things going for it has a nice

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.600 
different things going for it has a nice
hand<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.010> break<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
hand to it it's going to break in and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.800 
hand to it it's going to break in and
the<00:02:29.730> fact<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.180> pull<00:02:30.360> up<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.690> if

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the fact that it's pull up just like if

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.940 
the fact that it's pull up just like if
you<00:02:30.870> saw<00:02:30.990> pull<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.320> leather<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you saw pull up leather on one of the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.800 
you saw pull up leather on one of the
jackets<00:02:32.400> means<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.180> start<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.570> see<00:02:33.600> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
jackets means that you start to see the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.420 
jackets means that you start to see the
lighter<00:02:34.080> shades<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.770> some<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.040> grain<00:02:35.250> of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
lighter shades of some of the grain of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
lighter shades of some of the grain of
leather<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.330> break<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.780> overtime<00:02:37.170> so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
leather as you break it in overtime so

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.420 
leather as you break it in overtime so
depending<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.740> how<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.890> wear<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.280> how<00:02:38.370> you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
depending on how you wear it how you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.920 
depending on how you wear it how you
walk<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.910> how<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.090> ride<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.600> you're

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
walk in it how you ride in it you're

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.990 
walk in it how you ride in it you're
going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> get<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.530> very<00:02:40.800> uniquely<00:02:41.310> formed<00:02:41.760> boot

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
going to get a very uniquely formed boot

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.820

is singly stitched so I think they

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.540
