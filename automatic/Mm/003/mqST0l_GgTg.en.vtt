00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.080
 where friends of trigger my own nourishes 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.120
 it's not a fresh news many more than 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.400
 nothing in the community is going 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.140
 to like and well maybe many because 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.580
 follow my facebook page yesterday they will have 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.369
 known from which site of published 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.869
 information about airs there are not 28 was 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.689
 presented I think yesterday if I did not 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.070
 agreement or antier not so I think yesterday and 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.590
 one of the characteristics of this 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.410
 system is that it will allow testing 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.010
 apps like in android no but 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.900
 as far as I saw I think there are only 1000 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.460
 let's say that a thousand spaces for 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.250
 testers that is not everyone will be able to 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.300
 but good in what benefits this because 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.710
 when they leave ios 8 officially or 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 for the update in all 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.949
 devices regarding ios 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 they will be able to use good those of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.690
 minecraft stop so they can now yes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.630
 test the ones in the minecraft pocket 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.640
 edition or remove them build for ios 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.409
 not so good I do not know when in 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.810
 the devices are actually updated 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.600
 and is represented but not released from 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.610
 the update I do not know 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.470
 what's up in this in yesterday's world is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
 because I have not gotten that time that I 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.479
 get away from it but it's good news 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.570
 because in the future, they are going to 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.850
 have the possibility of being able to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 test what the minecraft pocket is 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 edition but I saw that Tom says that 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.820
 in amazon a thousand spaces that pass it to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.680
 macerate a thousand people are very few but 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.539
 good at least a minimum of people 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.430
 that they will be able to test what is the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.040
 ios wild 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.600
 on their mobile devices so nothing 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.540
 it is very good news and to clarify 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.630
 nothing more yesterday I said android 4.2 me 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.500
 wrong is that it is android 4.4 points 2 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.240
 the one that I have not between 4.2 but good 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.350
 just to clarify that in nothing guys 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.760

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.430
