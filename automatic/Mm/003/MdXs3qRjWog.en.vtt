00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
and on today's protein bar review I've

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.650 
and on today's protein bar review I've
got<00:00:06.500> a<00:00:06.529> supreme<00:00:07.250> protein<00:00:07.910> bar

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
got a supreme protein bar

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.379 
got a supreme protein bar
peanut<00:00:09.469> butter<00:00:09.710> and<00:00:09.770> jelly<00:00:09.950> style<00:00:10.549> because

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
peanut butter and jelly style because

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.709 
peanut butter and jelly style because
peanut<00:00:11.840> butter<00:00:12.049> jelly<00:00:12.289> time<00:00:13.090> 30<00:00:14.090> grams<00:00:14.480> of

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
peanut butter jelly time 30 grams of

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.790 
peanut butter jelly time 30 grams of
protein<00:00:15.260> and<00:00:15.650> it's<00:00:15.740> carb<00:00:16.219> conscious<00:00:16.640> which

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
protein and it's carb conscious which

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.860 
protein and it's carb conscious which
already<00:00:18.800> makes<00:00:19.040> me<00:00:19.310> suspicious<00:00:19.820> of<00:00:20.360> how<00:00:20.570> much

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
already makes me suspicious of how much

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.950 
already makes me suspicious of how much
sugar<00:00:21.230> alcohol<00:00:21.830> is<00:00:22.010> in<00:00:22.190> here<00:00:22.520> I<00:00:22.640> believe<00:00:23.570> when

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
sugar alcohol is in here I believe when

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.930 
sugar alcohol is in here I believe when
I<00:00:23.990> kind<00:00:24.650> of<00:00:24.680> glanced<00:00:25.100> over<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.490> ingredient

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
I kind of glanced over the ingredient

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.410 
I kind of glanced over the ingredient
list<00:00:26.090> I<00:00:26.270> saw<00:00:26.450> melt<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.870> all<00:00:26.990> was<00:00:27.260> on<00:00:27.380> there<00:00:28.420> too

list I saw melt it all was on there too

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.720 
list I saw melt it all was on there too
much<00:00:29.750> sugar<00:00:30.020> alcohol<00:00:30.560> generally<00:00:31.100> is<00:00:31.190> no<00:00:31.400> good

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
much sugar alcohol generally is no good

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.380 
much sugar alcohol generally is no good
it<00:00:31.940> can<00:00:32.059> do<00:00:32.239> some<00:00:32.770> damage<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:34.010> your<00:00:34.250> GI<00:00:34.579> system

in<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.770> jelly<00:00:52.070> layer<00:00:52.430> which<00:00:52.880> is<00:00:52.910> kind<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.360> cool

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
in the jelly layer which is kind of cool

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.560 
in the jelly layer which is kind of cool
so<00:00:55.130> take<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.340> look<00:00:55.520> at<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.760> on<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.940> top<00:00:56.180> there

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
so take a look at that on the top there

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.229 
so take a look at that on the top there
looks<00:00:56.840> really<00:00:57.200> really<00:00:58.130> nice<00:00:58.430> probably<00:00:59.120> some

looks really really nice probably some

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.799 
looks really really nice probably some
whey<00:00:59.360> protein<00:00:59.870> crisp<00:01:00.170> there<00:01:00.379> on<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.559> top

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
whey protein crisp there on the top

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.959 
whey protein crisp there on the top
alright<00:01:02.809> let's<00:01:03.079> try<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.860> supreme<00:01:04.430> protein

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 
alright let's try the supreme protein

well<00:01:11.910> very<00:01:12.210> chewy<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.810> very<00:01:13.110> sticky<00:01:13.620> protein

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
well very chewy a very sticky protein

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.860 
well very chewy a very sticky protein
bar<00:01:15.950> very<00:01:16.950> dense<00:01:17.990> there<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> thin<00:01:19.920> layer<00:01:20.250> of

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
bar very dense there is a thin layer of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.380 
bar very dense there is a thin layer of
the<00:01:21.870> jelly<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.030> sure<00:01:24.270> if

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the jelly right in there I'm not sure if

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.180 
the jelly right in there I'm not sure if
the<00:01:24.510> camera<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.050> pick<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:27.380> but<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:29.010> is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
the camera can pick this up but there is

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.740 
the camera can pick this up but there is
a<00:01:29.450> tiny<00:01:30.450> layer<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.650> jelly<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.450> get<00:01:33.450> only<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
a tiny layer of the jelly I get only a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.400 
a tiny layer of the jelly I get only a
hint<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.610> dominated<00:01:36.540> by

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
hint of it it's really just dominated by

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.110 
hint of it it's really just dominated by
the<00:01:37.470> peanut<00:01:37.950> butter<00:01:38.160> so<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:38.640> love<00:01:38.910> peanut

I like the I like the way Chris those
are<00:01:51.660> pretty<00:01:51.870> good<00:01:53.090> again<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.480> not<00:01:54.990> really

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
are pretty good again it's not really

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.390 
are pretty good again it's not really
the<00:01:56.340> best<00:01:56.580> it's<00:01:56.850> okay<00:01:57.380> I'm<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.440> gonna<00:01:58.950> be

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
the best it's okay I'm not gonna be

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.040 
the best it's okay I'm not gonna be
saying<00:01:59.760> it's<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.000> horrible<00:02:00.330> taste<00:02:00.660> cuz<00:02:00.930> it's

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
saying it's a horrible taste cuz it's

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.000 
saying it's a horrible taste cuz it's
actually<00:02:01.440> quite<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.260> guess<00:02:04.470> for<00:02:04.830> my

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
actually quite good but I guess for my

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.150 
actually quite good but I guess for my
money<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.700> maybe<00:02:05.990> 350<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.410> for<00:02:08.040> this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
money this was maybe 350 or so for this

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.090 
money this was maybe 350 or so for this
bar<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:09.540> see<00:02:09.720> only<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:09.990> gram<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.440> fiber<00:02:10.800> on

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
bar and I see only one gram of fiber on

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.980 
bar and I see only one gram of fiber on
here<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> figure<00:02:11.820> there's<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.270> better

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
here I figure there's some better

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.570 
here I figure there's some better
options<00:02:13.560> nutrition<00:02:14.430> wise<00:02:14.989> as<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.470> I'd<00:02:17.310> give

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
options nutrition wise as is I'd give

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.330 
options nutrition wise as is I'd give
this<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.790> 3<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.330> 5<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.959> not<00:02:19.260> horrible<00:02:20.160> it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
this a 3 out of 5 it's not horrible it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.030 
this a 3 out of 5 it's not horrible it's
not<00:02:20.580> gonna<00:02:20.940> blow<00:02:21.150> me<00:02:21.390> away<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.770> still

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
not gonna blow me away but it's still

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.840 
not gonna blow me away but it's still
decent<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.209> is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
decent for what it is
