the mention of that and that didn't go
too<00:00:44.280> well<00:00:44.579> didn't<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.300> well<00:00:45.480> though<00:00:45.950> get

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
too well didn't go well though get

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
too well didn't go well though get
pretty<00:00:47.219> raped<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.059> sort<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> like

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

sent<00:00:49.110> my<00:00:49.230> squad<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> time<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.460> they

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
sent my squad one of the time and they

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.770 
sent my squad one of the time and they
didn't<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.039> but<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> Mike

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
didn't really make it but I'm so Mike

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
didn't really make it but I'm so Mike
theta<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.230> game<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.770> think<00:00:55.980> it'll

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
theta in this game like I think it'll

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.299 
theta in this game like I think it'll
just<00:00:56.370> affect<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> points<00:00:57.590> or<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.890> i<00:00:59.070> don't

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
just affect the points or so i don't

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
just affect the points or so i don't
think<00:00:59.460> i<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.609> actually<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
think i will actually like you know it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
think i will actually like you know it
doesn't<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> doesn't<00:01:01.199> progress<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.039> days

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
doesn't it doesn't progress the days

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.130 
doesn't it doesn't progress the days
like<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> know<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> feel<00:01:03.570> mentioned<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like you know if you feel mentioned it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920 
like you know if you feel mentioned it
won't<00:01:04.290> prepares<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> day<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.570> accent<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
probably check this like a hundred times

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.450 
probably check this like a hundred times
as<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.549> source<00:01:12.880> better<00:01:13.119> perfect

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
as a source better perfect

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.330 
as a source better perfect
but<00:01:16.090> am<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.470> doesn't<00:01:17.650> progress<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:18.010> day<00:01:18.190> like

but am this doesn't progress a day like
a<00:01:18.400> dead<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.790> original<00:01:18.880> game<00:01:19.119> so<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.479> got<00:01:19.780> me

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
a dead in the original game so I got me

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.120 
a dead in the original game so I got me
a<00:01:19.869> lil<00:01:20.049> factors<00:01:20.320> on<00:01:20.409> even<00:01:20.680> real<00:01:20.799> punishment

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
a lil factors on even real punishment

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.630 
a lil factors on even real punishment
for<00:01:21.580> any<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.110> sort<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.260> stuff<00:01:23.500> so<00:01:24.310> it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
for any of this sort of stuff so it

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.630 
for any of this sort of stuff so it
shouldn't<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.970> big<00:01:25.150> deal<00:01:25.180> look<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.490> see

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
shouldn't be a big deal look as you see

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.859 
shouldn't be a big deal look as you see
I'm<00:01:27.729> kind<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:27.909> feeling<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.420> this<00:01:28.540> game<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.750> lot

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
I'm kind of feeling and this game a lot

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:29.850 
I'm kind of feeling and this game a lot
because<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.200> corruption<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.560> pretty<00:01:29.740> high

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
because the corruption is pretty high

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.010 
because the corruption is pretty high
anyway<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:31.330> know<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.479> mean<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.720> was<00:01:31.840> trying<00:01:31.990> to
