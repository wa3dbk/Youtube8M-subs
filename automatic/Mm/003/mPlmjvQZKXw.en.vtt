00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.929 
transferred from one of the larger state
schools<00:00:17.570> in<00:00:18.570> Alabama<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.580> really<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.730> just

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
schools in Alabama and really was just

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
schools in Alabama and really was just
disappointed<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.600> my<00:00:21.720> experience<00:00:22.289> there<00:00:22.529> I

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
disappointed with my experience there I

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370 
disappointed with my experience there I
felt<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.060> was<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.240> kind<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.630> number<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
felt like I was just kind of a number it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.250 
felt like I was just kind of a number it
wasn't<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.460> person<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:29.900> really<00:00:30.900> think

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
wasn't really a person I really think

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.830 
wasn't really a person I really think
that<00:00:31.320> Nursing<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> calling<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.600> think

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
that Nursing is a calling I really think

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.750 
that Nursing is a calling I really think
that<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.829> best<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.130> Christ's

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that you know it's best to have Christ's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.970 
that you know it's best to have Christ's
heart<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> care<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.809> someone<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
heart when you care for someone and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.680 
heart when you care for someone and
that's<00:00:38.219> how<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> best<00:00:39.000> compassion

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that's how you get the best compassion

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.190 
that's how you get the best compassion
and<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:42.030> why<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> chose<00:00:42.750> Sanford

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and so that's really why I chose Sanford

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.910 
and so that's really why I chose Sanford
I<00:00:43.410> felt<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.430> could<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.420> only<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> good

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I felt like I could not only get a good

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
I felt like I could not only get a good
quality<00:00:47.730> education<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> get

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
quality education but I was going to get

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.020 
quality education but I was going to get
a<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.320> character<00:00:49.980> education<00:00:50.100> too

but you're also taught how to care to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
but you're also taught how to care to
others<00:00:53.219> not<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.670> people<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.000> yourself

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.959 
really wanted to see me succeed Sanford
has<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.600> most<00:02:00.899> high-tech<00:02:01.969> facilities

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
has one of the most high-tech facilities

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.910 
has one of the most high-tech facilities
for<00:02:03.270> us<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> practice<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.110> which<00:02:04.380> i<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.619> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
for us to practice on which i think is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.410 
for us to practice on which i think is
so<00:02:05.130> important<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> clinical

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
so important we have the clinical

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.600 
so important we have the clinical
learning<00:02:06.840> lab<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:08.009> where<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.340> practice

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
learning lab and it's where we practice

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.839 
learning lab and it's where we practice
our<00:02:09.440> basic<00:02:10.440> skills<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:11.009> nursing<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
our basic skills for nursing the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.089 
our basic skills for nursing the
simulation<00:02:12.360> really<00:02:12.629> shows<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.709> how<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> put

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
simulation really shows you how to put

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.369 
simulation really shows you how to put
it<00:02:14.160> into<00:02:14.250> practice<00:02:14.459> you're<00:02:14.819> given<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.989> scenario

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
it into practice you're given a scenario

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.320 
it into practice you're given a scenario
and<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.370> walk<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.819> what<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.270> do

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and you have to walk in what do I do

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.949 
and you have to walk in what do I do
next

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
next

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.540 
next
so<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.530> helps<00:02:19.830> pull<00:02:20.069> all<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> pieces

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
so it really helps pull all the pieces

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
so it really helps pull all the pieces
together<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.360> learned<00:02:21.629> in<00:02:21.780> class<00:02:21.930> in

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
together that you learned in class in

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.890 
together that you learned in class in
the<00:02:22.650> Learning<00:02:22.920> Labs<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.550> apply<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the Learning Labs and apply it so that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.510 
the Learning Labs and apply it so that
if<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.319> ever<00:02:25.349> see<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.739> situation<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.400> know

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
if you ever see that situation you know

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880 
if you ever see that situation you know
exactly<00:02:26.879> what<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.750> actually<00:02:28.020> see

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
exactly what to do you can actually see

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.400 
exactly what to do you can actually see
flashback<00:02:29.760> when<00:02:30.060> you're<00:02:30.209> doing<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:30.660> IV<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
flashback when you're doing your IV and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.250 
flashback when you're doing your IV and
we<00:02:31.800> did<00:02:31.950> all<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.099> our<00:02:32.220> checkups<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.879> there<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
we did all of our checkups on there and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.229 
we did all of our checkups on there and
we<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.410> felt<00:02:34.739> like<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:35.160> were<00:02:35.310> talking<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.209> a

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
we really felt like we were talking to a

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.360 
we really felt like we were talking to a
patient<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.590> when<00:02:37.769> we<00:02:37.890> were<00:02:37.950> going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.280> our

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
patient and so when we were going to our

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.490 
patient and so when we were going to our
first<00:02:38.519> clinical<00:02:39.060> day<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.300> foundations<00:02:39.900> we

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
first clinical day in foundations we

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.350 
first clinical day in foundations we
were<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.769> okay<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.519> got<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.879> we<00:02:42.060> did<00:02:42.239> this

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
were like okay we got this we did this

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.500 
were like okay we got this we did this
before<00:02:42.769> so<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.040> makes<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.400> more<00:02:44.610> relaxed

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
before so it just makes it more relaxed

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.839 
before so it just makes it more relaxed
when<00:02:45.810> you're<00:02:45.959> going<00:02:46.110> into<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.560> first<00:02:46.800> day<00:02:47.069> we

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
when you're going into that first day we

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.970 
when you're going into that first day we
go<00:02:48.060> into<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> hospital<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.260> are<00:02:49.620> able<00:02:49.800> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
go into the hospital and are able to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.130 
go into the hospital and are able to
perform<00:02:50.280> patient<00:02:50.849> care<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.300> we're

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
perform patient care and we're

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.050 
perform patient care and we're
comfortable<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:52.830> our<00:02:53.250> own<00:02:53.370> skills<00:02:53.700> because

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
comfortable with our own skills because

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.479 
comfortable with our own skills because
we've<00:02:54.239> practiced<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:54.989> many<00:02:55.200> times<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:56.160> lot

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
we've practiced so many times and a lot

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.070 
we've practiced so many times and a lot
of<00:02:56.610> schools<00:02:56.849> don't<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.330> what<00:02:57.599> we<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:57.870> here

of schools don't have what we have here

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.570 
of schools don't have what we have here
at<00:02:58.200> Sanford<00:02:58.620> I<00:03:00.920> definitely<00:03:01.920> feel<00:03:02.129> like<00:03:02.159> an

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
at Sanford I definitely feel like an

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.930 
at Sanford I definitely feel like an
item<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:03.030> Moffitt<00:03:03.420> graduate<00:03:04.409> will<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.159> highly

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
item in Moffitt graduate will be highly

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.360 
item in Moffitt graduate will be highly
sought<00:03:06.150> after<00:03:06.209> because<00:03:07.110> it's<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.860> holistic

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
sought after because it's the holistic

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.790 
sought after because it's the holistic
care<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.360> were<00:03:09.540> learning<00:03:09.989> here<00:03:10.260> we

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
care that that you were learning here we

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.240 
care that that you were learning here we
all<00:03:11.010> care<00:03:11.970> about<00:03:12.269> people<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.200> that's<00:03:13.920> one<00:03:14.129> of

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
the things that drew all of us to the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.259 
the things that drew all of us to the
field<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.190> Nursing<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:17.849> care<00:03:18.090> about<00:03:18.180> people

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
field of Nursing as we care about people

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.479 
field of Nursing as we care about people
and<00:03:18.840> not<00:03:19.409> just<00:03:19.470> our<00:03:19.769> patients<00:03:20.159> we<00:03:20.250> care<00:03:20.430> about

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
and not just our patients we care about

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.770 
and not just our patients we care about
each<00:03:20.580> other<00:03:20.849> we're<00:03:21.269> learning<00:03:21.360> about<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
each other we're learning about the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.180 
each other we're learning about the
diseases<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.319> then<00:03:22.620> we're<00:03:22.739> also<00:03:22.890> learning

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
diseases but then we're also learning

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.920 
diseases but then we're also learning
how<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.489> listen<00:03:23.909> to<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> patient<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.690> look<00:03:24.810> at

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
how to listen to the patient and look at

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.030 
how to listen to the patient and look at
the<00:03:25.019> patient<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:28.620> goes<00:03:28.830> that

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
the patient and it's just it goes that

the<00:03:29.220> teachers<00:03:29.549> go<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.819> extra<00:03:29.970> mile<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.659> make

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
the teachers go the extra mile to make

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.300 
the teachers go the extra mile to make
sure<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.080> we<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.440> bedside<00:03:32.069> manner
