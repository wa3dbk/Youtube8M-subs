00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 the news is amazing old 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.059
 gaming consoles such as mega drive or 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.650
 super nintendo still sell and much 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 almost 200 thousand units per year and the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.600
 What a nostalgia for this wave 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.750
 see why they still do both 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.750
 success 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.640
 How many of us do not remember sonic? 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.470
 mÃ¡rio megaman alex kidd and many others 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:39.270
 characters immortalized by 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:41.430
 video games and how many games last 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.940
 are launched at a rapid pace. 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 a galera cultivates and idolizes games of the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.120
 past decades 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.430
 game fanatics of any and all 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 kind of unintentionally 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.110
 bruno collects more than 30 consoles 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.289
 from the oldest to the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.690
 more modern and guarantees use all of them 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 no exception 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 I do not consider myself a collector because 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.740
 I've never had it in my head of garlic 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.030
 I'm going to collect video games, right? 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.460
 This happened a lot in the exchange for 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.869
 trunks over my mania that I do not 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.610
 I can play things, they run away a lot. 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.350
 jealous of my things then 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.299
 It turned out I had games I won. 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.580
 parents at the time I started buying and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.280
 we could not do the previous ones 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.020
 and there as a consequence of this nowadays 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 the car having all the collective consoles 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 during my life 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.990
 married and father of a daughter bruna began 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.759
 your life the game early 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 the first part of this story was 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.320
 when the three - year-old won his 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.630
 first attack on christmas 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.070
 it was love at first sight the best 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.710
 first move 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.740
 today alongside friends just like him 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.229
 fans of classic games of the 80's and 90's 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.030
 bruno keeps active a site dedicated to 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.149
 remember the old sessions and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.400
 magazines rental of games magazines 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.470
 most popular of the season and much more 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.820
 each time you play a game of 8 16 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 but it was when you grew up and searched 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.760
 reliving a little of that moment 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.910
 then it has a very emotional 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.770
 Great, I also think the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.810
 The goal of the games changed a lot. 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.520
 Nowadays you have the games and they only 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 by the cinematographic things games 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.430
 beautiful setting, beautiful and that story 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.310
 fantastic 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.660
 only when it ends does it feel like it's over 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.610
 If it was a movie, it's really playing. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.560
 That movie is over so you do not have 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.120
 same as playing again 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.030
 In ancient times games will be simpler 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.130
 and you played simple for the simple fact 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.780
 wanting to play more in the then so 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.330
 that attracts the old games is the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.700
 gameplay than the purest form that 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.510
 exists in games and play for the pleasure of 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.239
 play 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.930
 not that he is averse to more games 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.970
 new 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.130
 same because bruno also has fun 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.959
 enough with the latest releases but 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.850
 on the other hand he believes that this 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.920
 enormous evolution that happened in the world 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.290
 of video games in the last few years has 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.980
 a bit with this emotional side of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.660
 play 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.790
 today we have the consoles that you 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.640
 How to play online with face in Japan 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.769
 this is good because it gives you access to 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.360
 other cultures but you do not have any more 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.549
 that thing of a friend playing with the 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.450
 Other you do not share a couch anymore 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.040
 to play 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.959
 Today I'm a friend, it's centered on the house. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.239
 him playing and you sitting in the streets 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.459
 we are talking the headset neighbor 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.989
 but it's not the same thing you know 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.380
 experience is different you do not have 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.690
 plus the physical conviviality of the person 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.210
 for those lovers of old games 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.120
 impressive graphics and even games in 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.700
 3d does not mean that much anyway 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.710
 because among them is almost unanimous 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.410
 opinion that the classic tank 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.780
 with its 8 or 16 bits still 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.540
 a lot of people surprise a test 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.700
 of this is joy and excitement of the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:51.680
 young Luiz Henrique in front of his 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:54.020
 preserved a mega drug at age five 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.850
 The boy is already a fan of games. 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.520
 retro that despite having experienced 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.860
 most modern consoles have fun 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:07.160
 side of the father for the simple pleasure of playing 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:12.320
 exactly as it was some time ago 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.930
 I like to be part of the history of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.720
