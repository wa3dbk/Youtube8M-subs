back also another nice feature for this

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.940 
back also another nice feature for this
luxa2<00:02:35.180> laptop<00:02:36.180> lift<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.840> has<00:02:37.319> these<00:02:37.620> heat

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
luxa2 laptop lift is that has these heat

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.000 
luxa2 laptop lift is that has these heat
pipe<00:02:39.170> ventilation<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.680> guys<00:02:40.829> can<00:02:40.950> see

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
pipe ventilation as you guys can see

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.119 
pipe ventilation as you guys can see
here<00:02:41.370> at<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.819> back<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.750> has<00:02:42.900> these<00:02:43.379> hip<00:02:43.709> heat

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
here at the back it has these hip heat

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.900 
here at the back it has these hip heat
pipe<00:02:44.459> insulation<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.599> what<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.290> does<00:02:46.910> is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
pipe insulation and what this does is

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.979 
pipe insulation and what this does is
that<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:49.220> enhances<00:02:50.220> heat<00:02:51.000> dissipation<00:02:51.569> by

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
that it enhances heat dissipation by

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.410 
that it enhances heat dissipation by
providing<00:02:52.470> direct<00:02:53.310> heat<00:02:53.579> conduction<00:02:54.000> path

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
providing direct heat conduction path

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.930 
providing direct heat conduction path
between<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.379> laptops<00:02:56.010> bottom<00:02:56.879> casing<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
between the laptops bottom casing and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.009 
between the laptops bottom casing and
the<00:02:59.940> aluminum<00:03:01.010> surface<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.700> l1<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.780> what

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
the aluminum surface of the l1 so what

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.640 
the aluminum surface of the l1 so what
this<00:03:04.200> all<00:03:04.560> means<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:06.030> gives<00:03:06.090> that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
this all means is that it gives that

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.420 
this all means is that it gives that
when<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.950> laptop<00:03:08.760> heats<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.859> it<00:03:10.859> cools<00:03:11.250> down

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
when the laptop heats up it cools down

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.630 
when the laptop heats up it cools down
how<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.470> heat<00:03:13.950> ventilation

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
how it's because of the heat ventilation

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.599 
how it's because of the heat ventilation
that<00:03:15.060> they<00:03:15.269> designed<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.609> laptop

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
that they designed so that the laptop

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.050 
that they designed so that the laptop
won't<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.239> heated<00:03:18.599> as<00:03:18.780> much<00:03:19.139> as<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.680> and

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
won't be heated as much as it is and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.270 
won't be heated as much as it is and
it's<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.299> really<00:03:21.690> cool<00:03:21.959> solution<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.950> your
