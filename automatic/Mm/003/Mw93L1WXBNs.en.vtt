00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.260 
contest obviously I did when I got 7th
and<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.050> kind<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:02.640> fire<00:01:02.910> burned

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and that was kind of what my fire burned

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.000 
and that was kind of what my fire burned
out<00:01:03.420> after<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> show<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.439> put<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
out after that show because I put so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
out after that show because I put so
much<00:01:05.220> into<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.060> everything<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.540> could

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
much into it and get everything I could

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
much into it and get everything I could
but<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.740> cut<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> chase<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.700> basically

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
but it's cut to the chase here basically

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.380

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it's kind of hard when you 12 times a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.910 
it's kind of hard when you 12 times a
day<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.290> taking<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.800> know

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
day but I was taking you know

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.339 
day but I was taking you know
approximately<00:02:17.130> 20<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:17.880> use<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> growth<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.630> day<00:02:18.840> as

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
approximately 20 I use a growth a day as

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.100 
approximately 20 I use a growth a day as
far<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.680> my<00:02:20.010> steroid<00:02:20.459> cycle<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.660> back

far as my steroid cycle you know back

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.190 
far as my steroid cycle you know back
then<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:23.340> was<00:02:23.819> taking<00:02:24.180> two<00:02:24.360> grams<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.780> tests

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
then I was taking two grams of tests

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.650 
then I was taking two grams of tests
probably<00:02:25.819> six<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.910> eight<00:02:27.090> hundred<00:02:27.120> milligrams

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
probably six to eight hundred milligrams

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.370 
probably six to eight hundred milligrams
a<00:02:27.840> trend<00:02:28.310> probably<00:02:29.310> 600<00:02:29.760> milligrams<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
a trend probably 600 milligrams of

twenty I use of growth and for me
that's<00:02:42.930> that's<00:02:43.560> probably<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.160> craziest<00:02:44.430> I've

amount of muscle I put on my body was

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:52.880 
amount of muscle I put on my body was
insane

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890
