00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.639
 we are in another fundamental section of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.629
 our course where we will comment on 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.580
 practical exercises of costing this I 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.789
 I think that is the most important thing of all 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.360
 course where we teach you to use the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.030
 excel and we are putting the case and then 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.150
 We are going to show you how 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.579
 we solve so is that the first example 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.950
 that we have is an espresso lungo a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.550
 long espresso a product that can be 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.850
 sell equally in restaurants or in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.250
 coffee shops on one side I put the recipe of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.399
 another side I put the inputs and then 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.579
 let's start calculating the recipe we 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.920
 ask for a 4 oz. cup in which 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.850
 let's put 2 ounces of water and 7 to 10 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.780
 grams of coffee remember that an espresso 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 long is a drink where it is not made 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.090
 the typical espresso of 26 27 seconds 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.500
 but let it run a little more 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.569
 the water and we almost do not fill the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.389
 rate but to three quarters plus or minus the 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:18.840
 rate and for this we require the 

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:21.389
 water supplies good coffee in the case of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.749
 water I put it for garrafón 25 pesos for 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:27.689
 garrafón a liter of 34 ounces we have 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.909
 also coffee the disposable cup in 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.409
 cans and lid if we 're going to give it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.590
 to take the napkin the remover 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.250
 sugar and milk 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.369
 these are for a service that is 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.180
 had to carry what you could 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.600
 to do is to do 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.090
 let's say two types of products in the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.910
 system to put express long to carry 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.440
 and then you know that the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:03.370
 cost of disposables and put express 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.920
 long let's say to take here then 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.679
 you in your internal control already know 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.110
 how many glasses were wasted and 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.420
 how many glasses if they were used I say 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.570
 imagine yourself in a coffee shop where you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.610
 They have 70-80 clients daily simple and 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.239
 you simply can not take control 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.850
 of each little thing so is that in a 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.580
 We are going to watch the video of how 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.130
 this is solved 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.930
 before we start using our 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.780
 excel to solve the exercise of 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.150
 I express lungo what I want to tell you 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.670
 is that there is a video where I give a 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.050
 introduction to excel in that video of 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.990
 introduction to excel you will know 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.870
 what are the parts from the cover 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.760
 the cost of the inputs how to put the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.390
 cost of the supplies that are here 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.280
 right here the hot drinks how 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.400
 use cold drinks alcohol drinks 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.590
 food and the prising of the competition 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.800
 so if you have not seen that video in 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.490
 this moment has to do now the 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.990
 express lungo or espresso long and 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.990
 we would have to go to hot drinks 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.990
