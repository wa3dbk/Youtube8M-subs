00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
but I'll just get started on the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.850 
but I'll just get started on the
unboxing<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.479> first<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:14.330> wheel

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
unboxing so first of all we have a wheel

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
unboxing so first of all we have a wheel
which<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> Saavik<00:01:17.400> wheel<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.509> won't

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
which is a Saavik wheel which they won't

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.749 
which is a Saavik wheel which they won't
be<00:01:18.840> using<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> silent<00:01:20.460> spinner

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
be using because I have a silent spinner

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.800 
be using because I have a silent spinner
I<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.990> down<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:25.610> okay<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.670> next<00:01:27.509> thing

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
I put that down there okay so next thing

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
I put that down there okay so next thing
is<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> levels<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is we have a one of the levels like a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.219 
is we have a one of the levels like a
shelf<00:01:30.780> thing<00:01:33.110> just<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> side<00:01:35.990> comes<00:01:36.990> with

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
shelf thing just to the side comes with

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
shelf thing just to the side comes with
two<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:38.009> huts<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.490> pink<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> green

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
two little huts a pink one and a green

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.920 
two little huts a pink one and a green
one<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:46.850> think<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.600> call<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
one I think this is what they call the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
one I think this is what they call the
toboggan<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.680> basically<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.610> ladder

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
toboggan but basically it's a ladder

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.419 
toboggan but basically it's a ladder
further<00:01:51.600> HAP<00:01:51.840> steady<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> there

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.870 

it<00:01:56.670> has<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:58.009> that's<00:01:59.009> part<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.429> penthouse

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it has a that's part of the penthouse

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.569 
it has a that's part of the penthouse
which<00:02:00.329> goes<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.630> top<00:02:00.929> of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> cage<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.399> this

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
which goes on top of the cage and this

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.590 
which goes on top of the cage and this
is<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:03.619> bottom<00:02:04.619> part<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.939> penthouse<00:02:06.329> so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

in here we have the blue base of the

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:20.350 
in here we have the blue base of the
cage<00:05:10.220> which<00:05:10.880> is<00:05:16.150> 80<00:05:17.150> centimeters<00:05:17.870> by<00:05:19.360> 50

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360

cage which is 80 centimeters by 50
centimeters<00:05:21.230> long<00:05:21.740> so<00:05:22.400> it's<00:05:22.520> 80<00:05:22.730> centimeters

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
centimeters long so it's 80 centimeters

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.110 
centimeters long so it's 80 centimeters
long<00:05:23.390> by<00:05:23.420> 50<00:05:23.900> wide<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.410> then<00:05:24.980> in<00:05:25.310> here<00:05:25.580> we<00:05:25.790> just
