00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.889
 today we are going to make another video like mones 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.630
 ferrero rocher I promise that the one of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.670
 next week will not be next to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.460
 better I put another one because the effect 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.420
 total in a sweet table is fantastic 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.420
 look at a picture 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.600
 is what we are going to do is the daily top 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.940
 or the little tree of chocolates for that 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.010
 we need a pot the pot and I 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.380
 they buy and that is a normal pot 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.540
 one of mud what you want you go to 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.580
 need also a stick this is going to be 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.040
 the mast let's say our little tree the 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.600
 this trunk 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.760
 I buy it in the bazaar that is here 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.830
 next but I'm sure they have it in 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.750
 any craft store this the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.540
 that I buy come from five to five or 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.000
 something like that we're going to need something too 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.280
 that makes the stick stay fixed in the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.350
 pot for me I've used dough for that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.790
 modeling there are people who use cement but 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.800
 I do not think you need to use those 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.350
 things with a little bit of modeling mass we 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.300
 if the flowerpot is not golden too 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.729
 we're going to need golden paint in 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.119
 spray and we will use of course 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.850
 I have used 45 chocolates for the 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.880
 ball and 15 to cover what was the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.860
 pot, by the way, do not throw away the boxes 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.380
 chocolates because with the safe boxes that 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.960
 we do more things to notice these are the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.610
 tapas then with the tapas in our 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.290
 craft channel we're going to 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.290
 a super cool craft 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.180
 Well, we started painting with spray 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.030
 you can also paint with normal paint 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.759
 the pots that we are going to use we paint what 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.789
 which is the lateral part and now we paint 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.439
 the top part and a bit the part 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.549
 first of the part of inside that is what 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.380
 only one that is going to see is not necessary 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.299
 paint everything perfect 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.520
 we let them stay a bit and now 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.110
 you see we put modeling dough and there 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.110
 we put our stick 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.850
 that mass modeling this carioca but 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.950
 you can use any other brand is 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.620
 a mass for use as if clay gives 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.929
 any thing like that we put in 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.420
 the bottom part of the pot and there 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.610
 let's click on our stick 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.099
 we do it first so that's how 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.290
 We dry a little good now let's 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.630
 catch a ball this ball is the same 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.510
 size than the bouquet that we made the other 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.060
 day that is it has a diameter of 10 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.920
 centimeters and we form it with paper of 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 aluminum in this case no matter what it is 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.140
 silver because it is not seen now in the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.730
 ball we're going to try to nail the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.319
 stick that we have as it is almost impossible 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.140
 what we are going to do is a hole 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.840
 previous with a beige pencil with a pencil 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.069
 we puncture our ball and once 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.030
 we have already done a bit of the hole 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.800
 we put the stick and it is already we have the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.200
 stick stuck now we take it out to be able 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.989
 work well and start putting in it 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.519
 the chocolates on the ball to put the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.140
 chocolates this time I'm going to remove the 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.290
 brown capsules because there is more 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.120
 pretty I just have to go using it with the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.950
 hot and hitting chocolates one at 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.230
 side of the other then we go there until 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.230
 that we have them all 45 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.430
 as I put chocolates on one side 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.440
 is weighing more on that side then 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.630
 you see already left him well supported to continue 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.459
 I already have my ball, I have a couple of 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.040
 chocolates and you're done 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.010
 Nothing I put them and now what I'm going to 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.410
 to do is decorate the stick a little before 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.730
 of that fix to be stable so 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.459
 what you have to do is put a little more 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.200
 of dough to model in the first one that 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.970
 I've already done a little bit of 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.660
 hole and that's going to come well so that 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.760
 then be harder you see in the mass and 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.700
 I say on the stick I will put then what is 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.210
 my ball of chocolates but now what 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.850
 I'm going to do is decorate that stick for that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.950
 look, I used to keep like 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.490
 all hands I used wasit tape 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.650
 tape you can use ribbon of flowers what 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.919
 you want or paint it to me I thought 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.770
 this more comfortable because I take the tape the 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.270
 I put around the stick and now what 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.680
 I'm going to do is put some cola 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.200
 hot on the ends before 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.550
 paste it before hitting the ball with the 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.710
 chocolates and before putting my stick in what 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.520
 which is the mass of modeling and with this 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.960
 I will stay 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.960
 sufficiently rigid 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.490
 Well, I'm almost finished, you see 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.169
 is there the top part now I'm going to 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.409
 fill the bottom with a little 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.180
 foil actually then 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.780
 almost not seen but good if you have left 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.530
 some gap 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.470
 I fill it and now and once I 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.090
 I have all reindeer I will put there bonbons this 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.889
 Once I leave capsule but could 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.490
 have removed the capsule as nothing 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.490
 I leave watching it 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.220
 I put in total down there 15 is me 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.650
 helping chris to make it faster 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.900
 well then I put 15 capsules and has 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.090
 said and now I can only do one 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.490
 I have done it in a bond that 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.970
 I have gold I have made a ribbon and I am going to 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.760
