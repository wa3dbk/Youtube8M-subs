00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:16.700
 here again as it is before by the way 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.550
 The curtain rod fell off so cold 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.489
 was a bit stupid but I have 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.090
 not bought a glue so the 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.090
 small 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.030
 For comparison, this is the first layer 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.129
 triesenberg and that's white now 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.500
 is still a good layer 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.899
 right away, everything was beautiful and it was 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.660
 it looks like it has nothing 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.699
 changed but we have with tessin 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.730
 stopped 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.949
 the kernels with mitra sweet then I have 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.809
 just just the super super nice 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.519
 get complete tesa as a gift 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.140
 I came from with the whole lama 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.680
 business cards and stickers too 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.299
 asked and also my ideas 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.430
 how do i pack in the cup cake? 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.979
 so that after all 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 that looks like it is here now with it 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.760
 milk jug and the white tiles i 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.439
 sped out 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.960
 So I think that leaves the whole room 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.150
 somehow much quieter bit bigger 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.689
 and above all, quite neat 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.689
 Act 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.700
 yes I find doing down and writes 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.530
 Once in the comments like you 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 I like the next time I think 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.650
 no more videos will be loaded 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.060
 come because much more than pictures 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.890
 he probably will not hang up 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 More happen and they were that too 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.610
 still a little empty there I hang there 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.470
 my prince and my bags still 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.360
 I hang in the three frames 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.250
 and when I go with that too 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 this is where the sales counter is 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.050
 That's it, then we'll see each other next 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.050
 Video
