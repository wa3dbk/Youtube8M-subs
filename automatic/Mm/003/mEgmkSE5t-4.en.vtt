 and install the sims 3 versions 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.249
 globetrotter good what we need is 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.709
 have installed the sims 3 and these two 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.530
 programs very easy to download the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.060
 engine and the one before I'll leave you 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.700
 also the links in the description of 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.250
 good video when you already have these two 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.480
 installed programs we go to another link 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.990
 that I'll leave it in the description of 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.349
 video for the expansion good as you see 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.670
 has the size is 5.7 gigabytes and 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.629
 well, it does not weigh much, it's loading unloaded 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.429
 autorun environment we give you and youtube 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.640
 I already have it locked up, it's worth nothing 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.470
 approximately or more 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.720
 ten hours more or less to it 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 taken longer because I downloaded from 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.480
 all these four followed is worth when 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.489
 you have downloaded completely you give 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.000
 to right click there is a folder 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.000
 Container 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 that will open up, this is what I already 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.259
 unzipped the account file but yes 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.750
 as you will not have it decompressed we give 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.890
 two clicks to the first file always the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.360
 first it's worth two clicks 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.950
 we wait for them to open up good when 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:26.090
 Bones open the wing tram let's go to this 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.450
 file and we extract it here is worth as 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.400
 you see 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.300
 I'm not going to do it, I already have it 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.890
 ok if this has not been moved to the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.740
 folder is valid so that it stays in that 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.520
 folder will not take long when 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:46.210
 you have two clicks on the iso file 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.210
 so you can open a tour 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.330
 to mount the image will come out 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.240
 this 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.140
 we hope the post will come out this as 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.180
 when you put a CD because that same thing I do not 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.580
 I can execute it because as I already have it 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.430
 installed then I would not be worth it is 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.280
 very easy you give to run auto room 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.979
 you will be sure that he asks you for a 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.160
 update is very easy to update if 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.270
 it will be about five minutes so if 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.280
 do you have a problem with the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.140
 update you tell me for a message 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.750
 Private month and it's exactly what you 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.280
 I'll try to fix, it's worth, if not 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.100
 have no problem then forward 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.850
 later when when I ask for the serial 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:34.530
 very attentive let's team 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:38.130
 you give here right click april we're going to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.220
 create and at r ls3 w 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.750
 we give the general twice and copy is 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.640
 the serial that o is exposed is worth the copy 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.420
 is and is already installed is when already 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.150
 you have completely installed 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.650
 do not close this crack folder because 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.300
 you are going to have to copy these two 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.410
 records 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.810
 we copy it let's set it apart 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.810
 program files 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.810
 electronic 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.129

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.800

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.989
 I have installed and it would be silly 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.160
 when you have copied and pasted it 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.970
 you already have the game you can already 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.160
