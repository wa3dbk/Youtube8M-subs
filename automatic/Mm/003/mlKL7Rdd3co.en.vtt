how to protect your concrete whether

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.470 
how to protect your concrete whether
it's<00:00:15.349> pavers<00:00:15.860> or<00:00:16.189> plain<00:00:16.580> concrete<00:00:17.119> like<00:00:17.300> I

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
it's pavers or plain concrete like I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.480 
it's pavers or plain concrete like I
have<00:00:17.689> here<00:00:18.050> with<00:00:18.500> me<00:00:18.529> is<00:00:18.770> rich<00:00:18.949> girl<00:00:19.220> he's<00:00:19.460> with

quikrete and rich welcome number one
number<00:00:22.340> two<00:00:22.520> this<00:00:22.939> is<00:00:23.000> a<00:00:23.150> slab<00:00:23.570> very<00:00:24.410> typical

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
number two this is a slab very typical

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.859 
number two this is a slab very typical
right<00:00:25.310> by<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.550> street<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.390> about<00:00:26.570> eight

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
right by the street it's about eight

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.529 
right by the street it's about eight
years<00:00:27.199> old<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:27.769> I<00:00:28.519> already<00:00:29.000> notice<00:00:29.510> that

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
years old and I already notice that

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.779 
years old and I already notice that
there's<00:00:30.019> some<00:00:30.199> deterioration<00:00:30.650> taking<00:00:31.519> place

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
there's some deterioration taking place

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.060 
there's some deterioration taking place
in<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.269> concrete<00:00:32.689> I'm<00:00:33.199> assuming<00:00:33.830> it's<00:00:33.949> from

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
in the concrete I'm assuming it's from

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.620 
in the concrete I'm assuming it's from
the<00:00:34.280> salt<00:00:34.550> that's<00:00:34.760> getting<00:00:35.090> kicked<00:00:35.329> up<00:00:35.510> is

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
the salt that's getting kicked up is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.270 
the salt that's getting kicked up is
that<00:00:35.719> true<00:00:35.930> that's<00:00:36.230> exactly<00:00:36.680> what's<00:00:36.860> happened

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
that true that's exactly what's happened

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.610 
that true that's exactly what's happened
because<00:00:37.700> over<00:00:38.180> those<00:00:38.329> past<00:00:38.930> years<00:00:39.230> we've<00:00:39.410> had

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
because over those past years we've had

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.920 
because over those past years we've had
some<00:00:39.649> bad<00:00:40.340> weather<00:00:40.550> sure<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:41.360> any<00:00:41.629> time<00:00:41.899> a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
some bad weather sure and any time a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.600 
some bad weather sure and any time a
salt<00:00:42.440> truck<00:00:42.559> comes<00:00:42.860> along<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.129> little<00:00:43.399> bit<00:00:43.520> of

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
salt truck comes along a little bit of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.400 
salt truck comes along a little bit of
residue<00:00:43.879> either<00:00:43.969> comes<00:00:44.480> off<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.870> trucks<00:00:45.140> or

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
residue either comes off the trucks or

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.260 
residue either comes off the trucks or
actually<00:00:46.010> comes<00:00:46.219> off<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.489> your<00:00:46.640> cars<00:00:46.969> as<00:00:47.239> you

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
actually comes off of your cars as you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.360 
actually comes off of your cars as you
pull<00:00:47.539> into<00:00:47.750> your<00:00:47.840> driveway<00:00:47.960> now<00:00:48.739> if<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.100> were

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
pull into your driveway now if this were

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.299 
pull into your driveway now if this were
a<00:00:50.030> little<00:00:50.480> worse<00:00:50.780> than<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.200> is<00:00:51.350> right<00:00:51.559> now<00:00:51.770> we'd

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
a little worse than it is right now we'd

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.639 
a little worse than it is right now we'd
be<00:00:52.460> doing<00:00:52.730> some<00:00:52.910> major<00:00:53.090> patching<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.379> I<00:00:54.410> think

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
be doing some major patching but I think

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.170 
be doing some major patching but I think
I'm<00:00:54.739> going<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:54.949> avoid<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.370> patching<00:00:55.879> but<00:00:56.059> I

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
I'm going to avoid the patching but I

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.720 
I'm going to avoid the patching but I
want<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.629> seal<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:57.050> because<00:00:57.320> well<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.309> tell<00:00:58.579> me

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
want to seal it because well you tell me

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.520

why<00:00:59.000> do<00:00:59.059> I<00:00:59.239> need<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.570> seal<00:00:59.809> this<00:00:59.989> well<00:01:00.289> there's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
why do I need to seal this well there's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.020 
why do I need to seal this well there's
a<00:01:00.620> lot<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.920> reasons<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.309> need<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.670> seal<00:01:01.850> it

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
a lot of reasons you need to seal it

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.580 
a lot of reasons you need to seal it
number<00:01:02.270> one<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:02.629> want<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.930> protect<00:01:03.500> the

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
number one you want to protect the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.499 
number one you want to protect the
integrity<00:01:03.829> of<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.220> concrete<00:01:04.789> okay<00:01:04.970> all<00:01:05.330> right

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
integrity of the concrete okay all right

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:06.910 
integrity of the concrete okay all right
this<00:01:05.660> is<00:01:05.780> going<00:01:05.899> to<00:01:05.990> make<00:01:06.110> your<00:01:06.260> concrete<00:01:06.560> last

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
this is going to make your concrete last

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.260 
this is going to make your concrete last
a<00:01:07.100> lot<00:01:07.250> longer<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.670> want<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.970> have<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.150> replace

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
a lot longer you want to have to replace

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.510 
a lot longer you want to have to replace
it<00:01:08.659> as<00:01:08.780> quickly<00:01:09.020> okay<00:01:09.590> all<00:01:09.770> right<00:01:09.950> also<00:01:10.189> you've

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
it as quickly okay all right also you've

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.700 
it as quickly okay all right also you've
got<00:01:10.549> worries<00:01:11.150> about<00:01:11.299> gasoline<00:01:11.930> stains<00:01:12.439> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
got worries about gasoline stains and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.920 
got worries about gasoline stains and
oil<00:01:12.890> stains<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.760> residue<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.630> really

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
oil stains and residue that you really

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.960 
oil stains and residue that you really
don't<00:01:15.049> even<00:01:15.619> like<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.860> salt<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.670> what<00:01:16.850> you

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
don't even like the salt so what you

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.370 
don't even like the salt so what you
want<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.240> do<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.600> want<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.840> take<00:01:17.990> care<00:01:18.259> of

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
want to do is you want to take care of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.710 
want to do is you want to take care of
this<00:01:18.500> as<00:01:18.860> quickly<00:01:19.280> as<00:01:19.549> possible<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:20.360> that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
this as quickly as possible so that

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.570 
this as quickly as possible so that
doesn't<00:01:20.930> get<00:01:21.080> any<00:01:21.259> worse<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.890> salty<00:01:22.310> brine

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
doesn't get any worse so the salty brine

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.429 
doesn't get any worse so the salty brine
solution<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.479> actually<00:01:23.630> penetrating<00:01:24.380> the

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
solution is actually penetrating the

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.810 
solution is actually penetrating the
concrete<00:01:24.890> that's<00:01:25.009> what's<00:01:25.220> causing<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.580> lot<00:01:25.729> of

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
concrete that's what's causing a lot of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.480 
concrete that's what's causing a lot of
this<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.090> tear<00:01:26.299> yes<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.530> here's<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.979> little<00:01:28.280> test

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
this to tear yes so here's a little test

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.039 
this to tear yes so here's a little test
I'll<00:01:28.790> do<00:01:28.939> this<00:01:29.150> now<00:01:29.390> I'll<00:01:29.509> let<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:29.780> tell<00:01:29.930> me

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
I'll do this now I'll let you tell me

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.600 
I'll do this now I'll let you tell me
about<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.380> different<00:01:30.740> types<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.100> sealer<00:01:31.460> if

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
about the different types of sealer if

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.819

it<00:01:45.110> soaks<00:01:45.320> in<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.740> means<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.520> can<00:01:46.820> be<00:01:46.970> sealed

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
it soaks in that means it can be sealed

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.330 
it soaks in that means it can be sealed

so<00:03:03.770> no<00:03:04.040> need<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.580> use<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.820> pressure<00:03:05.150> washer<00:03:05.420> any

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
so no need to use a pressure washer any

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.910 
so no need to use a pressure washer any
not<00:03:06.140> at<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.410> point

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
not at this point

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.350 
not at this point
okay<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> second<00:03:07.670> choice<00:03:07.790> would<00:03:08.060> be<00:03:08.150> just

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
okay the second choice would be just

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.540 
okay the second choice would be just
like<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> regular<00:03:08.750> trisodium<00:03:09.440> phosphate<00:03:09.890> okay

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
like a regular trisodium phosphate okay

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.640 
like a regular trisodium phosphate okay

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.530 
brush and the purpose of back brushing
is<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.950> doesn't<00:03:52.250> doesn't<00:03:53.030> pop<00:03:53.209> and

is so that so it doesn't doesn't pop and

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.270 
is so that so it doesn't doesn't pop and
and<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.050> other<00:03:54.200> thing<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.860> want<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.130> make

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
and the other thing is you want to make

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.240 
and the other thing is you want to make
sure<00:03:55.550> that<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:56.690> going<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.260> absorb<00:03:57.500> into<00:03:58.070> the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
sure that it's going to absorb into the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.190 
sure that it's going to absorb into the
concrete<00:03:58.730> there's<00:03:59.000> no<00:03:59.209> residue<00:03:59.600> left<00:03:59.870> on<00:04:00.050> the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
concrete there's no residue left on the

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.840 
concrete there's no residue left on the
top<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.770> tank<00:04:00.980> sprayer<00:04:01.160> kind<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.520> gets<00:04:01.700> it

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
top so the tank sprayer kind of gets it

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.160 
top so the tank sprayer kind of gets it
on<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.180> then<00:04:02.270> we're<00:04:02.420> back<00:04:02.450> brushing<00:04:03.020> it<00:04:03.110> to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
on and then we're back brushing it to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.630 
on and then we're back brushing it to
really<00:04:03.440> force<00:04:03.650> right<00:04:03.890> on<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.250> countries

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
really force right on in the countries

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.580 
really force right on in the countries
let's<00:04:05.060> step<00:04:05.360> over<00:04:05.540> here<00:04:05.900> because<00:04:06.200> we've<00:04:06.380> got

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
let's step over here because we've got

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.710 
let's step over here because we've got
another<00:04:06.830> area<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.970> lot<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.330> folks<00:04:08.510> have

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
another area that a lot of folks have

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.230 
another area that a lot of folks have
now<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.140> that's<00:04:09.260> stamped<00:04:10.220> concrete<00:04:10.520> you

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
now and that's stamped concrete you

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.600 
now and that's stamped concrete you
talked<00:04:11.540> about<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:12.140> wet<00:04:12.620> look<00:04:12.860> with<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.250> stamped

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
talked about a wet look with the stamped

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.790 
talked about a wet look with the stamped
concrete<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:14.239> guess<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.720> would<00:04:14.840> be<00:04:14.870> ideal<00:04:15.170> for

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
concrete I guess that would be ideal for

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.349 
concrete I guess that would be ideal for
something<00:04:16.220> like<00:04:16.340> stamped<00:04:16.669> concrete<00:04:16.820> that's

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
something like stamped concrete that's

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.270 
something like stamped concrete that's

what people prefer with stamped concrete

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.820
