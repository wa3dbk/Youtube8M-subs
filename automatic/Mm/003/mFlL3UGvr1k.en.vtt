soldiers to somewhere and stuff um yeah
so<00:00:29.099> let's<00:00:30.060> start<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.689> back<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:32.690> work<00:00:33.690> our

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so let's start at the back and work our

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.569 
so let's start at the back and work our
way<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.170> fridge<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.680> at<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> back<00:00:35.130> there's<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
way the fridge so at the back there's a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.080 
way the fridge so at the back there's a
ladder<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.840> go<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> back<00:00:37.820> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> back

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
ladder to go up in the back in the back

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.430 
ladder to go up in the back in the back
I'm<00:00:40.020> sure<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.770> fit<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.780> four<00:00:42.780> people

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440

smaller tracks that most people use for

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
smaller tracks that most people use for
you<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.140> they're<00:01:16.740> half<00:01:17.070> tracks<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.880> their

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you know they're half tracks and their

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.219 
you know they're half tracks and their
tanks<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.200> stuff<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> yeah<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> just

there yeah so I'm here it's um you know

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.249 
there yeah so I'm here it's um you know
half<00:01:52.290> tracks<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.860> usually<00:01:53.520> really

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
half tracks are usually really

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.830 
half tracks are usually really
aerodynamic<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> front<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.719> put

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
aerodynamic at the front so I just put

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
aerodynamic at the front so I just put
some<00:01:58.610> no<00:01:59.610> curved<00:02:00.030> or<00:02:00.439> no

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.050 

you<00:02:06.700> know<00:02:06.820> um<00:02:07.030> angled<00:02:07.900> bricks<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.910> you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
you know um angled bricks and then you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.680 
you know um angled bricks and then you
know<00:02:10.149> something<00:02:10.990> later<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:12.300> do<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:13.570> with

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
know something later I do that with

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.930 
know something later I do that with
feels<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.530> make<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.100> um<00:02:17.130> yeah<00:02:18.900> then<00:02:20.940> like

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
feels that I make and um yeah then like

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.760 
feels that I make and um yeah then like
I<00:02:22.030> was<00:02:22.150> gonna<00:02:22.330> put<00:02:22.630> one<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.200> those<00:02:23.290> hooks

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
I was gonna put one of those hooks

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.500 
I was gonna put one of those hooks
because<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.430> know<00:02:24.550> half-tracks<00:02:25.030> always<00:02:25.300> have

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
because you know half-tracks always have

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.860 
because you know half-tracks always have
these<00:02:26.290> tools<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.130> stuff<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.090> sometimes

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
these tools and stuff and like sometimes

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.770 
these tools and stuff and like sometimes
I<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.440> hook<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:30.150> some<00:02:31.150> reason<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.570> don't

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
I have the hook here some reason I don't

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.600 
I have the hook here some reason I don't
know<00:02:31.959> why<00:02:32.050> but<00:02:33.030> most<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.360> them<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.590> yeah<00:02:36.430> they

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
know why but most of them so yeah they

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.860 
know why but most of them so yeah they
also<00:02:36.730> have<00:02:36.940> shovels<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.690> put<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.050> shovel<00:02:38.260> here

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
also have shovels so I put a shovel here

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
also have shovels so I put a shovel here
yeah<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.440> they<00:02:41.739> have<00:02:41.770> shovels<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:42.459> like

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
yeah I think they have shovels for like

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.220 
yeah I think they have shovels for like
if<00:02:42.760> they<00:02:42.940> need<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.180> get<00:02:43.420> out<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.810> build<00:02:44.110> a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
if they need to get out and build a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.430 
if they need to get out and build a
trench<00:02:44.560> or<00:02:44.800> something<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.489> don't<00:02:45.910> know<00:02:46.800> and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
trench or something I don't know and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.110 
trench or something I don't know and
yeah<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.590> pretty<00:02:50.739> much<00:02:51.010> my<00:02:51.310> world<00:02:51.760> war<00:02:51.940> two

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
yeah that's pretty much my world war two

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.690 
yeah that's pretty much my world war two
half<00:02:52.360> track<00:02:52.690> um<00:02:53.670> yeah<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:56.760> let's<00:02:57.760> about<00:02:58.360> it
