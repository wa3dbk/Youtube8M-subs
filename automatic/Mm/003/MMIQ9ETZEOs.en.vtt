Roberts University it's been
particularly<00:00:35.480> interesting<00:00:36.079> as<00:00:36.230> an<00:00:36.350> actor

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
particularly interesting as an actor

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.380 
particularly interesting as an actor
recommend<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:37.309> because<00:00:38.090> especially

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
recommend this because especially

studying<00:00:39.079> we<00:00:39.379> work<00:00:39.649> a<00:00:39.800> lot<00:00:40.270> off<00:00:41.270> of<00:00:41.329> a<00:00:41.600> partner

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
studying we work a lot off of a partner

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.110 
studying we work a lot off of a partner
and<00:00:42.290> we<00:00:42.980> really<00:00:43.310> should<00:00:43.460> be<00:00:43.489> like<00:00:43.670> strive<00:00:43.940> to

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
and we really should be like strive to

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.120 
and we really should be like strive to
find<00:00:44.270> a<00:00:44.570> truth<00:00:44.900> with<00:00:45.170> another<00:00:45.500> partner<00:00:45.920> on

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
find a truth with another partner on

find a truth with another partner on
state<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:46.850> working<00:00:47.210> with<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.360> robot<00:00:47.810> who's

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
state and so working with a robot who's

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.960 
state and so working with a robot who's
not<00:00:48.140> necessarily<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.800> most<00:00:48.950> humanoid<00:00:49.579> robot

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
not necessarily the most humanoid robot

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.729 
not necessarily the most humanoid robot
out<00:00:50.120> there<00:00:50.390> it's<00:00:50.720> been<00:00:51.260> interesting<00:00:51.500> to

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
out there it's been interesting to

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.180 
out there it's been interesting to
discover<00:00:52.100> what<00:00:52.840> impulses<00:00:53.840> like<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.800> reaction

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
discover what impulses like a reaction

discover what impulses like a reaction
in<00:00:55.610> me<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.090> like<00:00:56.300> how<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:56.750> how<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:56.960> play<00:00:57.350> that

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
in me and like how and how to play that

the<00:01:21.079> director<00:01:21.439> asked<00:01:21.740> me<00:01:21.770> we've<00:01:22.159> worked

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
the director asked me we've worked

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.620 
the director asked me we've worked
together<00:01:22.490> on<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.819> number<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.090> other<00:01:23.240> projects

so<00:01:23.929> interesting<00:01:24.499> and<00:01:24.649> I<00:01:24.740> had<00:01:24.829> no<00:01:25.039> idea<00:01:25.340> what<00:01:25.520> to

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
so interesting and I had no idea what to

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.760 
so interesting and I had no idea what to
expect<00:01:26.029> I<00:01:26.359> was<00:01:26.569> very<00:01:26.779> very<00:01:26.959> excited<00:01:27.139> bigger

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
expect I was very very excited bigger

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.260 
expect I was very very excited bigger
surprises<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.490> thought<00:01:28.819> there<00:01:28.909> would<00:01:28.999> be<00:01:29.029> less

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
surprises I thought there would be less

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.149 
surprises I thought there would be less
human<00:01:29.659> interaction<00:01:30.139> in<00:01:30.380> building<00:01:30.799> her

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
human interaction in building her

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.739 
human interaction in building her
because<00:01:31.490> there's<00:01:31.639> me<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.999> robot<00:01:32.299> instead<00:01:32.539> of<00:01:32.659> a

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
because there's me a robot instead of a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:33.879 
because there's me a robot instead of a
human<00:01:33.049> actor<00:01:33.289> but<00:01:33.409> actually<00:01:33.679> there's<00:01:33.829> been

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
human actor but actually there's been

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.739 
human actor but actually there's been
more<00:01:34.219> human<00:01:34.609> interaction<00:01:35.119> based<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:35.600> all<00:01:35.659> the

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
more human interaction based on all the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.149 
more human interaction based on all the
roboticists<00:01:36.109> who<00:01:36.409> have<00:01:36.499> helped<00:01:36.859> with<00:01:36.979> him

the<00:02:30.420> lab<00:02:30.569> teams<00:02:30.840> assume<00:02:31.319> that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the lab teams assume that

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.920 
the lab teams assume that
so<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.849> roboticist<00:02:33.239> ended<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.540> assume<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
so the roboticist ended to assume that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.390 
so the roboticist ended to assume that
like<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.079> gesture<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.680> carry<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.980> specific

examine now the narratives of just
really<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> daily<00:03:16.680> life<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:18.060> think<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.810> the

really a daily life and I think that the

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.530 
really a daily life and I think that the
drama<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.940> taking<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.239> extreme

where<00:03:21.870> it's<00:03:21.989> explicitly<00:03:22.819> about<00:03:23.819> storytelling

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
where it's explicitly about storytelling

with<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> fixed<00:03:25.139> text<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.889> sort<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> takes

with a fixed text and it sort of takes

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.860 
with a fixed text and it sort of takes
all<00:03:26.700> those<00:03:26.849> elements<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.419> pushes<00:03:27.660> them<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
all those elements and pushes them to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.330 
all those elements and pushes them to
one<00:03:27.989> level<00:03:28.169> but<00:03:28.769> if<00:03:28.859> we<00:03:28.919> can<00:03:29.010> take<00:03:29.130> any<00:03:29.250> of

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
one level but if we can take any of

one level but if we can take any of
those<00:03:29.400> elements<00:03:29.669> of<00:03:29.819> storytelling<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.480> work

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630

them<00:03:30.780> back<00:03:30.930> into<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.769> way<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.010> herb

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
them back into just the way that herb

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.680 
them back into just the way that herb
approaches<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.609> person<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> kitchen<00:03:33.510> or

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
approaches a person in the kitchen or

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.270 
approaches a person in the kitchen or
the<00:03:33.720> hallway<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.440> think<00:03:34.829> that'll<00:03:35.069> be<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.160> great

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
