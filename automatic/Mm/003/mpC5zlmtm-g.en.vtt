00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
put a piece of paper on fire and put it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
put a piece of paper on fire and put it
in<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> bottle<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:55.320> we're<00:00:55.440> gonna

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in the bottle and then what we're gonna

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.689 
in the bottle and then what we're gonna
do<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.100> put<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.590> molecules<00:00:58.590> will<00:00:58.859> separate

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
do is put the molecules will separate

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.849 
do is put the molecules will separate
and<00:00:59.910> let<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.420> far<00:01:00.690> away<00:01:00.780> from<00:01:00.930> each<00:01:01.170> other<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and let go far away from each other and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
and let go far away from each other and
then<00:01:02.039> once<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.370> fill<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.120> egg

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
then once we fill it up with this egg

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.950 
then once we fill it up with this egg
and<00:01:03.949> it'll<00:01:04.949> close<00:01:05.489> off<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.659> air<00:01:06.780> will

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and it'll close off so all the air will

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
and it'll close off so all the air will
get<00:01:07.080> cooler<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> air

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
get cooler in there and so all the air

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
get cooler in there and so all the air
will<00:01:09.180> push<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.560> we'll

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
will push it down that's out here we'll

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.820 
will push it down that's out here we'll
push<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:11.430> into<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> bottle<00:01:12.350> now<00:01:13.350> not

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
bottle this time all right so we can do

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.490 
bottle this time all right so we can do
the<00:02:28.120> same<00:02:28.300> exact<00:02:28.660> thing<00:02:28.720> but<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.110> egg<00:02:29.260> is

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the same exact thing but the egg is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.990 
the same exact thing but the egg is
gonna<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.800> too<00:02:29.980> big<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> juice<00:02:30.550> bottle<00:02:30.850> so

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
gonna be too big for the juice bottle so

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.199 
gonna be too big for the juice bottle so
that's<00:02:31.180> why<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:32.050> have<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.739> water<00:02:33.550> balloon<00:02:33.940> all

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
that's why we have the water balloon all

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.270 
that's why we have the water balloon all
right<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:34.810> give<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> little<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.650> perfect

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
right just give it a little is perfect

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
so now if it breaks this might be a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.690
