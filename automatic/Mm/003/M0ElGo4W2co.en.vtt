00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
seedlings so we have here our broccolis

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.860 
seedlings so we have here our broccolis
plants<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.730> saw<00:00:08.880> about<00:00:09.150> five<00:00:09.389> weeks<00:00:09.630> ago

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.600 
plants that we saw about five weeks ago
and<00:00:10.559> now<00:00:10.679> they're<00:00:10.920> probably<00:00:11.070> ready<00:00:11.400> for

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
and now they're probably ready for

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.120 
and now they're probably ready for
transplanting<00:00:12.300> 10<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.019> 15<00:00:13.349> centimeters<00:00:13.980> in

here is our broccoli which we've watered
well<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.670> before<00:00:54.059> transplanting<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.410> he's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
well now before transplanting so he's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.080 
well now before transplanting so he's
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> open<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> pot<00:00:56.820> here

going to open it up over to the pot here

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.599 
going to open it up over to the pot here
so<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.109> trees<00:00:58.440> seedlings<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.399> I'm

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
so we have trees seedlings in here I'm

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
so we have trees seedlings in here I'm
just<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> divide<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.449> mouse<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
just going to divide the mouse here to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.820 
just going to divide the mouse here to
split<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> root<00:01:02.039> ball<00:01:02.870> best<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.320> minimum

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
split the root ball best I can minimum

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.670 
split the root ball best I can minimum
disturbance<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> roots<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
disturbance to the roots and now that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
disturbance to the roots and now that
like<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> cities'<00:01:08.850> place<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.360> into<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
like the cities' place that into the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.469 
like the cities' place that into the
hole<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:12.619> try<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> keep<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> roughly<00:01:14.520> level

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
hole now try to keep it roughly level

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
hole now try to keep it roughly level
with<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:15.869> soil<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> find<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
with your soil as it was if you find a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580 
with your soil as it was if you find a
planter<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.060> too<00:01:18.299> top-heavy<00:01:18.590> becomes

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
planter bit too top-heavy becomes

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
planter bit too top-heavy becomes
various<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.600> brought<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> tango

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
various a little bit brought to tango

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
various a little bit brought to tango
top-heavy<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.549> grows<00:01:23.729> there's<00:01:24.210> no

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
top-heavy and as it grows there's no

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.539 
top-heavy and as it grows there's no
harm<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.869> Earthling<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.470> around<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
harm and Earthling up around it just to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.440 
harm and Earthling up around it just to
prevent<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.060> rocking<00:01:27.630> over<00:01:27.990> splitting

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
prevent it from rocking over splitting

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
prevent it from rocking over splitting
so<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:31.079> since<00:01:31.320> they're<00:01:31.500> between<00:01:31.770> your

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
so this since they're between your

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
so this since they're between your
broccoli<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.670> ideally<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.150> 30<00:01:34.079> centimeters

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:50.249 

that's<00:01:40.869> roughly<00:01:48.299> 30<00:01:49.299> centimeters<00:01:49.930> is<00:01:50.110> the

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
that's roughly 30 centimeters is the

00:01:50.259 --> 00:02:00.870 
that's roughly 30 centimeters is the
spacing<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.830> want<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:55.090> then<00:01:55.270> lastly<00:01:55.659> I<00:01:59.880> give

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
spacing you want and then lastly I give

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.639 
spacing you want and then lastly I give
it<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.030> good<00:02:01.180> give<00:02:01.659> it<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.780> good<00:02:01.869> press<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.440> then

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
it a good give it a good press in then

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.289 
it a good give it a good press in then
just<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.039> make<00:02:03.190> sure<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.640> good<00:02:03.789> contact

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
just to make sure that just good contact

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.020 
just to make sure that just good contact
between<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.229> seedling<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.430> soil<00:02:09.030> what

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
between the seedling and the soil what

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.309 
between the seedling and the soil what
you<00:02:10.149> have<00:02:10.300> your<00:02:10.420> row<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.780> sowed

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
you have your row of sowed
