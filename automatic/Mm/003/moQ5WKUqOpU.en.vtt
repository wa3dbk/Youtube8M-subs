00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:14.600
 Hello, I want to tell about my 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.320
 car purchased literally two days 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:22.300
 backwards 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:27.070
 today 23 6 13 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:31.400
 here before you buy this car from 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:37.490
 we go chevrolet cruze yes here is the average 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:40.730
 grade 16 volume here before 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:45.640
 buy this car I probably month 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:51.680
 2 probably studied by video review on 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:56.090
 reviews on the Internet are shorter than all that is possible 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:00.190
 find out about this car and friends 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:07.430
 to the stream that have the car at 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:11.260
 us a mirror all that could be learned about 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:17.350
 This car I learned in principle 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:21.330
 made his conclusions as if not responded 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.950
 car others let those who 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 let's say spread on the internet let's say 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.549
 there it is there something rattles something roars 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.770
 somewhere there are some flaws 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:41.619
 guys i'll tell you so this is all complete 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.890
 bullshit I took this car of the twelfth year 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:51.960
 let's say the car itself is the twelfth year 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:56.640
 end of December 3 well, like the beginning of 13 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.390
 I think that is no different already 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.220
 shorter 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:09.330
 in the thirteenth year all the same 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.580
 the only thing I don't know about 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.000
 some say that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.690
 18 there the ox the best the best 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 the best parameters of one 18 engine as 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.730
 I would not feel any difference 18 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.370
 and 16 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.459
 it also accelerates no problems 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.670
 no noise no squeaks 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.459
 yes of course the car is new because of this 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.109
 may be the same as it is new and how 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:48.070
 there could be no 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:50.980
 squeaks but just yesterday I drove by 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:56.709
 so I came here to the country like 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:59.109
 to my father-in-law and mother-in-law with his wife 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.600

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.260

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.299

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.860
 these cars the road you know I came to 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.820
 this car is shorter 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:23.170
 without any problems I like the fact that 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:31.450
 This car suspension high clearance then 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:32.650
 there is a high between how it shows here 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.960
 clearance high 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.520
 that is, I pass without problems shorter yes I 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.860
 I will not say that I'm right there we are some 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.630

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.160
 that is, the machine behaves at all 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.590
