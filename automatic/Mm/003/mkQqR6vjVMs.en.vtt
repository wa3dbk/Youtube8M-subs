 As soon as that was going to share to everyone I also was surprised it is to have recently noticed this 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.490
 Well then let's see how to do it right away 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.380

 Let's start safari Now this Uuripe 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:33.180
 It has been since the page of the house, but please see here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.620
 It looks like this on the wikipedia page. The search window in the site search is pro 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.570
 It is installed in 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.310
 For example, in wikipedia from now on, search the site in the search bar of safari from now on 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.250
 The other It is if you want to 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:49.420
 If you do a search twice or more in the playing Villie

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.800
 Then you go to the search bar above this, for example 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.980
 If you are the author of wikipedia and its domain wikipedia etc etc 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:05.830
 It is wii ke bad to say 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.500
