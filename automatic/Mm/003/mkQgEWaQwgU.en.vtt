hey guys today we're going to do a small
review<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.639> Wiley<00:00:15.089> X<00:00:15.240> blackops

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
review on the Wiley X blackops

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.500 
review on the Wiley X blackops
collection<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.890> what<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.670> here<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
collection and what we have here are the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.380 
collection and what we have here are the
revolver<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:20.250> airborne<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.980> air<00:00:22.980> rage

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
revolver the airborne and the air rage

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
revolver the airborne and the air rage
sunglasses<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:25.380> they're<00:00:25.590> black<00:00:25.830> ops

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
sunglasses now they're black ops

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
sunglasses now they're black ops
collection<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> reasons

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
collection I think one of the reasons

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.870 
collection I think one of the reasons
they<00:00:28.080> call<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.460> these<00:00:29.820> are

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
they call it that is because these are

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209 
they call it that is because these are
kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:31.470> they<00:00:31.590> call<00:00:31.800> covert

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
kind of a what they call covert

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.340 
kind of a what they call covert
protection<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.149> essentially<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.140> you've

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
protection so essentially what you've

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.270 
protection so essentially what you've
got<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:35.960> high-velocity<00:00:36.960> impact<00:00:37.350> protection

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
got is high-velocity impact protection

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.260 
got is high-velocity impact protection
with<00:00:38.700> shatterproof<00:00:39.300> lenses<00:00:39.960> yet<00:00:41.270> sunglasses

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
with shatterproof lenses yet sunglasses

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900 
with shatterproof lenses yet sunglasses
that<00:00:42.300> look<00:00:42.480> stylish<00:00:43.110> enough<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.910> mistaken

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that look stylish enough to be mistaken

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
that look stylish enough to be mistaken
for<00:00:44.940> everyday<00:00:45.390> glasses<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.440> that's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
for everyday glasses so I think that's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.619 
for everyday glasses so I think that's
kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> their<00:00:47.219> their<00:00:47.910> meaning<00:00:48.239> behind<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
kind of their their meaning behind the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.200 
kind of their their meaning behind the
covert<00:00:48.930> protection<00:00:49.500> angle<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.210> but

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
covert protection angle with this but

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.660 
covert protection angle with this but
these<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.079> good<00:00:52.199> glasses<00:00:52.520> then<00:00:53.520> we're

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
these are really good glasses then we're

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
these are really good glasses then we're
in<00:00:53.820> each<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.360> pairs<00:00:54.629> around<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
in each one of these pairs around for a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.400 
in each one of these pairs around for a
couple<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.559> days<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:57.079> really<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
couple of days now I really like the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
couple of days now I really like the
revolvers<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> best<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.489> feel<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.760> those

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
revolvers the best I feel like those

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.450 
revolvers the best I feel like those
just<00:01:00.239> kind<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.570> fit<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.840> face<00:01:01.050> better<00:01:01.460> but

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
just kind of fit my face better but

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
just kind of fit my face better but
that's<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.789> personal<00:01:03.270> preference<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.840> your

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that's just personal preference and your

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.789 
that's just personal preference and your
mileage<00:01:04.140> will<00:01:04.439> vary<00:01:04.470> obviously<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.799> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
mileage will vary obviously but like I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
mileage will vary obviously but like I
said<00:01:07.860> these<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.280> shatterproof<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.780> think

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
said these have shatterproof I think

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.109 
said these have shatterproof I think
they're<00:01:10.470> called<00:01:10.710> selenite<00:01:11.280> polycarbonate

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
they're called selenite polycarbonate

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.840 
they're called selenite polycarbonate
lenses<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.729> you're

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
lenses so I don't know if you're

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
lenses so I don't know if you're
necessarily<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.600> stop<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> bullet<00:01:16.170> like

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
necessarily going to stop a bullet like

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.100 
necessarily going to stop a bullet like
Superman<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.390> they<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.930> ads

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Superman but they do have some ads

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
Superman but they do have some ads
running<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.680> show<00:01:20.180> shrapnel<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.390> been

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
running that show shrapnel that's been

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.170 
running that show shrapnel that's been
stopped<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.650> these<00:01:22.830> glasses<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
stopped with these glasses kind of this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.550 
stopped with these glasses kind of this
kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> protection<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.590> NSI<00:01:26.270> 287

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
kind of protection which is a NSI 287

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.340 
kind of protection which is a NSI 287
standard<00:01:28.560> protection<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.640> actually

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
standard protection and I think actually

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
standard protection and I think actually
they're<00:01:31.350> their<00:01:32.189> standards<00:01:32.549> actually<00:01:32.880> exceed

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
they're their standards actually exceed

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.600 
they're their standards actually exceed
that<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.560> black<00:01:34.770> ops<00:01:35.009> collection<00:01:35.490> now

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that but the black ops collection now

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.660 
that but the black ops collection now
has<00:01:35.850> about<00:01:36.060> seven<00:01:36.600> different<00:01:36.689> styles<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
has about seven different styles on the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
has about seven different styles on the
airborne<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.659> air<00:01:39.840> rage<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.470> have

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
airborne and the air rage that we have

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
airborne and the air rage that we have
they<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.909> wanted<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> show<00:01:42.689> this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
they we wanted to kind of show this

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.249 
they we wanted to kind of show this
close<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.040> removable

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
close up they have this removable

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
close up they have this removable
climate<00:01:46.259> control<00:01:47.180> what<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.299> call<00:01:48.509> climate

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
climate control what they call climate

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.039 
climate control what they call climate
control<00:01:49.350> facial<00:01:50.130> cavity<00:01:50.579> seal<00:01:51.049> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
control facial cavity seal so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.319 
control facial cavity seal so
essentially<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.970> piece

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
essentially what you have is this piece

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.990 
essentially what you have is this piece
that<00:01:54.659> removes<00:01:55.579> like<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.969> can

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that removes like so and you can you can

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700 
that removes like so and you can you can
put<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.570> or<00:02:00.689> take<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.049> either<00:02:01.380> one

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
put this in or take it out either one

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.819 
put this in or take it out either one
but<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.790> got<00:02:02.969> these<00:02:03.119> vents<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.689> top<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
but it's got these vents on the top so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.830 
but it's got these vents on the top so
while<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.000> seal<00:02:06.329> around<00:02:06.630> your

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
while you have this seal around your

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.270 
while you have this seal around your
face<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.380> prevents<00:02:07.860> dust<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> wind<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
face that prevents dust and wind and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.970 
face that prevents dust and wind and
blocks<00:02:11.280> light<00:02:11.550> from<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.849> peripheral<00:02:12.300> vision

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
blocks light from your peripheral vision

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.860 
blocks light from your peripheral vision
like<00:02:13.129> that<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.209> these<00:02:14.390> vents<00:02:14.750> as

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
like that you you have these vents as

here but basically what you've got is
these<00:02:49.760> two<00:02:50.319> tabs<00:02:51.319> that<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:53.060> fits<00:02:53.420> into<00:02:54.579> so<00:02:55.579> it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
these two tabs that this fits into so it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.670 
these two tabs that this fits into so it
just<00:02:55.970> secures<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.629> like<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.989> very<00:02:57.260> easy<00:02:57.500> to
