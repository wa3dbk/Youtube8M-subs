 Post time 

00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:07.590
 The eagerness of time 

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:10.274

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:39.262

00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:44.282

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:45.904

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:49.024
 The young are not sports 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.008
 and don't have time. 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.892

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:56.013

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:57.857

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:12.319

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.256
 I can't accept it, 

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:29.318
 I didn't have the time. 

00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:34.326
 Lord, have all the time you give me ... 

00:01:35.543 --> 00:01:37.461
 The years of my life, 

00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:40.177
 The day of my year 

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:42.646
 the hours of my day 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.200
 are all mine. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.959
 It's me occupying them peacefully 

00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:51.020
 without lust. 

00:01:52.354 --> 00:01:55.840
 That afternoon I didn't pray, Lord, 

00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.935
 the time to do it, 

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:01.891
 That or that other thing. 

00:02:02.282 --> 00:02:05.715
 I beg you to know the grace, 

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:08.116
 time you give, 

00:02:08.373 --> 00:02:10.409
 What do you want me to do? 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.375
 amen
