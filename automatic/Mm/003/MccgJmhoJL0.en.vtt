so you'll click it once and I right here
this<00:01:33.689> will<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.079> your<00:01:34.130> IP<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> top<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
this will be your IP so at the top to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
this will be your IP so at the top to
find<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.579> rolling<00:01:38.820> since<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
find it this is just rolling since it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
find it this is just rolling since it
could<00:01:39.240> differ<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.930> everyone<00:01:40.259> else<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.530> not

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
could differ for everyone else I'm not

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.980 
could differ for everyone else I'm not
sure<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.490> would<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.729> type<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
sure you would just type in one at the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.490 
sure you would just type in one at the
end<00:01:43.110> i<00:01:43.259> believe<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.520> once<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> type<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.119> there

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
end i believe so once you type out there

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.210 
end i believe so once you type out there
it<00:01:46.500> will<00:01:47.329> take<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.720> page<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:50.040> might

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it will take you to a page you might

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460 
it will take you to a page you might
have<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> enter<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:51.390> password<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:52.170> username

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
have to enter your password or username

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.459 
have to enter your password or username
and<00:01:53.040> password<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.490> come<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
and password and then you come up to I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.139 
and password and then you come up to I
guess<00:01:58.469> basic<00:01:58.979> setup<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.820> don't<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
guess basic setup but you don't want to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
guess basic setup but you don't want to
do<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> go<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.310> applications

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
do that you want to go to applications

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.500 
do that you want to go to applications
and<00:02:02.460> game<00:02:03.290> applications<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.409> gaming

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
and game applications in gaming

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.700 
and game applications in gaming
which<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.500> right<00:02:07.070> here<00:02:07.780> see<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.810> would<00:02:09.500> show<00:02:09.680> you
