00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.859
 Ok let's explain now how 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.400
 it works the shock is a tim disk like this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.269
 more is required among dj 's like 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.710
 to do 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.640
 It's just a little bit like it's a little 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.420
 complicated to learn because you have 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 two ways to do the mall are you 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.700
 use the record going with the disc to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.230
 front and back only it can be a 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.079
 acute bit may be a bit less which 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:57.510
 we lose open or closed 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.359
 starting shop convention will open in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.270
 truth you have to take a little bit 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.590
 of the record going on a little bit of it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.590
 Coming back to the party grows fair and back. 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 threw a piece 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 shine for ever is and already was 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.799
 closed to come to his open side 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.700
 on the contrary you already start with the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.579
 register a bit ahead as he 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.030
 is here and you're going to pull him to the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.210
 against an impact burr 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:48.890
 and I went back throwing it shut 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 taking a piece and beautiful with it open 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.210
 and with closed price 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.689
 turning the disk upside down is the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.689
 mall 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 beauty then let's do with the bit 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.270
 now happening 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:49.190
 oh oh oh oh oh ih ih an
