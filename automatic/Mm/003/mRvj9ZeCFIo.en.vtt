00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 and how it is and how to do the elevator 60 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.740
 point 9.5 onwards or backwards 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.830
 editions back I mean the second 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.940
 point is not if it has a solution 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.940
 so let's start 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:29.150
 on the scale of 1 to 3 the types of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.220
 elevators that I know and the worst 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.460
 better than there is a guy so we started 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.690
 with number two this is mine 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.210
 I guess everyone already knows how they are 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.449
 first we need to put a poster by 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.699
 over water over water and so on 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.870
 successively until reaching the top of 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.870
 our elevator 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:58.309
 just keep pressing on the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.630
 car because the posters of the posters 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.340
 They are mainly to give us a 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.469
 kind of oxygen space for 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.390
 when you light so that we do not recharge 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.190
 self-margin of the debate and we do not have to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.160
 drown us to get up there 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.810
 but it does come because we went through the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.229
 second, it would be a little more complicated 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.500
 and we would not be much iron because you do not 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.500
 go 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:32.580
 for this we need if we will arrive as 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 a kind of ladder we will put a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.290
 block over to a main card with your skin 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.320
 and we will skip 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.960
 a height of 4 blocks maximum or 5 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.300
 and we'll put another mein thistle ok after 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.490
 we found out what's left to get 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.830
 The last magic techniques are 3 makers 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.390
 to get to the end so let's go 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.250
 to prove it first of all what is not 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 they are doing is to approach this main card 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.530
 and we will give the button to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.159
 we press the other and the other and others 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.160
 we just jumped out and got out of here 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.989
 we arrived at our second floor the place 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.910
 where it locates us now we will go to 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.500
 better than there is currently that is a bit 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:25.880
 more complicated to do because we would be 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:46.329
 a lot but it 's simple we just need 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:51.190
 a structure that what we will get 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.190
 good stairs we will need stairs 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:04.580
 and now we will sit two slowly and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.770
 we will put a space with him as 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.210
 subscribe finally two phases and 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.280
 commissioner must always have 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.850
 after the staircase a space in the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.390
 river than what is now what we will put 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.250
 is what anyone on top of each one 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.500
 of the stairs 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.540
 and on top of the block, we will put 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.370
 a very expensive expensive main 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.420
 curiel 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.420
 It is a main card 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.560
 and we will destroy the blocks that are 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.870
 under the main cannes 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.910
 now what would be missing would be the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.980
 last and this one I already put it before 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.980
 but this is so that we do not fall 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:55.870
 but why do I say it like that because if you 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.870
 you get here 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.530
 above 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.930
 let's say that we have what 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.460
 that we go out and stay and everything goes 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.380
 destroy the cup but if we 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.870
 we put the main kardec and what would happen 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.820
 it would be that we get to this master 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.190
 from here and then what you do not have 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.260
 time and ready we reached the top and 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.390
 we could sit freely 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.190
 we would fall 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.960
 liked to imagine 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.430
 first of all I'm preparing a map 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.590
 that they leave here the image in the part 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.720
 upper left of the upper mobile 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.340
 left of the screen to see 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.970
 the map you are saying with what 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.340
 I was doing with my friend in 2007 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.440
 for you to thank you for 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.620
 the 500 beautifully good makes 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.950
 currently more comfortable 568 out there but 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.950
 wait 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.370
 do not forget the goal and subscribe for more 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.000
 videos with this one and the eggs that says 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.670
 much 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.670
 I am your brother my bed and see you
