00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.870
 it takes 5 gil 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.160
 well then 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.780
 I believe 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.070
 then space 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.340
 you can not tell the stories but you produced them 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.150
 and that continues with 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.050
 Any game 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.490
 i 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.220
 what we 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.930
 percent there is a debt 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.509
