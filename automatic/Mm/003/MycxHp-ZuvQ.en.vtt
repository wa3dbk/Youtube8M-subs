00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
I loved the trailer I thought it was

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.290 
I loved the trailer I thought it was
pretty<00:03:03.500> much<00:03:03.680> as<00:03:03.920> good<00:03:03.950> as<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.490> trailer<00:03:04.760> Kincaid

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
because they can't be deceiving in this

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.060 
because they can't be deceiving in this
