 fat32 52 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.830
 China production 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.400
 told me to learn a couple began to walk 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.830

 letters 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.030
 logical class 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.030
 it has a motor and 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.230
 volume of seven and seven liters 350 horse 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.300
 forces 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.300
 installed here to him bosch 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.320
 electronic jets here stands with 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.050
 electronically controlled 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.870
 single plate clutch dry box 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 here stands a fuller 9 step song 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.050
 not 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.970
 buzova fifteen three cubic meters 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.770
 body loading capacity 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.799
 22 tons here 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.000
 we all understand that in twenty years he 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.310
 side 380 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.040
 more some more cases much 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.420
 more litigation 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.420
 talk about it 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.430
 if you are lucky 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.140
 more than 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.290
 what was put on you it was 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.290
 it can be understood that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.509
 and cardan transmission 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.940
 that with regards to fuel from the wall fuel 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.860
 system 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.900
 the main thing is very capricious and high quality 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.700
 diesel fuel quality fuel here 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.900
 kim way how to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.390
 avoid costly repairs 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.370
 it means I advise you to refuel only 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.819
 disassembled to here on proven not to pour 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.299
 fuel trucks with cans and so on 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:40.379
 I understand the topic that when water enters 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:46.560
 dirt in the fuel goes to building injector 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:48.750
 nozzles and so on pump and this is very 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.330
 expensive 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.450
 repairs 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.350
 It is possible to install additional 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.310
 filter 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.150
 to protect the fuel system filter 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.660
 rough cleaning 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.890
 so that with regards to leaving the quarry 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.440
 transmission c 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.100
 Here we see the levers to switch this 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.620
 transfer here please do not be lazy 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:18.530

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.710
 then you can already on the first 2 and so on 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.080
 speeds go further thanks 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.690
 this grip life I think 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.230
 will increase why because it will not 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:36.830
 such a load on the discs on the basket 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.959
 flywheel clutch means well while 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.840
 salon can tell a little about 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.330

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:54.620
 engine speed indicators 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.870
 car here we see the level gauge 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.700
 fuel tank air sensors air in 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.680
 contours 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:10.090
 car battery voltage 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.090
 oil pressure and engine temperature 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.680
 here we have a mountain brake 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.799
 It turns on by pushing yourself 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.270
 lever he is an extra brake 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.440
 to the main here they use it when 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.720
 downhill while ascii is loaded to 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.500
 he does not slow down this mode 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.230
 burning 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.510
 and linings no drums here on on 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.200
 the keys we have two buttons 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.550
 inter axle lock axial this button 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.860
 alarm signaling 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.840
 air switch button 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.280
 on electric 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.820
 advertising two keys with which 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.610
 body rises here I want to give advice on 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:00.620
 about these two keys please when 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.680
 enabled speed when enabled 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.590
 keys when we lift the body does not 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.330
 turn off the car or do not turn off these 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.540
 keys 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.300
 if you raised the body I would advise 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.970
 drivers if you raised the body 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.919
 turn off speed and on neutral 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.740
 speeds already you want to look like u 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.500
 you load down or make 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.360
 some sort of action from the body will explain 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:32.900
 why do we have these keys turned on 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:36.380
 the pump turns on the power take-off 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.540
 I turn off the cardan if I turn it off 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.180
 the ignition will happen accordingly 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.610
 on the contrary we will turn on the cardan and 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.680
 switch off the selection box 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.080
 car power us at this time 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.900
 standing on the handbrake 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.229
 The speed is on, that is, when you turn off 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.500
 Ignition occurs blow to the back 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.880
 cover 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.400
 gearbox 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.970
 several such blows and will have 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:07.290
 apply for bulkhead service 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:11.370
 boxes be careful means further 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:15.150
 here we have a heater control 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:19.920
 air conditioner in this car radio 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:23.780
 we have a cigarette lighter and an ashtray 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.780
 box trivia here we have the handbrake 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.780
 handbrake 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:38.220
 Well, with regards to winter to how reviews 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.490
 Owners for last winter I can varnish 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.380
 say not quite warm copy 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:48.450
 have to refine 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:52.550
 to warm it off, but I don't think 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:56.690
 what is it minus 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.450
 strong minus your car 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:04.790
 also 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:08.250
 I want to say that this cabin g5 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:11.880
 here's the next generation will be the g6 cab 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.640
 it is already here in russia the next 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.130
 report will be about this booth about this 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.910
 Euro-4 car 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:27.000
 so here the cabin has a sleeping bag 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:29.540
 quite spacious wide allows 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.070
 drivers to rest between flights either 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:36.420
 shift change 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:38.660
 sleeping bag is also here in the back 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:44.970
 where the glass holders are located 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:48.290
 electric fuses and relays all 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:51.060
 the main power goes through this block 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:54.330
 all principle at hand everything is convenient there 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.880
 translation from chinese to english 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:00.920
 There is also a translation manual for 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.920
 Russian so everything is clear everything is simple
