 to unplug the headlight washer 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.700
 you must remove the snap ring 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.620
 here it is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.289
 it is spring loaded but i will try it 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:29.669
 don't make solid plastic there 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 I do not want to spoil the seat where 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:37.910
 This snap ring is installed from 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.910
 my hotel compound lights 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:50.190
 work will be done on the removal of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:54.650

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 how to install the washer in the bottom 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 headlight parts there are two wonderful slots 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.090
 there are fasteners on the headlight wiper 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.060
 two pieces 1 bummer on but it's just 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.660
 broken show on the example of headlights 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.660
 washer 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.940
 set interferes in this way 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 mocks these clasps 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.200
 and just snaps in there to take out 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.010
 headlamp washer disassembly necessary 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.610
 press two fasteners at the same time or 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.960
 take turns and push it forward by 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.460
 car traffic 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.890
 but if you doubt your 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.310
 agility and its capabilities this one 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.040
 the procedure can be provided 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.080
 car service master because here 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.670
 need to have a certain dexterity 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.670
 but again if 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.360
 crawl by 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.810
 headlights 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.030
 i.e 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.989
 from here also as we turned away 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.360
 bolt the far washer is in the zone 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.560
 reach ie principle this job 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.560
 you can do it yourself 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.690
 again 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.459
 shove your hand under the spotlight groping here 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:21.290
 these latches now push them up and 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.290
 push the washer forward 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.230
 now it is necessary to unfasten the washers 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.230
 headlights 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.769
 at 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.099
 before removing the starchenko hose 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.099
 headlight washer better heat 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.900
 but since I came straight to the injectors 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.639
 then I'll tell you how to shoot them 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.199
 for replacement 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.199
 I'm here so shaybochku 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.679
 to remove their cap we turn down these 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.289
 here are the petals I will not do it because 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:02.479
 that the nozzle will not bend change 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.079
 Here are these petals under shaybochki worth 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.959
 spring 

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:08.479
 Naturally all this will come off to 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.849
 put a new nozzle in place 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.039
 you will either have an old shaybochki 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.009
 straighten these petals or replace this 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.699
 shaybochku just buy a new one together 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.699
 with nozzle 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.370
 and by the way to replace the nozzle and 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.820
 remove this shaybochku in general, then no 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.830
 needing to remove the bumper all this 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.490
 can be done with an installed bumper 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.610
 just as we have just shown us 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:42.460
 detach from the headlight nozzle pull out 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:46.250
 her forward further we remove the tube and 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.190
 accordingly, remove the nozzle set 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.610
 new put in place shaybochku that all 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.610
 simply
