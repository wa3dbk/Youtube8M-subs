00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.559
 today 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.559
 I would like to disassemble this iphone 4s for a while 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 As it has become gray out of common wi-fi 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.480
 So if you look at youtube 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:29.480
 It seems that there is a case to cure the wi-fi chip with a heat gun and heal it once 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.480
 I would like to try to see if it can really be done 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.420
 This has now become a wi-fi gray out 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.420
 I do not listen to 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.700
 Turn off the power 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.700
 Pull this shim 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.700
 In this once net 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.540
 Well disassembled driver for iphone 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.540
 I bought a little 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.300
 with this 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.300
 The annual income here 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.570
 Remove you 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.770
 Let it slide 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.140
 with this 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 Said panel was off 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.710
 In studying look Dechotto youtube of try for the first time a little time decomposition 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.030
 Well then 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.679
 I want to do it 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.960
 Eight 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.710
 Motherboard 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.710
 It is a guy 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.830
 So maybe 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.760
 This part is a wi-fi chip 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.760
 I guess it 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.920
 here 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:40.349
 With a heat gun 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.349
 Oh and to have a heat Te push something I'd like a very much heal 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:50.569
 If it shakes like this for a while, there is a possibility that the other part will be done with heat so well 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.519
 A little 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.519
 I think that I want more in what or 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:05.510
 For now 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:10.160
 I tried to place a piece of cardboard on this land and put it on for a moment so that I did not get hot 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.340
 I don't know if this is all right but 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:19.269
 I would like to go once 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:23.190
 Hey Well in the dryer so well I do not have really Well I'd heat gun is good 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.190
 I want to do it 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:32.880
 Perhaps it is better if heat is given at a stretch by a slightly stronger wind than by a weak wind , but perhaps no heat is transmitted 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:41.570
 In I think 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.570
 I would like to ne little Well against a little stronger of taxation NEP 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.290
 For now, I tried using a hair dryer, but still I am not so hot. 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.480
 Ne 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:06.770
 Since the little there was just a fan heater now winter of you 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:14.420
 Against a little about two minutes in front of the Haa heater 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:15.910
 I tried to sleep a little once until about not touching pretty hot and Well touched by hand 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.269
 but 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.590
 Well, for now, once again 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.590
 I would like to team up 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.060
 Somehow we were able to assemble up to here 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.120
 Put on the cover 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.750
 Itteyuu put a shim 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.750
 Then I want to turn on the power 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:58.399
 The 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:04.150
 I'm picking up wi-fi 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.080
 I will pick it up for now 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.290
 By the way, this is also a guy who has canceled 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.290
 3g is not wide 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.830
 I Oh e-mail will come full entered 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:37.290
 Is this just a temporary cure ? 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.290
 The one it is a little do not know me to remain fueled much 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.420
 For now, I 'm getting better now 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:03.830
 It is moving 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:06.300
 I just think that there is a sound that will probably be cured by people 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.840
 Well doing 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.340
 If broken 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.880
 Already 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:16.560
 Oh, I'm going to be self-responsible 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.560
 I think I want to do a bit 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.810
 For now 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.810
 I 'm cured for now 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:34.750
 If So also if also like wi-fi fatigue is no longer look around state 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:37.710
 I want to write in a little comment 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.710
 Thank you for watching
