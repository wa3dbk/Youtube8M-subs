00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890

City<00:00:22.680> get<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:23.189> particularly<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.670> first

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
City get going particularly the first

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.939 
City get going particularly the first
half<00:00:24.119> don't<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.590> puts<00:00:25.800> under

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
half don't know I think that puts under

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.870 
half don't know I think that puts under
a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> pressure<00:00:26.220> which<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.609> knew<00:00:26.730> they

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
a lot of pressure which we knew they

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.759 
a lot of pressure which we knew they
would<00:00:27.060> we're<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> always<00:00:27.960> start

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
would we're going to always start

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.290 
would we're going to always start
quickly<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> then<00:00:29.580> they've<00:00:29.849> got<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> good<00:00:30.119> home

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
quickly and then they've got a good home

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880 
quickly and then they've got a good home
support<00:00:30.810> behind<00:00:30.929> them<00:00:31.199> they're<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> good<00:00:31.859> team

we'll<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.239> come<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> end<00:00:57.629> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we'll be right up there come the end of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
we'll be right up there come the end of
the<00:00:57.750> season<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> moments<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> City

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the season at the moments of City

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
the season at the moments of City
winning<00:00:59.789> without<00:01:00.059> playing<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.510> their<00:01:00.629> best

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
winning without playing at their best

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
winning without playing at their best
yeah<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> best<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
yeah I think so I think the best is to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
yeah I think so I think the best is to
come<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.019> that's<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.290> sign<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.589> good

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
come but so that's a sign of a good

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.990 
come but so that's a sign of a good
scene<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.339> win<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.610> they're<00:01:05.939> not

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
scene when they can win and they're not

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.250 
scene when they can win and they're not
playing<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> best<00:01:06.450> football<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.930> hopefully

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
playing the best football so hopefully

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
playing the best football so hopefully
we<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.409> keep<00:01:07.560> improving<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> team<00:01:08.430> keep

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
we can keep improving as a team keep

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
we can keep improving as a team keep
working<00:01:09.030> hard<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.630> keep<00:01:10.049> moving<00:01:10.350> forward

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
working hard and and keep moving forward

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
working hard and and keep moving forward

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
you started with two strikers people

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400 
you started with two strikers people
wanted<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.090> start<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.570> two<00:02:23.750> strikers<00:02:24.080> but

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
wanted you start with two strikers but

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.810 
wanted you start with two strikers but
it<00:02:24.470> was<00:02:24.560> only<00:02:24.710> when<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.010> took<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.370> de<00:02:25.430> Bie<00:02:25.610> offer

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
it was only when you took a de Bie offer

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.510 
it was only when you took a de Bie offer
you<00:02:26.720> looked<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.290> better<00:02:27.740> team<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.070> started

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
you looked a better team and started

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.640 
you looked a better team and started
scoring<00:02:28.820> goals<00:02:28.970> why<00:02:29.240> was<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.480> not<00:02:29.840> only

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
scoring goals why was that not only

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.760 
scoring goals why was that not only
because<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.880> played<00:02:32.090> always<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:33.050> David<00:02:33.410> and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
because we played always with David and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.890 
because we played always with David and
seal<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.310> probably<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.940> movement<00:02:35.360> are

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
seal that probably the movement are

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.380 
seal that probably the movement are
better<00:02:36.290> but<00:02:36.800> they<00:02:36.980> think<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.310> Manuel<00:02:37.820> plays

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
better but they think that Manuel plays

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.800 
better but they think that Manuel plays
very<00:02:38.660> well<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.360> should<00:02:41.360> have<00:02:41.510> changed

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
very well but I should have changed

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.860 
very well but I should have changed
something<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.820> got<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.210> get<00:02:44.360> better<00:02:44.540> if

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
something have you got to get better if

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.840 
something have you got to get better if
you<00:02:45.110> have<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.410> stay<00:02:45.680> where<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.130> are<00:02:46.160> near<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
you have to stay where you are near the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.690 
you have to stay where you are near the
top<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.210> table<00:02:47.710> we<00:02:48.710> must<00:02:48.920> improve<00:02:49.220> always

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
top of the table we must improve always

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.860 
top of the table we must improve always
but<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.800> think<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.130> sun-diamond<00:02:52.870> is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
but I think that the sun-diamond is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.310 
but I think that the sun-diamond is
important<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:55.010> win<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.490> game<00:02:55.730> also<00:02:56.570> if<00:02:57.170> you

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
important to win this game also if you

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.010 
important to win this game also if you
don't<00:02:57.560> deserve<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> win<00:02:58.220> probably<00:02:58.570> but<00:02:59.570> I

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
don't deserve to win probably but I

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.530 
don't deserve to win probably but I
think<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.910> for<00:03:01.910> example<00:03:01.940> against

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
think that for example against

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.949 
think that for example against
Sunderland<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:03.430> lost<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:05.060> game<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.720> probably

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
Sunderland we lost a game that probably

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.220 
Sunderland we lost a game that probably
we<00:03:06.260> deserved<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:07.160> win<00:03:07.190> how<00:03:08.150> far<00:03:08.510> are<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.930> way

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
we deserved to win how far are you way

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.470 
we deserved to win how far are you way
to<00:03:09.920> integrating<00:03:10.670> all<00:03:10.790> these<00:03:10.940> new<00:03:11.209> players

good<00:03:38.330> enough<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.750> think<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:40.519> must<00:03:40.700> play

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
good enough I think that we must play

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.300 
good enough I think that we must play
always<00:03:41.360> for<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.370> for<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.489> top<00:03:43.760> always

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
always for the for the top always

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.700 
always for the for the top always
because<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.270> have<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.450> good<00:03:46.930> players<00:03:47.350> we<00:03:47.590> are<00:03:47.680> a

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
because we have a good players we are a

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.650 
because we have a good players we are a
good<00:03:47.890> team<00:03:48.070> but<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.730> know<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.300> we<00:03:49.480> must

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
good team but I know that we must

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.690 
good team but I know that we must
improve<00:03:50.050> but<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.650> must<00:03:50.920> play<00:03:51.100> always<00:03:51.430> for<00:03:51.610> the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
improve but you must play always for the

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.900 
improve but you must play always for the
maximum<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.990> if<00:03:53.590> we<00:03:53.770> think<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.100> ok<00:03:54.490> we<00:03:54.670> are<00:03:54.700> a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
maximum not if we think that ok we are a

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.240 
maximum not if we think that ok we are a
second<00:03:55.360> position<00:03:56.110> ok<00:03:56.380> is<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.740> good<00:03:56.950> position

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250
