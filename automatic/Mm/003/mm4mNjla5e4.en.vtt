00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
doing wrong in Germany I have a theory

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.939

that<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.789> relates<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.809> sharing<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that is relates to sharing I have a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
that is relates to sharing I have a
sense<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.399> determine<00:00:59.910> people<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.300> more

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

sense that determine people are more
about<00:01:00.719> savings<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.649> look<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
about savings I look at all the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.280 
about savings I look at all the
companies<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:02.969> promotes<00:01:03.449> savings<00:01:04.019> like

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
companies that promotes savings like

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.350 
companies that promotes savings like
Aldi<00:01:04.800> media<00:01:05.100> market<00:01:05.550> all<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:05.820> companies

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
Aldi media market all these companies

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450 
Aldi media market all these companies
all<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:06.990> German<00:01:07.350> companies<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.860> savings

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
all these German companies are savings

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
all these German companies are savings
and<00:01:08.640> practicality<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.630> maybe<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.960> should

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and practicality so maybe we should

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
and practicality so maybe we should
change<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.009> message<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.729> Germany<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.600> we

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
change the message in Germany and we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.719 
change the message in Germany and we
should<00:01:12.900> say<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.250> share<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
should say that if you don't share a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
should say that if you don't share a
little<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.270> wife<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:15.720> home<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.290> wrong<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
little of wife at home and you wrong the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
little of wife at home and you wrong the
world<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.159> free<00:01:17.280> maybe<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.700> should<00:01:17.850> say<00:01:18.060> make

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
world for free maybe we should say make

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
world for free maybe we should say make
money<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.710> Wi-Fi<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.549> save<00:01:20.880> money
