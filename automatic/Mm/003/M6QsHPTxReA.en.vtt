00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
dark circles and fat pads so we thought

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.729 
dark circles and fat pads so we thought
we<00:01:02.399> would<00:01:02.430> add<00:01:03.059> some<00:01:03.690> volume<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.229> erasing

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
we would add some volume and erasing

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.250 
we would add some volume and erasing
