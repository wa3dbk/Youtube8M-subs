want to share with you a couple things

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.179 
want to share with you a couple things
that<00:00:30.750> you're<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.410> notice<00:00:31.560> number<00:00:31.890> one

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that you're going to notice number one

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
that you're going to notice number one
this<00:00:32.489> may<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.090> everyone<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
this may not be for everyone because I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.970 
this may not be for everyone because I
use<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.380> lot<00:00:34.670> of<00:00:35.670> gel<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.110> some<00:00:37.469> people<00:00:37.590> may<00:00:37.829> not

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
use a lot of gel so some people may not

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.310 
use a lot of gel so some people may not
like<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.120> reason<00:00:39.270> why<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> lot

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
like that but the reason why I use a lot

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.889 
like that but the reason why I use a lot
of<00:00:40.350> gel<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.700> last<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.660> by

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
of gel is to make it last I can get by

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.180 
of gel is to make it last I can get by
with<00:00:43.500> using<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:45.000> lighter<00:00:45.750> gel<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.469> using<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
with using a lighter gel or using just a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
with using a lighter gel or using just a
little<00:00:47.579> bit<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.030> gel<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:49.079> I'll<00:00:49.379> end<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.710> having

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
little bit of gel but I'll end up having

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
little bit of gel but I'll end up having
to<00:00:50.039> redo<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.579> hair<00:00:50.969> basically<00:00:51.510> everyday

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to redo my hair basically everyday

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
to redo my hair basically everyday
because<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> sleep<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.340> night<00:00:53.640> even

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
because when I sleep on it at night even

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
because when I sleep on it at night even
with<00:00:54.239> my<00:00:54.449> satin<00:00:54.780> cap<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> morning<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.890> just

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
with my satin cap in the morning it just

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.060 
with my satin cap in the morning it just
has<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:57.719> more<00:00:57.780> frizz<00:00:58.379> than<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:59.039> prefer

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
has a lot more frizz than I would prefer

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.119 
has a lot more frizz than I would prefer
it's<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.510> awful<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.559> really

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it's not like it's awful but I really

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's not like it's awful but I really
like<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.520> curls<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.090> defined<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
like for my curls to be defined and the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
like for my curls to be defined and the
best<00:01:04.409> way<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> I've<00:01:04.860> found<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
best way that I've found to do that is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.350 
best way that I've found to do that is
to<00:01:06.150> put<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.290> product<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.670> let

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to put on a lot of product and then let

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750 
to put on a lot of product and then let
the<00:01:09.479> curls<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.930> looser<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> looser<00:01:10.799> over<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the curls get looser and looser over the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
the curls get looser and looser over the
course<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> three<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.510> four<00:01:12.750> days<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.350> we

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
course of three or four days and then we

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
course of three or four days and then we
do<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.920> date<00:01:14.130> five<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.909> something<00:01:15.270> like

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
do it on date five or something like

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.510 
do it on date five or something like
that<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.850> did<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> using<00:01:18.360> eco<00:01:18.930> styler<00:01:19.320> gel

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
that so I did this using eco styler gel

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
that so I did this using eco styler gel
like<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.820> hair<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.500> almost

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that I have movement it's not hard it'll

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.140 
that I have movement it's not hard it'll
harden<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.350> gets<00:01:34.560> completely<00:01:34.979> dry<00:01:35.610> but

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
harden up as it gets completely dry but

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.859

my hair and the curls bounce back the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
my hair and the curls bounce back the
crunch<00:01:47.070> from<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.549> gel<00:01:47.759> goes<00:01:48.030> away<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> hope

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.000 
smoothing in the gel so when I smooth on
the<00:02:24.310> gel<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.819> use<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.090> pink<00:02:25.269> eco<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:26.379> do<00:02:26.500> is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the gel I use the pink eco what I do is

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.100 
the gel I use the pink eco what I do is
I<00:02:27.580> take<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.720> dime<00:02:29.470> size<00:02:29.950> or<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:31.019> depending<00:02:32.019> on

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
I take a dime size or more depending on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.610 
I take a dime size or more depending on
how<00:02:32.319> much<00:02:32.440> hair<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.010> amount<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.909> gel<00:02:34.209> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
how much hair it is amount of gel and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.369 
how much hair it is amount of gel and
put<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.739> on<00:02:36.010> my<00:02:36.610> hair<00:02:36.909> and<00:02:37.180> smooth<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.049> through

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
put it on my hair and smooth it through

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.199 
put it on my hair and smooth it through
breaking<00:02:39.129> it<00:02:39.250> through<00:02:39.489> with<00:02:39.640> my<00:02:39.819> fingers

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
breaking it through with my fingers

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.849 
breaking it through with my fingers
making<00:02:40.629> sure<00:02:40.810> all<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.909> hairs<00:02:42.909> are<00:02:43.859> saturated

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
making sure all the hairs are saturated

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.770 
making sure all the hairs are saturated
and<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.379> just<00:02:47.980> get<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.940> next<00:02:49.090> section<00:02:49.569> and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
and then I just get the next section and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.050 
and then I just get the next section and
do<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.560> same<00:02:50.739> thing<00:02:51.010> all<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.579> smooth<00:02:51.940> it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
do the same thing all I do is smooth it

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.990 
do the same thing all I do is smooth it
on<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.079> rake<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.560> through<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.129> I<00:02:54.609> start<00:02:54.879> from

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
on and rake it through and I start from

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.710 
on and rake it through and I start from
the<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.900> go<00:02:56.440> up<00:02:56.769> towards<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
the back and that go up towards the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.110 
the back and that go up towards the
front<00:03:01.409> it's<00:03:02.409> following<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.950> same<00:03:03.670> process

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
front it's following the same process

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.580 
front it's following the same process
and<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.659> can<00:03:04.870> see<00:03:05.049> that<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.349> really

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
and so you can see that this really

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.970 
and so you can see that this really
helps<00:03:06.099> my<00:03:06.670> natural<00:03:07.659> curl<00:03:08.620> pattern<00:03:09.159> really<00:03:09.760> pop

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
helps my natural curl pattern really pop

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.099 
helps my natural curl pattern really pop
because<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.280> really<00:03:12.579> reduces<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.180> frizz<00:03:13.659> so

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
because it really reduces the frizz so

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.199 
because it really reduces the frizz so
that's<00:03:14.890> what<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:15.099> going<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.310> do<00:03:15.489> for<00:03:15.880> my<00:03:15.970> whole

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
that's what I'm going to do for my whole

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.300 
that's what I'm going to do for my whole
head<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.840> then<00:03:17.560> I'm<00:03:17.829> going<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:17.980> follow<00:03:18.160> that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
head and then I'm going to follow that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:32.760 
head and then I'm going to follow that
up<00:03:18.639> with<00:03:18.669> blow-drying

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.570 

you

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:04:27.530 

you

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:05:14.260 

you

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:30.510 

you

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:57.340 

you

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.750 

all<00:05:58.350> right<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.770> that's<00:05:58.950> it<00:05:59.160> I'm<00:05:59.340> basically

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
all right and that's it I'm basically

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.210 
all right and that's it I'm basically
all<00:06:00.090> done<00:06:00.480> here<00:06:01.050> I'm<00:06:01.350> just<00:06:01.710> adding<00:06:01.950> a<00:06:02.190> little

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
all done here I'm just adding a little

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.310 
all done here I'm just adding a little
bit<00:06:02.670> of<00:06:02.880> extra<00:06:03.180> gel<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.750> help<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:03.990> front<00:06:04.230> of<00:06:04.290> my

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
bit of extra gel to help the front of my

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.320 
bit of extra gel to help the front of my
hair<00:06:04.680> lay<00:06:04.920> down<00:06:05.160> a<00:06:05.460> little<00:06:05.760> bit<00:06:05.850> more<00:06:06.030> because

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
hair lay down a little bit more because

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330 
hair lay down a little bit more because
for<00:06:07.110> whatever<00:06:07.260> reason<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.770> front<00:06:07.980> of<00:06:08.070> my<00:06:08.160> hair

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
for whatever reason the front of my hair

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.640 
for whatever reason the front of my hair
doesn't<00:06:08.580> really<00:06:09.090> like<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:09.540> curl<00:06:09.930> as<00:06:10.260> much<00:06:10.500> as

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
doesn't really like to curl as much as

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.970 
doesn't really like to curl as much as
the<00:06:10.830> rest<00:06:11.090> but<00:06:12.090> you<00:06:12.480> can<00:06:12.660> see<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.680> know<00:06:13.770> it

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
the rest but you can see you know it

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.070 
the rest but you can see you know it
looks<00:06:14.160> it<00:06:14.610> looks<00:06:14.640> really<00:06:15.060> defined<00:06:15.450> have<00:06:15.840> nice

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
looks it looks really defined have nice

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.310 
looks it looks really defined have nice
chunky<00:06:16.860> curls<00:06:17.340> which<00:06:17.670> I<00:06:17.790> really<00:06:18.660> like<00:06:18.930> and

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
chunky curls which I really like and

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.130 
chunky curls which I really like and
over<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.280> next<00:06:20.400> couple<00:06:20.550> of<00:06:20.880> days<00:06:21.210> after<00:06:21.690> it

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
over the next couple of days after it

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.950 
over the next couple of days after it
dries<00:06:22.530> I'll<00:06:23.130> separate<00:06:24.090> the<00:06:24.240> curls<00:06:24.480> a<00:06:24.720> little

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
dries I'll separate the curls a little

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.010 
dries I'll separate the curls a little
bit<00:06:25.110> more<00:06:25.350> to<00:06:25.590> give<00:06:25.740> me<00:06:25.890> extra<00:06:26.340> volume<00:06:26.790> but<00:06:27.300> for

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
bit more to give me extra volume but for

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.930 
bit more to give me extra volume but for
right<00:06:28.140> now<00:06:28.200> I<00:06:28.410> just<00:06:28.830> popped<00:06:29.400> on<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.700> blow

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
right now I just popped on the blow

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.810 
right now I just popped on the blow
dryer<00:06:30.180> on<00:06:30.210> high<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:31.800> just<00:06:32.010> get<00:06:32.220> my<00:06:32.430> hair<00:06:32.640> to<00:06:32.790> dry

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
dryer on high to just get my hair to dry

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.810 
dryer on high to just get my hair to dry
faster<00:06:33.210> because<00:06:33.930> with<00:06:34.260> all<00:06:34.410> that<00:06:34.560> gel<00:06:34.890> it

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
faster because with all that gel it

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.760 
faster because with all that gel it
takes<00:06:36.030> a<00:06:36.150> really<00:06:36.420> long<00:06:36.840> time<00:06:37.110> for<00:06:37.170> my<00:06:37.500> hair<00:06:37.680> to

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
takes a really long time for my hair to

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.860 
takes a really long time for my hair to
dry<00:06:37.800> so<00:06:38.160> I<00:06:38.190> just<00:06:38.490> blow-dry<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:38.970> too<00:06:39.210> so<00:06:39.720> that

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
dry so I just blow-dry it too so that

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.450 
dry so I just blow-dry it too so that
it's<00:06:39.990> about<00:06:40.260> 80<00:06:41.250> to<00:06:41.580> 90<00:06:41.940> percent<00:06:42.230> dry<00:06:43.230> and<00:06:43.620> then

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
it's about 80 to 90 percent dry and then
