00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 good afternoon dear friends with you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.600
 perpetuum again 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.300
 or alexandar and of course 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.460
 little zhuzhik we got used to that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.639
 minecraft should be square but 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.980
 today we decided to go against the system and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.330
 finally do with trees 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.330
 what they should be 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 that is, round trunks are now perfect 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.369
 round look they're perfect they 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.199
 beautiful they are beautiful it is super round 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.029
 trunks 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 why do these trunks round well 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.290
 First look for realism 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.980
 now the trees have become more realistic 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.090
 although the foliage is still inviting 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 minor improvements 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.149
 roughly speaking the stems became round yet 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.059
 for one thing for the sake of building new 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.770
 perfect cool houses just like a little house in 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 the village 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.100
 one of these houses I have already built and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.370
 I'll show you how he looks 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 see it looks pretty nice 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 cool you can create interesting 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.820
 the village especially with round trunks 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.680
 it was possible to make similar houses from 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.130
 square trunks for example from 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.840
 square boards but the effect is not the same 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.299
 far from the same it looks like everything 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.750
 much more interesting but there is one 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.880
 minus 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.310
 when you want to put the glass in 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.710
 this house she normally will not know 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.770
 why do you see remains left and right 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 Here is such a crotch which 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.590
 prevents glass from becoming a circuit let's now 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.360
 I will show you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.549
 like i put glass here from put 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.159
 glass is glass and glass is here 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.960
 and we see only one panel with what it is 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.750
 Due I do not know apparently mod yet 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.940
 little flawed 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.950
 if we put the glass in one 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.980
 the hole turns out like this 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.590
 as if it requires supplement but sadly 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.000
 sadly you can get around this problem 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.440
 putting a number of boards 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.479
 like this 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.850
 noteworthy this moto is remarkable 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.570
 so that these round logs and not 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.540
 stacking example here such we set 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.030
 1 row of boards and put one more row here 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.850
 boards and as you can see they are beautiful 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.739
 faced here in such a pattern and 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.220
 it was such an indivisible connection 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.870
 such an interesting cross 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.209
 probably in principle all that we zhorikom 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.050
 wanted to tell you today build 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.780
 at home I think I told everything in detail everything 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.760
 I see, thanks for watching you 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.380
 zhuzhik here is such a small zhuzhi 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.840
 who will live in this house probably 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.840
 and Alexander and to new meetings yet
