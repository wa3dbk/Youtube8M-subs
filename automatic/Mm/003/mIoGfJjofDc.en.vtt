00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:14.179
 Hello everyone, Irina Yu Tube wrote 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.480
 I was asked to make a transplant video 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.250
 camry 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.449
 since i have a few of them 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:28.460
 here we take the little yellow here with us 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.460
 circled that it is yellow 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:38.450
 archival and we have something to increase young 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:43.700
 height 1 here here we see the second 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 young growth root and intense 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:52.379
 night or raise a whole cambria they don't 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.539
 love transplant but transplant 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 ideal when just the same growing young 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.570
 here are these sprouts so much 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.610
 good and no problem 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:13.189
 taking root and one day we will now 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.670
 yourself and get out of the pot to watch 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.670
 what do we have 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:34.630
 our roots are great ie nothing 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.630
 such a 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:46.030
 absolutely not, that is, they are so slightly 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:48.710
 softly literally lower spine 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.190
 a little bit it's probably from the fact that he was 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 the very bottom is also a root one 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:03.800
 I think that with him completely 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.520
 wall they do not need to do one thing 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.160
 the only thing that I would just transplant 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.310
 would have it in fresh bark a little bit with 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.600
 by the addition of this punishment she is so 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.390
 a little bit smaller 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:23.140
 that is, mix with larger ones 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.360
 here now to put pieces and after that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.420
 one day at least from a better two days 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.300
 about the land why you need to dry after 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.130
 transplants yes so that when we 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.340
 Do we get orchids from the pot when we 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.519
 we plant it anyway where it can 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.769
 slightly damaged the roots of what is 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.780
 are formed 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:52.420
 microcracks here and in order to avoid 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:57.860
 root decay, we still need 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:01.040
 dry orchid refrain from watering 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.299
 this way the orchid will tighten its 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:11.049
 framework cracks all of you after that 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:15.260
 shed root further 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:18.049
 usual cambrian care in principle 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.080
 they are not whimsical but some 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.570
 features still need to know they don't 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.560
 like very high temperature drops 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:32.840
 but nighttime content should 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:37.910
 be a little lower here but do not stoop 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.000
 below 16 degrees also love fresh 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.000
 air 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:50.290
 Well, in general, the compress was derived 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.350
 artificially here and for the lung 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.109
 keeping at home 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:01.519
 so complexity 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:07.600
 there is no care and cambra is recommended 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:09.010
 just the same for beginners to water the water 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.720
 cambra 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.840
 preferably either by the strait method or 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.950
 soaking down the pot 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.840
 soak it literally for two minutes and 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.200
 does not like to get a pot 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.040
 water stagnation in general in the roots 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.780
 so after watering in mandatory 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.960
 okay you need to drain some water from the pallet 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:44.630
 here we have to water regular 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:49.040
 but moderate fertilized orchid in the period 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:53.840
 growth period growth young sprouts 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:57.340
 mod as well as food budding so in 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.340
 right here we are this orchid que paso de 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.310
 shed and and rooted or here and after 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.550
 can already and fertilizer although honestly 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.860
 rooks even i liked in good i didn't 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.140
 Dr. Holly with Amber Vitamins 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.110
 acid that is, you can put it 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:20.390
 process shedding root 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.380
 and after that on the sheet and and fertilize so 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.750
 how are we all the same 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:30.620
 leaf fertilizer does not replace root 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.630
 dressing here but in principle again what 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.720
 jyj root is still very much there 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.310
 vitamins of various microelements so 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:44.360
 that I think one with the other will go like 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:47.090
 just the same for the benefit of arch turkey plant 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.660
 Orchid without problems also put in 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.419
 potty 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.280
 notes are covered with bark i think i'm this 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.979
 I will not show why because 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.040
 There are already a lot of commercials and how 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.280
 plant mini orchids and that's how 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.340
 put ordinary phalaenopsis in principle 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.640
 nothing complicated, and the same thing we 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.640
 will do 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:17.270
 Orchid Cumbria Hideki 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:21.850
 very fragrant here bloom beautifully 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:25.130
 the flowers are very beautiful in them so 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:29.660
 really very very pretty 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.750
 orchid ki all thanks for your attention
