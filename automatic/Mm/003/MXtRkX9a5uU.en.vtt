00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.150

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.059
 opportunity we are going to make a barbecue in the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.580
 part of the networks that is the peceto and what 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.590
 let's make with mash of kino 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.990
 you get the opportunity I have it almost 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.290
 ready only for the banana and you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.869
 can explain the step I have taken up 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.320
 get to the point that is right now this 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.960
 this dish we already have different ready and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.840
 the cut is cut we go here 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.420
 then we have alcohol peceto I 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.890
 I cooked, I even cut it and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.380
 in the same sauce 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.809
 that has cooked that has reduced that same 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.239
 sauce in the smoothie and the sifted in the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.660
 sauce that we can cook is the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.010
 celery tomatoes carrots and a few 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.120
 peppers and obviously we have to 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.830
 season according to the taste of each 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.680
 one 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.619
 and there in cooking it's over 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.650
 undo all the vegetables that we have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 put and it's already a paste and silicone and it 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.330
 makes the sauce as you see it is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.340
 a sauce like this about cooked 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.180
 this precept about two hours per hour and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.440
 average depending on the type of peceto 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.479
 because I feel that they are very hard 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.170
 devoured a little more and what we're going 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.820
 to do is to plate and here we have ready and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.120
 what we have here is a puree of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.490
 quinoa lloret the logical thing has been a 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.580
 little more than normal and recognized the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.860
 of sieving and we have already liquefied with a 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.580
 little milk conjures from normal 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 traditional and butter and a little 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.210
 fly or white pepper if you like 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.190
 throw him and obviously that salt and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.120
 we can make a paste that is 1 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.260
 gene so 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:04.450
 everything we are going to proceed now is to plate 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.939
 and we are going to take the puree 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.539
 first we throw the puree so that the 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.150
 sauce the peceto do not make us 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.470
 linked in lanzarote can not do it 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.340
 Once they can do if they like what 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.950
 You can wear golden ornament a little more 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.510
 crispier how to do that 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.510
 to do this operation 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.570
 so 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.850
 in this part have we put 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.350
 what we have a necessary amount 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.970
 like all to proceed works where the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.970
 objects 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.990
 what we are is power 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.470
 6 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.470
 ah 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.360
 if we like they can do with another type 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.250
 of meat not necessarily complete but 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.920
 I can buy it for the same admission 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.380
 that is, doing the same by tracking 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.750
 what has been done here with explanation 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.530
 with desire previously 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.300
 then it's with you 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.209
 our project is already what 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.350
 we do is sant be a bit above 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:49.330
 what's necessary I have that we are not 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.330
 being necessary to be able to mix 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.549
 and we will put the world 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.380
 and a detail 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.380
 so you can see the plate 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.380
 and there's our pc pto 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:45.319
 the puree can replace it with other 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.319
 things and not if they do not like him 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.720
 if you can nevertheless put mashed 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.720
 potatoes or rice 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.680
