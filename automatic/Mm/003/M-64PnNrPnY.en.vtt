00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.099
 the first step is do not criticize this 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.740
 first step is so important is that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.410
 you achieve it you will not have to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.900
 practice any of the others because they 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:27.119
 will automatically come to and with the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 criticism never say I'm an idiot looks 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.090
 the mistake I made the word I said 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.530
 I stopped telling you how impulsive I am. 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.920
 How many mistakes I made with my children? 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.410
 it is not a question of denying reality if 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 impulsivity for example is a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.809
 your characteristic 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.690
 and if it hurts you look 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.969
 manage it the best way possible 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.750
 to prevent it from causing damage to you 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.750
 or others but do not get criticized 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:10.790
 it will not be easy to stop criticizing if 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:15.970
 because for many years you do it more 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:19.520
 everything in life is a process start now 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.640
 pay attention to this trend and repeat 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.270
 many times that you do not want to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.270
 criticize 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.170
 when you will be surprised by accusing yourself 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.220
 in thought or out loud 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.690
 stop immediately and say something 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.940
 positive and true respect 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.940
 try doing it now 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.370
 the criticism does not change anyone 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.580
 because criticisms are accusations that generate 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:12.620
 guilt and not a loving help that 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:15.560
 changes most of the time. 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.530
 criticism does not take into account who we 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.070
 we are and what are our 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.210
 real possibilities 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:30.920
 so if the reviews do not work 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.760
 Let's use another tactic. Let's start with 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.760
 a fundamental point 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.080
 the cei that as you are to then 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.310
 to promote the changes you want 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:51.260
 When you accept it, it 's amazing how 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:56.210
 changes become easier or 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.700
 what I'm going to say now our power is 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.000
 in the choice of thoughts we have and 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.910
 of the words we use because our 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.890
 thoughts contribute to everything that 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.340
 we do in life, it's you who choose your 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.340
 thoughts 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.150
 want to see if you made an impulsive gesture 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:25.930
 who hurt someone you have two choices 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:30.430
 can accuse if thinking that wrong thing 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:34.420
 I'm going to do it, I do not really have it 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.270
 Or you may think I'm a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.640
 impulsive person and so I did that 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.500
 that offended my friend 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.580
 I have to learn from this not to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.490
 repeat and I will apologize saying 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.830
 how much I like him and how I do not want 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.750
 I hurt him 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.160
 you notice the difference between the two 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.030
 thoughts it is easy to know which of the two 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.430
 help positively for a change 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.610
 then always choose the 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.130
 thoughts that fuel an incentive and 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.310
 support 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.150
 if you really want to love is 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.660
 essential to stop criticizing now and 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.660
 forever 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.190
 definitively 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:34.320
 you are able to do this you can 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.320
 do it say it out loud now 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.160
 I promise to make an effort to stop myself. 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.160
 criticize 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.590
 I promise to strive to have 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.640
 positive thoughts about me and the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.640
 respect for others
