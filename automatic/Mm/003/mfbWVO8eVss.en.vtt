it's been a major part of my game since
I<00:00:22.769> started<00:00:23.070> playing<00:00:23.160> FIFA<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:24.000> defensive

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
I started playing FIFA as a defensive

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.150 
I started playing FIFA as a defensive
player<00:00:24.779> someone<00:00:25.109> really<00:00:25.439> focuses<00:00:25.980> on

stopping the opposition I would say at

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.540 
stopping the opposition I would say at
least<00:00:28.470> 1/3<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:28.980> goals<00:00:29.189> come<00:00:29.429> from

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
least 1/3 of my goals come from

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
least 1/3 of my goals come from
counter-attacks<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.570> FIFA<00:00:30.779> 14<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

the<00:00:34.469> way<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.739> crossing<00:00:35.219> seems<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.520> bit

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

overpowered<00:00:36.510> you're<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.710> able<00:00:37.770> to

score goals out of counter-attacks I

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
score goals out of counter-attacks I
think<00:00:40.110> everyone<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.680> relate<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.489> in

think everyone can relate to that and in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.130 
think everyone can relate to that and in

the counter-attacking quick quick tactic

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
the counter-attacking quick quick tactic
which<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> same<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.920> everyone<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
which is the same for everyone this is a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.359 
which is the same for everyone this is a
default<00:01:51.020> you're<00:01:52.020> gonna<00:01:52.200> push<00:01:52.350> down<00:01:52.649> twice<00:01:53.070> on

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
default you're gonna push down twice on

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.399 
default you're gonna push down twice on
the<00:01:53.850> directional<00:01:54.299> pad<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.200> apply

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the directional pad and you will apply

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440 
the directional pad and you will apply
this<00:01:55.500> counter-attacking<00:01:56.310> method<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
this counter-attacking method and I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.670 
this counter-attacking method and I
threw<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> right<00:01:57.930> when<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.140> switching

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
threw it right when I'm switching

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
threw it right when I'm switching
everything<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.579> go<00:01:59.700> forward<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> score

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
everything to go forward and the score

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.749 
everything to go forward and the score
goal<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.610> provides<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
goal is I think that it provides a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
goal is I think that it provides a
little<00:02:02.790> bit<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> better<00:02:03.390> effect<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.140> seems

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
little bit of a better effect it seems

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319 
little bit of a better effect it seems
like<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:04.979> more<00:02:05.219> players<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.579> commit<00:02:06.180> to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
like I get more players to commit to

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.570 
like I get more players to commit to
attacking<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.710> board<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.399> me

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
attacking and to get on board with me

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.639 
attacking and to get on board with me
and<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.300> does<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> tells<00:02:09.989> all<00:02:10.259> those

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and what that does is it tells all those

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
and what that does is it tells all those
guys<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.979> switched<00:02:11.280> mentalities<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:11.879> they

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
guys have switched mentalities now they

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.350 
guys have switched mentalities now they
want

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
want

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.880 
want
forward<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.870> score<00:02:13.050> goals<00:02:13.320> when<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.710> say

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
forward and score goals when you say

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.190 
forward and score goals when you say
counter-attack<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.790> means<00:02:15.030> nap<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.840> that's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
counter-attack that means nap and that's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.870 
counter-attack that means nap and that's
so<00:02:16.440> crucial<00:02:16.740> for<00:02:17.040> throwing<00:02:17.370> those<00:02:17.520> bodies<00:02:17.850> in

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
so crucial for throwing those bodies in

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.660 
so crucial for throwing those bodies in
into<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.960> attack<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.530> scoring<00:02:20.070> additional

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
into the attack and scoring additional

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.280 
into the attack and scoring additional
goals<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.090> making<00:02:21.210> things<00:02:21.390> happen<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.200> you
