00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.550 
is very good at it I personally haven't
really<00:02:59.700> ever<00:02:59.850> gotten<00:03:00.210> it<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.600> think<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.320> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
really ever gotten it I think it's a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.650 
really ever gotten it I think it's a
pretty<00:03:02.280> risky<00:03:02.730> throw<00:03:02.970> even<00:03:03.210> my<00:03:03.390> teammate

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
pretty risky throw even my teammate

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.030 
pretty risky throw even my teammate
that's<00:03:03.810> practice<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> lot<00:03:04.530> can't<00:03:04.800> do<00:03:04.920> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that's practice that a lot can't do it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.430 
that's practice that a lot can't do it
all<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.310> time<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.790> think<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.660> lot<00:03:06.840> safer<00:03:07.110> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
all the time I think it's a lot safer to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.890 
all the time I think it's a lot safer to
just<00:03:07.500> go<00:03:07.740> ahead<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.010> run<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.490> get<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
just go ahead and run it get you know to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.450 
just go ahead and run it get you know to
