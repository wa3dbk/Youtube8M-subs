 now you know as rock star by 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.829
 rockstar pulled a dlc a couple of days ago 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.420
 and said that it consisted of two parts one 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.489
 part that we already have two days ago 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.930
 and the second one that will come out I suppose more or 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.600
 less within a month a month and a half 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.390
 where guys I bring you the new weapons 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.940
 that will put in this dlc where guys 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.950
 we're not going to call it leaks because 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.899
 they are not, they are 100% real information and 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.480
 Now I'm going to teach you so that 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.340
 see where guys in a forum a 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.200
 boy put an information that now 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.969
 same I will put on screen some 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.350
 codes but what else do the most part 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:09.229
 ahead of the video I'm looking for 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.939
 that are 100 real forgive if I'm 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.729
 speaking a bit fast but it's that 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.470
 I am very happy the truth now 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.290
 we have the information on the screen 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.119
 as you see raquel daxter we see what the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.860
 dax ter kills and also below 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.990
 piston marksman 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.119
 these guys the first thing is the fist 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.119
 American that we already had in old 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.130
 versions of gta 5 or gta forgiveness 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.600
 I liked it very much that they returned it 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.970
 to put because it is a weapon that has 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.619
 liked since always and right now 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.500
 I guess on screen you will be seeing 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.539
 if we have jotas and jay right now 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.009
 of the big auto vice city with his fist 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.740
 American in case there is someone who does not know 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.810
 what weapon is it can be manually in 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.789
 the second part of the dlc and now 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.319
 we had in the vice city in san 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.479
 andreas and I think that in the grand theft 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.220
 auto 4 I think that too and it hit me 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.830
 quite well that we did not have it in 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.780
 this gta 5 then guys also talk 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.750
 refers to these codes to a 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.420
 new weapon to a weapon a pistol 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.610
 marksman pistol or something like that and put 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.560
 reference to a new gun that they are going to 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.390
 I do not know if they are going to put something else but 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.020
 these are two of the weapons that have 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.030
 with a part of the video that has 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.160
 very much liked to check it by 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.930
 myself that these codes are inside 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.390

 here in 64 we will see dlc packs and 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.560
 here we leave the dlc is that we have gone 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.190
 taking on people 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 5 as you see christmas the robberies all 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.319
 that and here the deluxe is worth going 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.900
 in the deluxe lfp efe or whatever it is called in 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.360
 the 64 guys and here we're going to go into 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.940
 I think it's patch let's go into 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.450
 in small patch data in which a 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.760
 little bit long america in global rpf and 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.319
 here guys that I was freaking out 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.370
 come out the things that have been putting 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.220
 It's worth noticing guys there's nothing here 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.660
 that the duster this is the American fist 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.000
 I was freaking out but I liked it 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.730
 very much is the American fist that already 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.739
 We had large auto vice city has 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.450
 the san andreas and now I finally think that 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.370
 the grand theft auto 4 was also 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.980
 sure yes and now we will have it in 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.160
 grand theft auto 5 finally as you see already 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.030
 that the boys duster makes reference 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.760
 completely to this as you see here 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.250
 we have many things but nothing that 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.260
 the dax ter raquel daxter kills is worth 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.989
 is the American fist one hundred percent 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.450
 guys, how are you going to put it on 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.880
 yes and then there are some others 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.120
 files worth I have to look at me the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.310
 well because as you see here it also makes 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.410
 in mention to another gun that they are going to 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.330
 put markmann pistol kills and ya 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.639
 we had one so it was like the shotgun 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.130
 of combat I think it's about 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.300
 a last shotgun they put wrong in 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.919
 guys I do not know if it's the combat 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 exactly but it's one of the last 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.479
 of leces because here it refers to 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.889
 another gun just makes some 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.810
 reference some other things but 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.270
 that at the moment I do not have much idea 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.060
 guys but good as you see great mars 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.490

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.150
 part of the tlc in egg and as you see guys 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.130

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.110
