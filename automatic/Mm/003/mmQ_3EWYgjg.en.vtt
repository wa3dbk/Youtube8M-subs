would automatically there's no such
thing<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.390> there's<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.680> luigi<00:01:41.130> cart

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
thing as a there's this is luigi cart

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.090 
thing as a there's this is luigi cart
there's<00:01:42.000> no<00:01:42.240> such<00:01:42.420> thing<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.690> an<00:01:42.900> evil<00:01:43.229> luigi

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
there's no such thing as an evil luigi
oh<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.369> probably<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:47.270> there<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.450> actually<00:01:48.690> yeah

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
oh it probably is there is actually yeah

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
oh it probably is there is actually yeah
well<00:01:49.890> that's<00:01:50.310> only<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
well that's only because it's just

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.380 
well that's only because it's just
connecting<00:01:52.050> dots<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:53.399> clearly<00:01:53.789> luigi<00:01:54.360> is
