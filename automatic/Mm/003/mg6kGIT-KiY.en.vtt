00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
fantastic and if you can combine video

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.620 
fantastic and if you can combine video
and<00:01:32.799> data<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.970> can<00:01:34.119> do<00:01:34.180> that<00:01:34.210> now<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.570> a

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
and data and you can do that now in a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.719 
and data and you can do that now in a
really<00:01:34.900> compelling<00:01:35.290> way<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:36.189> audience<00:01:36.580> has

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
really compelling way the audience has

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.789 
really compelling way the audience has
got<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.970> ability<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.390> choose<00:01:37.750> how<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.680> wants

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
got the ability to choose how it wants

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.260 
got the ability to choose how it wants
to<00:01:38.979> consume<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.400> content<00:01:39.549> so<00:01:39.939> they<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.150> go

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
to consume that content so they can go

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.870 
to consume that content so they can go
for<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.479> very<00:01:40.689> traditional<00:01:40.840> lean<00:01:41.770> back<00:01:41.880> start

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
for a very traditional lean back start

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.069 
for a very traditional lean back start
the<00:01:42.939> presentation<00:01:43.090> or<00:01:43.570> they<00:01:43.659> could<00:01:43.720> really

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
the presentation or they could really

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.170 
the presentation or they could really
get<00:01:44.229> involved<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.829> dig<00:01:45.040> down<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.610> think<00:01:46.060> that's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
get involved and dig down I think that's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.440 
get involved and dig down I think that's
fantastic<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.869> giving<00:01:47.110> people<00:01:47.439> choice

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
fantastic and giving people choice

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.600 
fantastic and giving people choice
I<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:50.799> we've<00:01:50.920> reached<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.159> point<00:01:51.219> where

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
I think we've reached a point where

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.219 
I think we've reached a point where
consumers<00:01:52.539> are<00:01:52.630> incredibly<00:01:53.079> demanding

across everything then you know soon as
you<00:01:55.000> give<00:01:55.090> them<00:01:55.210> one<00:01:55.360> set<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.140> innovations

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
you give them one set of innovations

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.080 
you give them one set of innovations
very<00:01:57.039> quickly<00:01:57.219> taken<00:01:57.549> for<00:01:57.670> granted<00:01:57.850> and

spin-off possibilities of how does this

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.340 
spin-off possibilities of how does this
become<00:03:05.170> fan<00:03:06.069> facing<00:03:06.720> experience<00:03:07.720> instead<00:03:08.079> so

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
become fan facing experience instead so

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.410 
become fan facing experience instead so
imagine<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.130> second<00:03:09.489> like<00:03:09.670> arcade<00:03:10.120> games

in training where you can see them on

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.789 
in training where you can see them on
the<00:03:38.849> pitch<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.840> it's<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.319> intimacy

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799

again<00:03:41.159> of<00:03:41.390> whoever<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.540> football<00:03:42.810> fan<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.080> I

again of whoever the football fan is I

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.509 
again of whoever the football fan is I
think<00:03:43.379> everyone<00:03:43.799> would<00:03:43.920> want<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.190> see<00:03:44.310> what

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
think everyone would want to see what

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.430 
think everyone would want to see what
it's<00:03:44.640> like<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.060> be<00:03:45.150> little<00:03:45.390> messy<00:03:45.780> scoring

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
it's like to be little messy scoring

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:55.250 
it's like to be little messy scoring
that<00:03:46.530> goal<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.190> match<00:03:53.930> Lee<00:03:54.930> we<00:03:55.079> went

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
thinking one of the managers just taken

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.640 
thinking one of the managers just taken
him<00:04:14.430> off<00:04:14.579> if<00:04:14.760> I'm<00:04:15.030> seeing<00:04:15.450> on<00:04:15.629> screen<00:04:15.659> exactly

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
him off if I'm seeing on screen exactly

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.900 
him off if I'm seeing on screen exactly
what<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.949> manager<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.370> seeing<00:04:17.609> throw<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
what the manager is seeing throw the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.210 
what the manager is seeing throw the
system<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.449> my<00:04:18.479> coach<00:04:18.900> actually<00:04:19.799> go<00:04:19.859> okay<00:04:20.190> i

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
system like my coach actually go okay i

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.650 
system like my coach actually go okay i
can<00:04:20.340> understand<00:04:20.789> why<00:04:20.940> he's<00:04:21.060> just<00:04:21.090> dragged<00:04:21.479> him

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
can understand why he's just dragged him

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.810 
can understand why he's just dragged him
off<00:04:21.780> because<00:04:21.900> actually<00:04:22.350> he's<00:04:22.560> done<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.760> I

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
off because actually he's done and I

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.159 
off because actually he's done and I
think<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.060> becomes<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.449> really<00:04:24.720> exciting

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169
