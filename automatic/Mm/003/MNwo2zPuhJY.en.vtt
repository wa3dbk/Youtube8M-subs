little of a boxy fit and I love that
about<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.410> also<00:00:19.590> cropped<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.310> it's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
about it but it's also cropped so it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.279 
about it but it's also cropped so it's
adding<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:21.029> little<00:00:21.270> bit<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> sex<00:00:21.750> appeal<00:00:21.869> as

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
