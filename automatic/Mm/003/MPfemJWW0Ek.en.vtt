00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
wouldn't matter that much because he

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.619 
wouldn't matter that much because he

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
not that effective but I go for a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.860 
not that effective but I go for a
stockpile<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.059> let<00:00:48.210> everyone<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.539> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

Mawile doesn't have any V's and speed

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.810 
Mawile doesn't have any V's and speed
it's<00:00:51.510> mostly<00:00:51.930> offensive<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.949> its<00:00:53.070> speed<00:00:53.550> it's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it's mostly offensive but its speed it's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.420 
it's mostly offensive but its speed it's
just<00:00:54.000> bad<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.530> mention<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> physical

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.029 
just bad not to mention in the physical
department<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.120> emphasize<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.379> defenses

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
department I emphasize a lot on defenses

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.819 
department I emphasize a lot on defenses
but<00:00:59.250> against<00:00:59.579> moves<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.469> it<00:01:01.469> doesn't

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

protein greninja mostly ninjas you see
nowadays<00:01:18.299> our<00:01:18.659> protein<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.259> I've<00:01:19.320> seen<00:01:19.530> some

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
nowadays our protein and I've seen some

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
nowadays our protein and I've seen some
of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.070> bigger<00:01:20.250> people<00:01:20.790> use<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> lot

of the more bigger people use it a lot

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.810 
of the more bigger people use it a lot
and<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.380> takes<00:01:22.590> down<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.799> Gliscor<00:01:23.460> very

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and it takes down the Gliscor very

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.380 
and it takes down the Gliscor very
easily

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
easily

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
go for a u-turn which changed in what

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.679 
go for a u-turn which changed in what
bug<00:01:34.320> type<00:01:34.610> if<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> last<00:01:36.210> Pokemon

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
bug type if it was the last Pokemon

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.149 
bug type if it was the last Pokemon
there<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.170> wouldn't<00:01:37.470> me<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:37.950> last

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
there if wouldn't me it will last

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.340 
there if wouldn't me it will last
against<00:01:38.640> talonflame<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.659> had<00:01:39.810> gale<00:01:40.049> wings

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
against talonflame if it had gale wings

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
against talonflame if it had gale wings
I<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.890> definitely<00:01:41.130> been<00:01:41.549> screwed<00:01:42.240> and

Lucario or in this sense it evolved even

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.790 
Lucario or in this sense it evolved even
further<00:02:44.810> okay<00:02:45.810> he<00:02:45.959> goes<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.440> extreme

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
further okay he goes for the extreme

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.040 
further okay he goes for the extreme
