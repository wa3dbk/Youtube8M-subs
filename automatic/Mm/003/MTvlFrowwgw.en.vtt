guys<00:00:21.110> came<00:00:21.470> from<00:00:21.710> SOCOM<00:00:22.550> came<00:00:22.789> from<00:00:22.880> a

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
guys came from SOCOM came from a

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.160 
guys came from SOCOM came from a
background<00:00:23.060> of<00:00:23.300> that<00:00:23.420> kind<00:00:23.510> of<00:00:23.600> scum<00:00:23.810> smaller

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
background of that kind of scum smaller

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.109 
background of that kind of scum smaller
kind<00:00:24.440> of<00:00:24.529> like<00:00:24.740> tactical<00:00:25.130> action<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:25.520> this<00:00:25.910> is

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
kind of like tactical action and this is

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.790 
kind of like tactical action and this is
for<00:00:26.420> lack<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.600> a<00:00:26.660> better<00:00:26.690> term<00:00:26.840> a<00:00:27.080> huge<00:00:27.500> game

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
for lack of a better term a huge game

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.740 
for lack of a better term a huge game
absolutely<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:28.910> obviously<00:00:29.510> with<00:00:29.720> the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
absolutely so obviously with the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.240 
absolutely so obviously with the
PlayStation<00:00:30.289> 3<00:00:30.410> we<00:00:30.529> got<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:30.650> lot<00:00:30.859> more<00:00:30.890> power

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
PlayStation 3 we got a lot more power

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.830 
PlayStation 3 we got a lot more power
that<00:00:31.430> we<00:00:31.550> can<00:00:31.670> kind<00:00:31.760> of<00:00:31.880> tap<00:00:32.029> into<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.599> try<00:00:32.780> to

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
that we can kind of tap into to try to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.299 
that we can kind of tap into to try to
create<00:00:33.050> different<00:00:33.350> games<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:33.949> so<00:00:34.070> we<00:00:34.129> sat

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
create different games and so we sat

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.380 
create different games and so we sat
down<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.550> tried<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:34.789> figure<00:00:34.970> out<00:00:35.180> how<00:00:35.329> we

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
down and tried to figure out how we

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.580 
down and tried to figure out how we
could<00:00:35.570> take<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.989> lot<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.320> shooter

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
could take a lot of the shooter

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.479 
could take a lot of the shooter
experience<00:00:36.980> that<00:00:37.070> we<00:00:37.130> had<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:37.399> that

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
experience that we had and that

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.280 
experience that we had and that
knowledge<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.000> create<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.570> new<00:00:38.630> game<00:00:38.930> that<00:00:38.960> was

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
knowledge and create a new game that was

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.020 
knowledge and create a new game that was
going<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:39.440> be<00:00:39.530> unrivaled<00:00:40.160> basically<00:00:40.790> one<00:00:40.910> that

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
going to be unrivaled basically one that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.130 
going to be unrivaled basically one that
could<00:00:41.120> only<00:00:41.210> be<00:00:41.329> done<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.630> PlayStation

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
could only be done to PlayStation

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.680 
could only be done to PlayStation
already<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.100> obviously<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.570> the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
already and so obviously this is the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.880 
already and so obviously this is the
game<00:00:44.840> that<00:00:44.870> came<00:00:45.140> out<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.410> brainstorm

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
game that came out of that brainstorm

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
actually drew inspiration from real-life

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.269

been playing a long time so our

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.699 
been playing a long time so our
character<00:03:12.840> development<00:03:13.109> system<00:03:13.439> is<00:03:13.530> much

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
character development system is much

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.500 
character development system is much
more<00:03:13.889> about<00:03:14.069> customization<00:03:14.510> personalizing

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
more about customization personalizing

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.390 
more about customization personalizing
and<00:03:15.629> specialization<00:03:16.379> rather<00:03:16.949> than<00:03:17.069> just<00:03:17.280> you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
and specialization rather than just you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.679 
and specialization rather than just you
know<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> linear<00:03:17.849> progression<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.510> some

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
know a linear progression like some

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.059 
know a linear progression like some
other<00:03:18.810> game<00:03:18.989> see<00:03:19.199> that<00:03:19.349> make<00:03:19.469> you<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.799> better

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
other game see that make you just better

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.209 
other game see that make you just better
so<00:03:21.199> somehow<00:03:22.199> they'll<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.590> some<00:03:22.680> kind<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.919> scaly

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
so somehow they'll be some kind of scaly

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.220 
so somehow they'll be some kind of scaly
element<00:03:23.579> were<00:03:23.669> like<00:03:23.849> if<00:03:24.060> somebody<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.199> a

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
element were like if somebody like a

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.809 
element were like if somebody like a
real<00:03:25.379> group<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.829> squads<00:03:26.129> given<00:03:26.459> there's<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.669> new

guy you know the fng for lack of a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.319 
guy you know the fng for lack of a
better<00:03:28.650> term<00:03:28.799> comes<00:03:29.129> into<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> group<00:03:29.730> he's<00:03:30.180> not

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
better term comes into a group he's not

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.849 
better term comes into a group he's not
gonna<00:03:30.449> get<00:03:30.599> slotted<00:03:30.989> right<00:03:31.109> away<00:03:31.290> that's

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
gonna get slotted right away that's

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.709 
gonna get slotted right away that's
absolutely<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> goal<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.359> that's<00:03:33.510> one<00:03:33.689> of

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 
absolutely the goal so and that's one of

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.270 
absolutely the goal so and that's one of
the<00:03:33.810> reasons<00:03:34.109> behind<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.409> squad<00:03:34.680> mentality

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
the reasons behind the squad mentality

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.469 
the reasons behind the squad mentality
is<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.639> when<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:36.000> bring<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.359> new

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
is that when you bring in a new

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.580 
is that when you bring in a new
character<00:03:36.720> into<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.019> game<00:03:37.169> you<00:03:37.290> want<00:03:37.439> other

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
character into the game you want other

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
setting it look that goes a little bit

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.260 
setting it look that goes a little bit
near<00:04:30.280> future<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:30.729> is<00:04:30.849> it<00:04:30.940> kind<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.210> a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
like a near future like 10 years down

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.700 
like a near future like 10 years down
the<00:04:34.120> line<00:04:34.150> or<00:04:34.509> what<00:04:35.110> exactly<00:04:35.409> is<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.530> time

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
the line or what exactly is the time

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.439 
the line or what exactly is the time
frame<00:04:35.860> for<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.220> only<00:04:36.550> 10<00:04:36.759> 20<00:04:37.030> years<00:04:37.060> down<00:04:37.240> the
