it<00:02:15.340> from<00:02:15.459> us<00:02:16.290> these<00:02:17.290> are<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.770> ways<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:17.980> we

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
it from us these are the ways that we

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.449 
it from us these are the ways that we
prevent<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.940> gun<00:02:19.120> from<00:02:19.300> being<00:02:19.540> used<00:02:19.720> against<00:02:20.230> us

but we also need that gun to work for us

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.640 
but we also need that gun to work for us
and<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.330> need<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> fast<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.290> simple

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
and to do that we need a fast and simple

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.740 
and to do that we need a fast and simple
way<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.860> deploy<00:02:27.190> it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
way to deploy it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.280 
way to deploy it
that<00:02:28.750> means<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.230> gun<00:02:29.439> has<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:30.010> be<00:02:30.159> ready<00:02:30.430> in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that means the gun has to be ready in

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.899 
that means the gun has to be ready in
fractions<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.439> a<00:02:32.500> second<00:02:32.980> under<00:02:33.400> stress<00:02:33.730> when

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
fractions of a second under stress when

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.309 
fractions of a second under stress when
you're<00:02:34.090> hyper<00:02:34.269> focused<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:34.959> something

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
you're hyper focused on something

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.030 
you're hyper focused on something
trying<00:02:35.469> to<00:02:35.560> kill<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:36.159> to<00:02:36.700> grab<00:02:36.999> that<00:02:37.209> gun

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
trying to kill you to grab that gun

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.959 
trying to kill you to grab that gun
point<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.310> gun<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:39.849> shoot<00:02:40.079> that<00:02:41.079> gun<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:42.700> to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
point that gun and shoot that gun not to

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.360 
point that gun and shoot that gun not to
try<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.209> chamber<00:02:43.749> that<00:02:43.900> round<00:02:44.230> before<00:02:44.829> you<00:02:45.219> can

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
try to chamber that round before you can

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.349 
try to chamber that round before you can
save<00:02:45.639> your<00:02:45.819> life
