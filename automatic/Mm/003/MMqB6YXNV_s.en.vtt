demonstration when they would do the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.949 
demonstration when they would do the

six what we just demonstrate to you is
the<00:04:21.520> ideal<00:04:22.030> situation<00:04:22.300> where<00:04:23.050> three<00:04:23.290> people

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
the ideal situation where three people

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.310 
the ideal situation where three people
know<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.700> step<00:04:24.970> they<00:04:25.630> can<00:04:25.810> do<00:04:25.990> by<00:04:26.170> themselves

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
know the step they can do by themselves

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.380 
know the step they can do by themselves
and<00:04:26.860> make<00:04:27.450> half<00:04:28.450> turns<00:04:28.870> on<00:04:29.200> everybody<00:04:30.100> music

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
and make half turns on everybody music

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.560 
and make half turns on everybody music
but<00:04:31.390> for<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.840> new<00:04:32.470> students<00:04:33.210> highly<00:04:34.210> unlikely

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
but for you new students highly unlikely

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.700 
but for you new students highly unlikely
it<00:04:35.290> will<00:04:35.440> probably<00:04:35.700> take<00:04:36.700> you<00:04:37.230> two<00:04:38.230> or<00:04:38.260> three

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
it will probably take you two or three

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.650 
it will probably take you two or three
times<00:04:39.310> repeating<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:39.970> bronze<00:04:40.210> one<00:04:40.420> class

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
times repeating the bronze one class

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.030 
times repeating the bronze one class
before<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.290> do<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:42.460> what<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:43.030> do<00:04:43.390> is

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
before you can do that so what you do is

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.120 
before you can do that so what you do is
don't<00:04:45.040> worry<00:04:45.340> about<00:04:45.460> making<00:04:45.730> a<00:04:45.940> half<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.270> turn

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
don't worry about making a half a turn

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.880 
don't worry about making a half a turn
let's<00:04:48.130> say<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.370> can<00:04:48.610> only<00:04:48.760> make<00:04:49.590> half<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.740> that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
let's say you can only make half of that

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.850 
let's say you can only make half of that
so<00:04:51.550> let's<00:04:51.790> say<00:04:52.480> I<00:04:52.540> do<00:04:52.720> basic<00:04:54.240> size<00:04:55.240> ways<00:04:55.860> size

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
so let's say I do basic size ways size

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.670 
so let's say I do basic size ways size
ways<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.480> get<00:04:58.690> myself<00:04:58.870> going<00:04:59.380> with<00:04:59.590> the

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
ways just to get myself going with the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.970 
ways just to get myself going with the
music<00:05:00.040> I<00:05:00.220> do<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:01.300> little<00:05:01.690> bit<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:01.990> half<00:05:02.170> turn<00:05:02.500> or

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
music I do a little bit of half turn or

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.760 
music I do a little bit of half turn or
reverse<00:05:03.490> turn<00:05:03.820> but<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.570> don't<00:05:04.900> make<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.260> but

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
reverse turn but I don't make it but

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.700 
reverse turn but I don't make it but
don't<00:05:06.010> panic<00:05:06.220> just<00:05:06.670> use<00:05:07.420> a<00:05:07.450> size<00:05:07.870> way<00:05:08.230> to

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
don't panic just use a size way to

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.670 
don't panic just use a size way to
adjust<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:10.180> make<00:05:10.360> sure<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:10.810> man<00:05:11.020> is<00:05:11.260> facing

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
adjust to make sure the man is facing

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.320 
adjust to make sure the man is facing
forward<00:05:12.930> along<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.230> line<00:05:14.410> of<00:05:14.590> dance<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:15.330> you

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
forward along the line of dance and you

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.050 
forward along the line of dance and you
can<00:05:16.480> practice<00:05:16.780> without<00:05:16.840> practice<00:05:17.470> that<00:05:17.650> way

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
can practice without practice that way

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.760 
can practice without practice that way
four<00:05:19.060> five<00:05:19.570> see<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.140> is<00:05:20.260> what<00:05:20.410> we<00:05:20.530> do<00:05:20.650> in

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
four five see this is what we do in

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.080 
four five see this is what we do in
class<00:05:21.540> using<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:22.630> size<00:05:22.900> way<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.290> adjust<00:05:23.590> as<00:05:24.190> we

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
class using the size way to adjust as we

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.200 
class using the size way to adjust as we
practice<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.440> left<00:05:26.800> turn

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.520 

I<00:05:32.270> will<00:05:33.270> demonstrate<00:05:33.449> this<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.710> music<00:05:35.479> doing

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
I will demonstrate this to music doing

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.330 
I will demonstrate this to music doing
size<00:05:37.530> ways<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:38.100> adjust<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.699> then<00:05:39.050> continue<00:05:40.050> on

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
size ways to adjust and then continue on

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.629 
size ways to adjust and then continue on
dancing<00:05:41.479> the<00:05:42.479> reverse<00:05:43.110> turn<00:05:43.319> properly

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
dancing the reverse turn properly

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.820 
dancing the reverse turn properly
showing<00:05:44.639> you<00:05:44.910> what<00:05:45.509> the<00:05:45.660> ideal<00:05:46.139> situation

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830
