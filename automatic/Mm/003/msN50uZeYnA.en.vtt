didn't like about the stove other than
the<00:00:29.490> price<00:00:30.320> was<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.349> fact<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> put

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the price was the fact that when you put

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
the price was the fact that when you put
it<00:00:32.669> together<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.829> these<00:00:35.040> two<00:00:35.340> slots<00:00:36.140> now

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it together you have these two slots now

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.639 
it together you have these two slots now
the<00:00:37.230> one<00:00:37.530> slot<00:00:38.540> has<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> piece<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.230> metal<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the one slot has a piece of metal that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
the one slot has a piece of metal that
just<00:00:40.860> goes<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:42.649> like<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.600> but<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
just goes into it just like that but the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.360 
just goes into it just like that but the
second<00:00:46.230> slot<00:00:46.590> has<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.940> little<00:00:48.210> piece<00:00:48.570> that

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
second slot has this little piece that

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.459

like you could stick a pen or a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.070 
like you could stick a pen or a
toothpick<00:01:25.259> into<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> assembly<00:01:26.580> slot<00:01:26.990> sort<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
toothpick into the assembly slot sort of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.469 
toothpick into the assembly slot sort of
like<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> cotter<00:01:28.619> pin<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.549> hold<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.939> assembled

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
like a cotter pin to hold the assembled

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.300 
like a cotter pin to hold the assembled
stove<00:01:30.810> together<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> look<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
stove together and if you look at it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.910 
stove together and if you look at it
it's<00:01:35.430> true<00:01:35.759> there's<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.329> hole<00:01:36.509> where

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
it's true there's a little hole where

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.060 
it's true there's a little hole where
where<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> folded<00:01:38.460> metal<00:01:38.729> comes<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:40.070> now

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
where the folded metal comes out now

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.889 
where the folded metal comes out now
what<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> did<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.390> too<00:01:42.420> small

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
what I did I think it's way too small

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.899 
what I did I think it's way too small
for<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.320> toothpick<00:01:43.860> unless<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.520> doing<00:01:44.640> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
for a toothpick unless you're doing with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.380 
for a toothpick unless you're doing with
really<00:01:45.240> fine<00:01:45.450> toothpicks<00:01:46.079> plus<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.390> toothpick

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
really fine toothpicks plus a toothpick

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.649 
really fine toothpicks plus a toothpick
made<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> wood<00:01:49.110> would<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.530> burn<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:50.659> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.020 
know can you see this look at that and
play<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:38.630> can<00:02:39.630> put<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.459> Trangia<00:02:41.459> in

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
play with it I can put the Trangia in

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.250 
play with it I can put the Trangia in
and<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.450> doesn't<00:02:42.660> fall<00:02:43.020> apart<00:02:44.690> being<00:02:45.690> metal<00:02:46.140> I

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
and it doesn't fall apart being metal I

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.690 
and it doesn't fall apart being metal I
don't<00:02:46.500> think<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> heat<00:02:47.190> will<00:02:47.400> affect<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:49.700> but

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
don't think the heat will affect it but

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.530 
don't think the heat will affect it but
thanks<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.709> Daedalus<00:02:53.360> that's<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
thanks to not really Daedalus that's a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.740 
thanks to not really Daedalus that's a
pretty<00:02:54.780> cool<00:02:54.989> idea<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:57.000> those<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.600> that

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
pretty cool idea so those of you that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.120 
pretty cool idea so those of you that
have<00:02:57.959> these<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.500> haven't<00:02:58.800> already<00:02:58.890> done

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
have these if you haven't already done

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.229 
have these if you haven't already done
something<00:02:59.640> like<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.090> could<00:03:00.180> also

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
something like this you could also

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.750 
something like this you could also
probably<00:03:00.780> stick<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:00.989> wire<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.560> there<00:03:01.769> but<00:03:02.730> I

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
probably stick a wire in there but I

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.130 
probably stick a wire in there but I
think<00:03:03.060> something<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.050> much<00:03:04.290> harder

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
think something like this is much harder

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.140 
think something like this is much harder
okay<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:07.560> not<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.190> Daedalus<00:03:08.940> for

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
okay so I think not really Daedalus for

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.890 
okay so I think not really Daedalus for
that<00:03:09.269> idea

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
that idea

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.420
