00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.510
 on 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.510
 hor 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.249
 all believed this 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.909
 Hello dear video friends 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.799
 something is going to happen today 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.380
 I would say extraordinary or special because we will 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.269
 We are dealing with this video specifically with some questions that concern me 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.390
 Guests have reached 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.509
 namely after the presentation of the 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.589
 that prevents contrast 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.289
 Heise Themis got 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.489
 what should I buy now I am like a mobile flash unit 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.710
 Now I have the big one in the middle and actually capable of that very cool 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.090
 like this on playgrounds 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.830
 around 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.800
 I always have a lot of problems answering the unfortunate thing 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.450
 Try it a bit in this text form today 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.790
 around 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.090
 I hope so 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.440
 that already this dichotomy about it you could know what you have 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.160
 there is not really the right recommendation because that would actually be the 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.400
 apple pears and and and and what insurance companies compare 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.240
 I can say that is the best solution 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.880
 because every animal goes 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.020
 its purpose and also has its purpose 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.630
 otherwise it is secretary not at all 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.050
 we come yes 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.100
 quite often with these on the squares 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.490
 the insanely cool thing we see percent still standing there 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.369
 behind it 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.290
 It can not be much smaller than that 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.190
 however, and now it starts 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 powerful hunting of course this solution is not exorbitant and man 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.880
 has another thing and that would be that she has food for 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.560
 tremendous this system is because some stuck on the camera where we buy 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.230
 just let's go take the WAK with radio trigger ray-ban to things 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.649
 somewhere storm rows 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.050
 and take it as light sources which works wonderfully and which is cool 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.290
 but actually SMI he did not go that way 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.300
 an example here a guide in the other the pope know so the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.350
 the Denic us as well stands there with 18 broadcasts on full power 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 Allow to cool for two minutes or 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.740
 something like that I've never been a topic percent and 10 already a two things 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.060
 dived from it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.160
 because just cap the Bible back and fuck them 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.369
 You will notice that when you constantly with it on full power photographed 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.780
 it can be problematic 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.040
 Nevertheless 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.830
 This is probably the portals to solve which there is now 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.110
 So I just want to let that stand here, we have to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.879
 just depends on portability 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.309
 it's the best solution 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.759
 However, there are some who have not said that 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.939
 Portability leads to it when it comes to performance because we see 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.329
 quite clearly on this 3 successful 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.539
 large 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.269
 low power with high power performance 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.809
 that's always a balancing out 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.879
 a lot of ice for a lot of weight 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.209
 Mean middleweight performance means little power and little weight 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:48.109
 there you have to find yourself at all - in German questions what with the 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.339
 wanted to take pictures 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:54.430
 Without you knowing whereupon drill takes off the animals photographically target 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.480
 Can not you decide what you need 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.099
 there is no solution that we can have quite often 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.010
 left the big center at home because we just did not go to the west 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.540
 Corinna said if he prefers photography without me 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.159
 Parents last than that because I do not have dead slots in the summer at 30 degrees 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.769
 Gales Wiedemann stuff with it always get on the PC 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.769
 and he must be annoyed that we did not have the big stuff with us both 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.729
 would have needed the power 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.650
 now we had a good experience with the Wenger and 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.160
 because what even the favorite said the RBS could have quietly 5 kilos more 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.990
 and for that we need to admire or dazzle PadmÃ© twice more 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.640
 Achievement and that's exactly what you had with your vows, yes, yes 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.980
 smaller could be quiet 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.309
 you realize this is a fight that you can win in Vienna 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.070
 therefore my recommendation is considering you 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.730
 there is no light anymore latif easy way it gives either it needs power 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.730
 that means you are photographed with big light sources from Location 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.919
 did not lead to a big device uniting its thousand watts close 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.609
 because we say okay we photographed "Vogue" like nomads 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.409
 Money watches and and and have to get all the flash heads in a backpack 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.609
 then probably the correct solution 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.820
 this thing here 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.470
 because four portals are not and if it absolutely wants to have that 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.059
 with in the delivery room if this in this regard 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.239
 it can do everything 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.609
 but there are still the more extreme ends then probably the CFU 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.079
 the hits for you 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.849
 The whole thing was here 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:19.849
 priced 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.400
 yes, I also want to say so hard 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.780
 Lord give us nothing because if we calculate how we expect two of us 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.680
 or three of those do not need readers with corresponding radio house 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.969
 correspond to adapters 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.029
 Percent to build this somewhere 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.570
 then we come already in the relatively high range 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.570
 And as I said there is still this little bit of booze 1 yes of the 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.460
 usability 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.220
 what used to be the case with the devices is not the case because that's easy 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.220
 Studio facilities are 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.900
 I hope that helped you a bit 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.820
 maybe also technically speaking what could be quite interesting 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.939
 his 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.129
 here we have concerns 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.170
 those on the squares 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.870
 the senses cool thing I stay so absolutely brilliant thing 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.450
 However, the haptic probably already built somewhere the reflector he 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.909
 stuck firmly on it too 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.819
 therefore he does not always have such a fight against this already existing light 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:09.389
 to form 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.819
 that means im always somehow working against this against 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.850
 do not soften this from the 8th 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.009
 and so far and so on, eat here with the others 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.449
 two people year at the real studio solutions give lightning and hab 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.449
 who did not wish him where he serves does not formally could pack around it 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.990
 that puts leadership and from the light possibilities I would say it is 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.620
 of course, also a topic 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.620
 but it always does not help you Henry Seifert height after again not 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.699
 smarter you're just smarter we come to a decision here for you 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.699
 even I hope it helped you 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.379
 around 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.509
 that was also a lot of fun reading from me that block posts and 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.129
 more details thanks is until 11
