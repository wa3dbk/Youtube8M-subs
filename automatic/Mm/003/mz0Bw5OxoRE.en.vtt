put this on it's really easy and as you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
put this on it's really easy and as you
can<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.579> took<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.939> off<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.570> hard

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
can see I took it off so that's not hard

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120

either<00:01:57.960> because<00:01:58.290> some<00:01:58.469> cases<00:01:58.770> are<00:01:58.890> really

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
either because some cases are really

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
either because some cases are really
hard<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> take<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.780> plastic

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
hard to take off but this one is plastic

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
hard to take off but this one is plastic
so<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.759> hard<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.210> not

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so it's not really that hard it's not

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
so it's not really that hard it's not
like<00:02:03.450> metal<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.439> bend<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.950> all

a second parts of the comments and this

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.870 
a second parts of the comments and this
is<00:05:10.740> what<00:05:10.889> it<00:05:10.979> is<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.490> reason<00:05:11.639> I'm<00:05:11.850> doing

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
is what it is and the reason I'm doing

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.820 
is what it is and the reason I'm doing
this<00:05:12.150> is<00:05:12.300> because<00:05:12.600> there's<00:05:13.410> going<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.800> be

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
this is because there's going to be

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.070 
this is because there's going to be
unlimited<00:05:14.190> entries<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.419> can<00:05:15.539> enter<00:05:15.840> more

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
unlimited entries so you can enter more

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.450 
unlimited entries so you can enter more
than<00:05:16.139> once<00:05:16.440> it's<00:05:16.650> not<00:05:16.710> like<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.919> limited<00:05:17.190> number

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
than once it's not like a limited number

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.100 
than once it's not like a limited number
of<00:05:17.639> times<00:05:17.940> they<00:05:18.150> can<00:05:18.330> enter<00:05:18.630> anything<00:05:18.900> like

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
of times they can enter anything like

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.170 
of times they can enter anything like
that<00:05:19.169> you<00:05:19.349> can<00:05:19.500> comment<00:05:19.830> like<00:05:20.070> every<00:05:20.400> day<00:05:20.520> 10

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
times a day whatever you want but

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.260 
times a day whatever you want but
because<00:05:22.949> i<00:05:23.099> don't<00:05:23.280> want<00:05:23.340> YouTube<00:05:23.759> to<00:05:23.820> mark<00:05:24.150> it
