00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.860 
basically you can doubt down your sights
on<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.099> higher<00:03:17.310> power<00:03:17.609> scope<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.359> shooting<00:03:18.750> at

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
on the higher power scope so shooting at

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.259 
on the higher power scope so shooting at
long<00:03:19.049> range<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.470> much<00:03:19.650> easier<00:03:20.120> instead<00:03:21.120> of

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
long range is much easier instead of

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.000 
long range is much easier instead of
having<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.630> aim<00:03:21.900> your<00:03:22.109> crosshair<00:03:22.530> above<00:03:22.799> your

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
target you can zero to the distance

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.660

you're<00:03:24.810> away<00:03:25.109> from<00:03:25.319> them<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.709> then<00:03:26.340> put<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
you're away from them and then put the

and<00:03:36.209> 1000<00:03:36.840> meters<00:03:37.079> let's<00:03:38.069> say<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.400> your<00:03:38.519> target

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
and 1000 meters let's say if your target

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.970 
and 1000 meters let's say if your target
is<00:03:38.910> 1,000<00:03:39.510> meters<00:03:39.690> away<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.319> you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.799> that

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
is 1,000 meters away and you know that

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.190 
is 1,000 meters away and you know that
for<00:03:41.160> sure<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:42.060> have<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.359> go<00:03:42.389> to<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.720> 1000

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
for sure you have to go to the 1000

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.809 
for sure you have to go to the 1000
meter<00:03:43.319> setting<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.489> gun<00:03:44.670> will

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
meter setting and the gun will

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.090 
meter setting and the gun will
compensate<00:03:45.150> for<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.540> bullet<00:03:45.780> drop<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.769> mix

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
compensate for the bullet drop this mix

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.069 
compensate for the bullet drop this mix
sniping<00:03:47.459> much<00:03:47.819> easier<00:03:48.269> because<00:03:48.569> now<00:03:49.019> you

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
sniping much easier because now you

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.050 
sniping much easier because now you
don't<00:03:49.319> have<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.470> guess<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.829> blow<00:03:49.980> drop<00:03:50.280> to

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
don't have to guess the blow drop to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.309 
don't have to guess the blow drop to
find<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.359> right<00:03:51.480> distance<00:03:51.720> you're<00:03:52.049> away<00:03:52.260> from

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
find the right distance you're away from

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.140 
find the right distance you're away from
your<00:03:52.470> target<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.310> can<00:03:53.340> equip<00:03:53.700> yourself<00:03:54.090> with

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
your target you can equip yourself with

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.300 
your target you can equip yourself with
the<00:03:54.329> pld<00:03:54.810> I've<00:03:55.019> talked<00:03:55.769> about<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.130> before

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the pld I've talked about this before

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.520 
the pld I've talked about this before
but<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.000> pld<00:03:57.420> while<00:03:57.690> also<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.260> laser

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
but the pld while also is a laser

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.500 
but the pld while also is a laser
designator<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.730> also<00:03:59.910> act<00:04:00.269> as<00:04:00.450> a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
designator it can also act as a

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.509 
designator it can also act as a
rangefinder<00:04:00.870> it'll<00:04:01.769> tell<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.340> actual

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
rangefinder it'll tell you the actual

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.699 
rangefinder it'll tell you the actual
distance<00:04:03.120> away<00:04:03.269> you're<00:04:03.569> from<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.870> target<00:04:04.109> so

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
distance away you're from the target so

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.220 
distance away you're from the target so
it<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.489> very<00:04:05.819> useful<00:04:06.030> tool<00:04:06.480> for<00:04:06.510> zeroing

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
it is a very useful tool for zeroing

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.229 
it is a very useful tool for zeroing
another<00:04:08.220> thing<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.549> want<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.730> talk<00:04:08.849> about<00:04:08.910> is

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
another thing I want to talk about is

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.789 
another thing I want to talk about is
the<00:04:09.389> scope<00:04:09.599> glint<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.349> is<00:04:10.500> still<00:04:10.739> in

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
the scope glint it is still in

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.530 
the scope glint it is still in
battlefield<00:04:11.190> 4<00:04:11.220> but<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:12.000> not<00:04:12.180> as<00:04:12.359> powerful

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
battlefield 4 but it is not as powerful

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.050 
battlefield 4 but it is not as powerful
as<00:04:12.840> battlefield<00:04:13.260> 3<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.739> battlefield<00:04:14.579> 3<00:04:14.639> you

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
as battlefield 3 in battlefield 3 you

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.969 
as battlefield 3 in battlefield 3 you
can<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.540> scope<00:04:15.780> clinic<00:04:16.139> austell<00:04:16.560> map<00:04:16.769> it

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
can see the scope clinic austell map it

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.129 
can see the scope clinic austell map it
makes<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.729> impossible<00:04:17.940> for<00:04:18.419> stealth<00:04:18.690> sniping

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
makes it impossible for stealth sniping

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.990 
makes it impossible for stealth sniping
but<00:04:19.470> now<00:04:19.680> they<00:04:19.859> turn<00:04:20.039> it<00:04:20.160> down<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.609> looks<00:04:20.820> less

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
but now they turn it down it looks less

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.630 
but now they turn it down it looks less
visible<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.630> do<00:04:22.320> wish<00:04:22.830> they<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.190> some<00:04:23.400> sort<00:04:23.580> of

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
visible I do wish they have some sort of

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.640 
visible I do wish they have some sort of
attachment<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.479> which<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.990> sacrifice<00:04:25.500> a

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
attachment in which you sacrifice a

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.480 
attachment in which you sacrifice a
really<00:04:25.950> important

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
really important

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.159 
really important
attachment<00:04:26.849> for<00:04:27.060> something<00:04:27.419> that<00:04:27.660> prevents

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
attachment for something that prevents

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.080 
attachment for something that prevents
the<00:04:28.319> scope<00:04:28.530> Glenn<00:04:28.800> it'll<00:04:29.520> be<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.639> very<00:04:29.910> useful

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
the scope Glenn it'll be a very useful

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.960 
the scope Glenn it'll be a very useful
tool<00:04:30.539> and<00:04:30.840> I'll<00:04:30.930> definitely<00:04:31.169> use<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.560> as<00:04:31.970> more

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
tool and I'll definitely use it as more

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.219 
tool and I'll definitely use it as more
information<00:04:33.000> comes<00:04:33.449> out<00:04:33.780> for<00:04:33.930> these<00:04:34.050> bolt
