Fender amp emulator pedals and modeled
after<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.400> basement<00:00:09.179> amplifier<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.860> put

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
after the basement amplifier and I put

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.640 
after the basement amplifier and I put
up<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.280> quick<00:00:11.490> video<00:00:11.790> about<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.410> about<00:00:13.410> two

but<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> hope<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.509> try<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:15.929> out<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.260> little<00:00:16.440> more

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
but I hope you try it out a little more

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.820 
but I hope you try it out a little more
now<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> I'm<00:00:17.580> playing<00:00:17.820> through<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> vox<00:00:19.400> ac30

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
now and I'm playing through a vox ac30

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.400 
now and I'm playing through a vox ac30
which<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.949> right<00:00:23.130> there<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.109> what<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.230> going

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
which is right there and what I'm going

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.960 
which is right there and what I'm going
to<00:00:25.470> try<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.800> do<00:00:25.949> right<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.640> keep<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
to try and do right now is keep the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.490 
to try and do right now is keep the
volume<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> pedal<00:00:27.930> no<00:00:28.080> different<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
volume of the pedal no different to the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
volume of the pedal no different to the
act<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> doesn't<00:00:29.310> sound<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.760> such<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> huge

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
act so it doesn't sound like such a huge

00:00:30.240 --> 00:01:04.850 
act so it doesn't sound like such a huge
difference<00:00:30.689> so<00:01:02.329> let's<00:01:03.329> turn<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> bass<00:01:04.619> back

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
difference so let's turn the bass back

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:14.539 
difference so let's turn the bass back
and<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> treble<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:12.740> fullness<00:01:13.740> so

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and the treble up a bit fullness so

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.940 
and the treble up a bit fullness so
let's<00:01:15.180> crack<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> bass<00:01:15.750> back<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
let's crack the bass back up there a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:02:14.740 
let's crack the bass back up there a
middle<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> presence<00:01:18.030> knob<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.360> left

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:04:04.020 

let's<00:02:15.230> check<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.560> media

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.650 

I<00:04:09.370> know<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.489> reckon<00:04:10.819> this<00:04:10.910> thing's<00:04:11.150> pretty<00:04:11.390> good

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
I know I reckon this thing's pretty good

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.539 
I know I reckon this thing's pretty good
I<00:04:11.690> mean<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:12.110> sounds<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:14.269> me<00:04:14.300> like<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:15.549> basement

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
I mean it sounds to me like a basement

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.710 
I mean it sounds to me like a basement
amp<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:19.010> know<00:04:19.130> being<00:04:19.400> pushed<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.389> I<00:04:20.450> think

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
amp you know being pushed and I think

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.510 
amp you know being pushed and I think
it's<00:04:20.870> actually<00:04:21.200> tried<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:22.100> could<00:04:22.280> be<00:04:22.370> wrong

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
it's actually tried to I could be wrong

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.950 
it's actually tried to I could be wrong
but<00:04:22.669> I<00:04:22.729> think<00:04:22.790> it's<00:04:23.060> trying<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> emulate<00:04:23.780> like

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
but I think it's trying to emulate like

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.080 
but I think it's trying to emulate like
even<00:04:24.889> sort<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.160> like<00:04:25.250> cabinet<00:04:25.669> rattle<00:04:26.000> and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
even sort of like cabinet rattle and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.590 
even sort of like cabinet rattle and
stuff<00:04:27.430> because<00:04:28.430> those<00:04:28.550> amps<00:04:28.880> have<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.210> tendency

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
stuff because those amps have a tendency

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.659 
stuff because those amps have a tendency
once<00:04:29.840> they<00:04:29.990> get<00:04:30.200> gone<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.830> kind<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.160> vibrate<00:04:31.639> a

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
once they get gone to kind of vibrate a

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.969 
once they get gone to kind of vibrate a
bit<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.479> think<00:04:33.410> maybe<00:04:33.530> that's<00:04:33.770> what

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
bit and I think maybe that's what

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.500 
bit and I think maybe that's what
they've<00:04:34.130> gone<00:04:34.310> for<00:04:34.550> with<00:04:34.729> this<00:04:34.880> as<00:04:35.090> well<00:04:35.300> it

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
they've gone for with this as well it

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.240 
they've gone for with this as well it
sort<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.780> feels<00:04:36.410> like<00:04:36.530> at<00:04:36.650> emulating<00:04:37.130> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
sort of feels like at emulating the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.879 
sort of feels like at emulating the
entire<00:04:37.580> sound<00:04:37.940> not<00:04:38.120> just<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.650> what<00:04:39.650> would<00:04:39.740> be

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
entire sound not just the what would be

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.800 
entire sound not just the what would be
coming<00:04:40.070> out<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.460> speaker<00:04:40.910> I<00:04:41.120> only<00:04:41.600> got<00:04:41.690> an

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
coming out of the speaker I only got an

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.090 
coming out of the speaker I only got an
AC<00:04:42.520> adapter<00:04:43.520> on<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.000> back<00:04:44.919> standard<00:04:45.919> boss

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
AC adapter on the back standard boss

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.280 
AC adapter on the back standard boss
pedal<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.580> can<00:04:46.729> just<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.210> know<00:04:47.270> open<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.200> up

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
pedal you can just you know open it up

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.629 
pedal you can just you know open it up
here<00:04:48.440> put<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.650> battery<00:04:48.889> in<00:04:51.250> it's<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.340> metal

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
here put a battery in it's a metal

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.560 
here put a battery in it's a metal
construction<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:54.260> feels<00:04:54.500> kind<00:04:54.770> of<00:04:54.830> like<00:04:55.570> feels

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
construction it feels kind of like feels

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.240 
construction it feels kind of like feels
little<00:04:56.780> different<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.229> metal<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.680> think<00:04:58.039> it<00:04:58.130> is

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
little different to metal I think it is

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.540 
little different to metal I think it is
it's<00:04:58.430> like<00:04:58.580> an<00:04:58.729> weird<00:04:59.510> sort<00:04:59.780> of<00:05:00.370> one<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.460> those

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
it's like an weird sort of one of those

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.850 
it's like an weird sort of one of those
in-between<00:05:01.900> materials<00:05:02.990> almost<00:05:03.470> feels<00:05:03.680> like<00:05:03.740> a

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
in-between materials almost feels like a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.129 
in-between materials almost feels like a
fiberglass<00:05:04.490> but<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.450> is<00:05:05.660> metal<00:05:06.020> but<00:05:07.990> we<00:05:08.990> can

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
fiberglass but it is metal but we can

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.870 
fiberglass but it is metal but we can
double<00:05:09.410> check<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.770> actually<00:05:09.889> let's<00:05:10.820> just

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
double check that actually let's just

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.409 
double check that actually let's just
