the nikon DSLR range

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.180 
the nikon DSLR range
it<00:00:07.950> replaces<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.550> D<00:00:08.790> 5000<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.920> kind<00:00:11.130> of

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
it replaces the D 5000 and it kind of

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.190 
it replaces the D 5000 and it kind of
falls<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.759> some<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> theme<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.110> D

falls on some of the theme that the D
5000<00:00:13.799> started<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.880> one<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> first<00:00:15.480> things

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.200 
5000 started so one of the first things
is<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.049> looked<00:00:16.170> lovely<00:00:16.529> 3-inch<00:00:17.100> monitor<00:00:18.029> now

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
is we looked lovely 3-inch monitor now

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.359 
is we looked lovely 3-inch monitor now
like<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.630> comes<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:19.140> which<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:19.949> bigger<00:00:20.220> than

live view becoming an important feature

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.400 
live view becoming an important feature
especially<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> video<00:00:50.820> capture<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:52.289> D

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
especially for the video capture the D

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
especially for the video capture the D
50-100<00:00:53.570> captures<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.690> 1080p<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> go<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> 30

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
50-100 captures at 1080p it can go to 30

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
50-100 captures at 1080p it can go to 30
frames<00:00:57.120> per<00:00:57.360> second<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> also<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.550> 20

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
frames per second and also it will do 20

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.049

minutes<00:01:00.059> worth<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.480> video<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:02.280> gave<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
minutes worth of video so it gave the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.090 
minutes worth of video so it gave the
place<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> 5000<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.710> quite<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.010> few

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
place in the 5000 it's got quite a few

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.440 
place in the 5000 it's got quite a few
more<00:01:06.090> features<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.110> sense<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:09.090> terms<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
more features in that sense in terms of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.130 
more features in that sense in terms of
ergonomics<00:01:09.600> further<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:12.180> record<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
ergonomics further the to record the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200 
ergonomics further the to record the
movie<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.010> there's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> new<00:01:14.520> button<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:15.060> up

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
movie now there's a new button just up

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.810 
movie now there's a new button just up
here<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.530> instead<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.250> being<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
here this is instead of being on the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.969 
here this is instead of being on the
back<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> camera<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.799> does

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
back of the camera and this really does

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.429 
back of the camera and this really does
simplify<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> whole<00:01:21.140> transition<00:01:22.140> between

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
simplify the whole transition between

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
simplify the whole transition between
taking<00:01:23.280> still<00:01:23.700> images<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.450> taking<00:01:24.930> movie

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
taking still images and taking movie

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.800 
taking still images and taking movie
images<00:01:25.290> etc<00:01:26.189> makes<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> much<00:01:27.090> easier<00:01:27.390> much

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
images etc makes it much easier much

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
images etc makes it much easier much
simpler<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.400> one-handed<00:01:29.790> whilst

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
simpler you can do it one-handed whilst

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.690 
simpler you can do it one-handed whilst
holding<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.710> either<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> lens<00:01:32.430> or

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
holding that they either the lens or

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.950 
holding that they either the lens or
even<00:01:33.299> possibly<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> screen<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.299> top

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
even possibly the screen here on the top

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.660 
even possibly the screen here on the top
you<00:01:37.170> also<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> info<00:01:37.979> button<00:01:38.220> again

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you also have the info button again

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
you also have the info button again
making<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.450> much<00:01:39.630> easier<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.229> between

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
making is so much easier now between

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.039 
making is so much easier now between
these<00:01:41.250> selection<00:01:41.700> buttons<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.930> all

need very quickly very easily if you
come<00:01:49.680> across<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.189> side<00:01:50.430> we've<00:01:51.240> got<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:52.020> new

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
come across to the side we've got a new

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.330 
come across to the side we've got a new
port<00:01:53.100> which<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.750> d5000<00:01:54.750> doesn't<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.340> which

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
port which the d5000 doesn't have which

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459 
port which the d5000 doesn't have which
is<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.610> external<00:01:57.210> mic<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.350> go

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
is an external mic in and that's to go

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.580 
is an external mic in and that's to go
with<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> recently<00:01:59.869> announced<00:02:00.869> any<00:02:01.259> one

with the recently announced any one
external<00:02:02.159> microphone<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.600> will

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
external microphone so that will
