hi my name is Leah day and welcome to
this<00:00:08.420> video<00:00:08.630> for<00:00:09.020> the<00:00:09.080> free<00:00:09.290> motion<00:00:09.470> quilting

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
this video for the free motion quilting

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.160 
this video for the free motion quilting
project<00:00:10.460> today<00:00:11.120> we're<00:00:11.510> learning<00:00:11.660> another

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
project today we're learning another

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.080 
project today we're learning another
free<00:00:12.590> motion<00:00:12.800> quilting<00:00:13.370> design

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
free motion quilting design

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.870 
free motion quilting design
this<00:00:14.510> one's<00:00:14.720> called<00:00:14.930> crack<00:00:15.530> maze<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.160> the

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
this one's called crack maze and the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.210 
this one's called crack maze and the
inspiration<00:00:17.330> is<00:00:17.779> basically<00:00:18.260> I<00:00:18.590> cracked<00:00:19.040> a

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
inspiration is basically I cracked a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.940 
inspiration is basically I cracked a
bottle<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:19.910> I<00:00:20.570> love<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.080> pattern<00:00:21.560> that<00:00:21.590> it

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
bottle and I love the pattern that it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.589 
bottle and I love the pattern that it
created<00:00:22.279> whenever<00:00:22.579> all<00:00:23.029> this<00:00:23.180> cracking

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
created whenever all this cracking

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.280 
created whenever all this cracking
zigzagged

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
zigzagged

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.440 
zigzagged
out<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.099> I<00:00:25.130> want<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:25.489> try<00:00:25.700> and<00:00:25.970> figure<00:00:26.180> out<00:00:26.329> a

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
out so I want to try and figure out a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.109 
out so I want to try and figure out a
way<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.960> showing<00:00:27.410> that<00:00:27.619> on<00:00:28.040> a<00:00:28.099> quilt<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:28.880> let's

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
way of showing that on a quilt so let's

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.609 
way of showing that on a quilt so let's
get<00:00:29.270> on<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.630> machine<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.169> see<00:00:30.230> how<00:00:30.500> this

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
get on the machine and see how this

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.750 
get on the machine and see how this
works<00:00:30.860> in<00:00:31.070> free<00:00:31.279> motion<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:34.190> I'm<00:00:34.250> working<00:00:34.610> in<00:00:34.730> a

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
works in free motion so I'm working in a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.120 
works in free motion so I'm working in a
little<00:00:35.059> 4<00:00:35.300> inch<00:00:35.329> square<00:00:35.780> today<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.100> a

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
little 4 inch square today and this is a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.740 
little 4 inch square today and this is a
foundational<00:00:37.790> design<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:38.300> I'm<00:00:38.390> going<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.600> get

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
foundational design so I'm going to get

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.460 
foundational design so I'm going to get
started<00:00:38.990> by<00:00:39.290> stitching<00:00:39.650> just<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.040> wiggly<00:00:40.490> line

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
started by stitching just a wiggly line

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.650 
started by stitching just a wiggly line
randomly<00:00:42.470> across<00:00:42.830> my<00:00:43.040> foot

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.590 

so<00:00:47.079> I'm<00:00:47.140> going<00:00:47.289> to<00:00:47.320> break<00:00:47.559> up<00:00:47.730> first<00:00:48.730> this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
so I'm going to break up first this

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.490 
so I'm going to break up first this
square<00:00:50.019> into<00:00:51.780> basically<00:00:52.780> kind<00:00:53.019> of<00:00:53.079> a<00:00:53.170> smaller

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
square into basically kind of a smaller

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.130 
square into basically kind of a smaller
arrangement<00:00:54.250> using<00:00:54.879> only<00:00:55.239> Wiggly<00:00:55.899> lines

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
arrangement using only Wiggly lines

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.060 
arrangement using only Wiggly lines
let's<00:00:57.010> stitch<00:00:57.190> another<00:00:57.519> one

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.160 

and<00:01:01.580> have<00:01:01.700> you<00:01:01.820> been<00:01:01.940> following<00:01:02.270> along<00:01:02.720> with

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
and have you been following along with

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.980 
and have you been following along with
the<00:01:03.260> project<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:04.910> basically<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.630> same

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
the project this is basically the same

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.130 
the project this is basically the same
start<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.430> we<00:01:07.520> used<00:01:07.880> for<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.360> design<00:01:08.720> called

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
start that we used for a design called

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.800 
start that we used for a design called
foundation<00:01:09.830> puzzle<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.210> only<00:01:11.450> difference

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
foundation puzzle the only difference

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.520 
foundation puzzle the only difference
here<00:01:11.900> is<00:01:12.350> we're<00:01:12.830> using<00:01:12.860> these<00:01:13.670> Wiggly<00:01:14.090> lines

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
here is we're using these Wiggly lines

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.410 
here is we're using these Wiggly lines
kind<00:01:15.530> of<00:01:15.680> as<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.830> more<00:01:16.130> than<00:01:16.490> foundation<00:01:17.180> for

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
kind of as a more than foundation for

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.450 
kind of as a more than foundation for
our<00:01:17.450> design<00:01:17.930> we're<00:01:18.470> not<00:01:18.650> gonna<00:01:18.830> fill<00:01:19.280> these

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
our design we're not gonna fill these

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.500 
our design we're not gonna fill these
spaces<00:01:19.640> with<00:01:21.610> spirals<00:01:22.610> we're<00:01:22.820> gonna<00:01:22.970> fill<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
spaces with spirals we're gonna fill the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.280 
spaces with spirals we're gonna fill the
side<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.860> basically<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:26.120> breaking<00:01:26.840> up<00:01:27.110> this

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
side so basically just breaking up this

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.550 
side so basically just breaking up this
space<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:27.950> way<00:01:29.080> breaking<00:01:30.080> everything

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
space in this way breaking everything

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.040 
space in this way breaking everything
down<00:01:30.640> until<00:01:31.640> it's<00:01:32.120> nice<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.540> small<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.960> you

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
down until it's nice and small and you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.100 
down until it's nice and small and you
know<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.470> don't<00:01:33.710> have<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.369> work<00:01:35.360> right<00:01:35.840> off<00:01:36.080> of

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
know you don't have to work right off of

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.270 
know you don't have to work right off of
really<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.310> last<00:01:37.490> several<00:01:38.229> lines<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.680> pretty

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
really the last several lines I pretty

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.980 
really the last several lines I pretty
much<00:01:40.369> hit<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> edge<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.210> my<00:01:41.240> quilting<00:01:41.750> space

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
much hit the edge of my quilting space

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.460 
much hit the edge of my quilting space
and<00:01:42.170> then<00:01:42.259> immediately<00:01:42.880> stitched<00:01:44.170> kind<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.229> I

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
and then immediately stitched kind of I

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.410 
and then immediately stitched kind of I
have<00:01:45.920> all<00:01:46.040> these<00:01:46.190> points<00:01:46.520> basically<00:01:46.910> is<00:01:47.270> what

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
have all these points basically is what

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.359 
have all these points basically is what
I'm<00:01:47.450> saying<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:48.560> don't<00:01:48.710> have<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.950> do<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.190> you

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
I'm saying you don't have to do that you

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.640 
I'm saying you don't have to do that you
can<00:01:49.520> always<00:01:49.729> travel<00:01:50.300> stitch<00:01:50.720> over<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.259> bit<00:01:51.590> and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
can always travel stitch over a bit and

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.430 
can always travel stitch over a bit and
stitch<00:01:54.650> your<00:01:54.860> way<00:01:58.180> okay<00:01:59.180> now<00:01:59.390> at<00:01:59.660> this<00:01:59.750> point<00:02:00.170> I

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
stitch your way okay now at this point I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.050 
stitch your way okay now at this point I
basically<00:02:00.890> want<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.280> look<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.550> all<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.880> spaces

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
basically want to look in all the spaces

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.649 
basically want to look in all the spaces
that<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.479> have<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:04.220> want<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:05.030> crack<00:02:05.360> them<00:02:05.630> I

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
that I have and I want to crack them I

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.690 
that I have and I want to crack them I
want<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.200> fill<00:02:06.710> them<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.070> with<00:02:07.130> even<00:02:07.490> more

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
want to fill them up with even more

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.380 
want to fill them up with even more
Wiggly<00:02:08.600> lines<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:10.340> I'm<00:02:10.519> basically<00:02:10.910> going<00:02:11.209> to

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
Wiggly lines so I'm basically going to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.710 
Wiggly lines so I'm basically going to
work<00:02:11.600> within<00:02:11.810> each<00:02:12.260> space<00:02:13.180> travel<00:02:14.180> stitching

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
work within each space travel stitching

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.740 
work within each space travel stitching
stitching<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.769> wiggly<00:02:16.130> line

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
stitching a wiggly line

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.680 
stitching a wiggly line
Travel<00:02:18.750> switching<00:02:19.050> again<00:02:20.150> breaking<00:02:21.150> up<00:02:21.420> each

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
Travel switching again breaking up each

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.520 
Travel switching again breaking up each
section<00:02:23.510> until<00:02:24.510> they're<00:02:24.780> pretty<00:02:25.230> much<00:02:25.380> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
section until they're pretty much a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.990 
section until they're pretty much a
uniformly<00:02:26.220> small<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.480> broken<00:02:27.960> into<00:02:28.380> smaller

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
uniformly small and broken into smaller

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.320 
uniformly small and broken into smaller
cracked<00:02:30.000> spaces

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.730 

so<00:02:36.330> there's<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.750> good<00:02:37.110> bit<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.290> travel

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
so there's a good bit of travel

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.650 
so there's a good bit of travel
stitching<00:02:38.100> involved<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.760> kind<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.090> keep

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
stitching involved just to kind of keep

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.620 
stitching involved just to kind of keep
the<00:02:40.350> area<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.100> mind<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.880> know<00:02:41.970> move<00:02:42.210> through

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the area in mind you know move through

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.970 
the area in mind you know move through
it<00:02:42.840> create<00:02:43.350> those<00:02:43.590> nice<00:02:45.800> combination<00:02:46.800> of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
it create those nice combination of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.380 
it create those nice combination of
wiggly<00:02:47.370> lines<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.820> will<00:02:47.940> break<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.300> up

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
wiggly lines that will break it up

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.660 
wiggly lines that will break it up
completely<00:02:48.680> now<00:02:49.680> for<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> next<00:02:50.250> space

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
completely now for the next space

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.400 
completely now for the next space
there's<00:02:51.300> only<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:51.750> rule<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.140> I'm<00:02:52.230> really

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
there's only one rule that I'm really

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410 
there's only one rule that I'm really
setting<00:02:52.770> myself<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.280> don't<00:02:53.550> want<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.880> crux<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
setting myself I don't want the crux to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.570 
setting myself I don't want the crux to
meet<00:02:54.990> up<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.530> don't<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.890> these<00:02:55.980> lines<00:02:56.340> to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
meet up I don't want these lines to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.160 
meet up I don't want these lines to
continue<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.210> appear<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.690> they're<00:02:57.810> flowing

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
continue to appear like they're flowing

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.440 
continue to appear like they're flowing
through<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.410> whole<00:02:58.560> space<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.130> want<00:02:59.700> each<00:03:00.000> area

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
through the whole space I want each area

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780 
through the whole space I want each area
to<00:03:00.840> appear<00:03:01.290> cracked<00:03:01.710> so<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.130> don't<00:03:02.460> want<00:03:02.640> these

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
to appear cracked so I don't want these

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.840 
to appear cracked so I don't want these
lines<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.330> meet<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.660> with<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:04.020> lines<00:03:04.260> before

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
lines to meet up with the lines before

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.190 
lines to meet up with the lines before
so<00:03:05.850> I'm<00:03:05.940> going<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.150> travel<00:03:06.390> stitching<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
so I'm going to travel stitching the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.920 
so I'm going to travel stitching the
cloth<00:03:09.710> Travel<00:03:10.710> stitch<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.190> Louisville

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
cloth Travel stitch in Louisville

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.699 
cloth Travel stitch in Louisville
over<00:03:13.739> there<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:16.079> it's<00:03:16.260> fine<00:03:16.409> if<00:03:16.439> they're

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
over there and it's fine if they're

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:17.569 
over there and it's fine if they're
closed

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
closed

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.149 
closed
so<00:03:17.819> just<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.480> -<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.079> very<00:03:19.260> apparent<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.980> you

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
so just so - it's very apparent that you

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.100 
so just so - it's very apparent that you
know<00:03:20.299> everything's<00:03:21.299> crafted<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.930> very

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
know everything's crafted and very

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.580 
know everything's crafted and very
random<00:03:22.920> factored<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.239> sometimes<00:03:24.689> randomness

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
random factored and sometimes randomness

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.860 
random factored and sometimes randomness
is<00:03:25.890> tricky<00:03:26.400> sometimes<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.299> can<00:03:27.420> be<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> little

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
is tricky sometimes it can be a little

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.929 
is tricky sometimes it can be a little
difficult<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.349> stitch<00:03:28.650> completely<00:03:29.340> random<00:03:29.790> in

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
difficult to stitch completely random in

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:50.130 
difficult to stitch completely random in
and<00:03:30.349> freeform<00:03:31.790> now<00:03:32.790> let's<00:03:33.090> work<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.450> this

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620 

that<00:03:51.140> looks<00:03:51.350> good<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.360> basically<00:03:53.360> just

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
that looks good and basically just

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.660 
that looks good and basically just
continue<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.110> work<00:03:54.230> through<00:03:55.010> your<00:03:55.220> watching

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
continue to work through your watching

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.160 
continue to work through your watching
space<00:03:56.050> breaking<00:03:57.050> up<00:03:57.170> each<00:03:57.440> space<00:03:57.860> completely

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
space breaking up each space completely

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.690 
space breaking up each space completely
you<00:04:00.170> can<00:04:00.350> breaking<00:04:00.709> up<00:04:00.860> break<00:04:01.190> them<00:04:01.400> up<00:04:01.550> as

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
you can breaking up break them up as

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.990 
you can breaking up break them up as
fine<00:04:02.150> as<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.450> want<00:04:02.810> for<00:04:03.260> those<00:04:03.380> many<00:04:03.760> lines<00:04:04.760> of

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
fine as you want for those many lines of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.970 
fine as you want for those many lines of
cracking<00:04:05.510> as<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.840> want<00:04:06.110> or<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.620> can<00:04:06.650> keep

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
cracking as you want or you can keep

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.280 
cracking as you want or you can keep
things<00:04:07.250> very<00:04:07.400> open<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.690> know<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:08.870> can<00:04:09.110> fill

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
things very open you know you can fill

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.220 
things very open you know you can fill
one<00:04:09.530> space<00:04:09.860> with<00:04:10.580> just<00:04:10.720> basically<00:04:11.720> two<00:04:11.959> lines

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
one space with just basically two lines

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.920 
one space with just basically two lines
like<00:04:12.620> this<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.370> call<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.150> done<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.690> that's

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
like this and call it done and that's

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.770 
like this and call it done and that's
perfectly<00:04:15.380> fine<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.760> texture<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.390> going<00:04:17.540> to

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
perfectly fine the texture is going to

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.909 
perfectly fine the texture is going to
come<00:04:18.019> in<00:04:18.230> as<00:04:18.680> each<00:04:19.280> space<00:04:19.640> is<00:04:19.880> filled<00:04:20.209> as<00:04:21.169> the

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
come in as each space is filled as the

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.800 
come in as each space is filled as the
lines<00:04:22.160> build<00:04:22.640> up<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.120> don't<00:04:23.419> need

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.500 

I<00:04:25.900> think<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.740> textures<00:04:27.370> really<00:04:27.790> going<00:04:28.330> to

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
I think the textures really going to

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.440 
I think the textures really going to
show<00:04:29.230> off<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.680> stand<00:04:29.950> out<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.520> more<00:04:30.850> lines<00:04:31.240> of

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
show off and stand out the more lines of

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:39.170 
show off and stand out the more lines of
quilting<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.990> cut<00:04:32.230> with<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.410> hat

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.700 

don't<00:04:40.180> be<00:04:40.300> afraid<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.750> move<00:04:41.260> your<00:04:41.440> clubface

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
don't be afraid to move your clubface

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.240 
don't be afraid to move your clubface
square<00:04:42.669> around<00:04:43.210> just<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.660> bit<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.620> can't<00:04:44.980> see

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
square around just a bit you can't see

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.190 
square around just a bit you can't see
what<00:04:45.460> you're<00:04:45.580> doing<00:04:46.000> then<00:04:46.419> you<00:04:46.660> can't<00:04:46.900> stitch

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
what you're doing then you can't stitch

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.140 
what you're doing then you can't stitch
it<00:04:47.380> really<00:04:47.680> easily<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:48.340> it's<00:04:48.580> important<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.060> be

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
it really easily so it's important to be

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.279 
it really easily so it's important to be
able<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.389> see<00:04:49.630> what<00:04:49.780> you're<00:04:49.900> doing

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.719 

come<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.039> work<00:04:54.129> my<00:04:54.369> way<00:04:54.399> over<00:04:54.610> here<00:04:57.569> here<00:04:59.729> so

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
come and work my way over here here so

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.850
