so<00:00:01.709> after<00:00:02.010> several<00:00:02.220> seasons<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.850> telling<00:00:03.120> you

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so after several seasons of telling you

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.880 
so after several seasons of telling you
how<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> race<00:00:03.659> was<00:00:03.870> won<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.380> thought<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.680> might

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
how the race was won I thought I might

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.170 
how the race was won I thought I might
share<00:00:04.950> some<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.490> my<00:00:05.520> thoughts<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:06.060> how<00:00:06.150> to

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
share some of my thoughts on how to

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.089 
share some of my thoughts on how to
watch<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.779> race<00:00:06.930> because<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> little<00:00:07.950> bit

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
watch a race because it is a little bit

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.680 
watch a race because it is a little bit
more<00:00:08.280> complicated<00:00:08.700> than<00:00:09.000> same<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.690> cat<00:00:10.110> video<00:00:10.500> I

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
more complicated than same a cat video I

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.180 
more complicated than same a cat video I
live<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> u.s.<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> hardest<00:00:13.920> part<00:00:14.130> is

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
live in the u.s. or the hardest part is

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.980 
live in the u.s. or the hardest part is
generally<00:00:14.610> finding<00:00:15.059> an<00:00:15.179> event<00:00:15.450> if<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.809> want

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
generally finding an event if you want

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.330 
generally finding an event if you want
to<00:00:16.080> play<00:00:16.230> by<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.440> rules<00:00:16.529> you'll<00:00:17.039> probably

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
to play by the rules you'll probably

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
to play by the rules you'll probably
need<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> complex<00:00:18.119> combination<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.869> satellite

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
need a complex combination of satellite

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.230 
need a complex combination of satellite

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
dish and cable packages but if you

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.730 
dish and cable packages but if you
actually<00:00:21.420> want<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.750> see<00:00:21.900> bike<00:00:22.109> races<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.710> can

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
actually want to see bike races you can

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.470 
actually want to see bike races you can
use<00:00:22.949> something<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.490> proxy<00:00:23.970> service<00:00:24.330> or

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
use something like a proxy service or

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.019 
use something like a proxy service or
just<00:00:24.510> try<00:00:24.990> googling<00:00:25.410> watch<00:00:25.949> live<00:00:26.279> cycling<00:00:26.880> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
just try googling watch live cycling and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.460
