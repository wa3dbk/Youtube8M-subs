00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.980 
worms that could destroy your plants
it's<00:01:15.840> thinking<00:01:16.380> about<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:18.299> kinds<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it's thinking about the kinds of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's thinking about the kinds of
sunflowers<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> kind<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.710> herbs<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
sunflowers or the kind of herbs you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.510 
sunflowers or the kind of herbs you
might<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.700> into<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> garden<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:26.100> smell

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
might put into a garden that they smell

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
might put into a garden that they smell
so<00:01:26.880> strong<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:27.990> keep<00:01:28.229> bad<00:01:28.530> bugs<00:01:28.920> away

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
so strong that they keep bad bugs away

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.450 
so strong that they keep bad bugs away
and<00:01:29.640> dad<00:01:29.970> bugs<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.600> chew<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.680> garden<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and dad bugs can chew up your garden and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.880 
and dad bugs can chew up your garden and
then<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.750> less<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.259> eat<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:36.270> can't

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
then you have less to eat and you can't

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:48.000 
then you have less to eat and you can't
pass<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.490> friends

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.030 

what<00:01:49.010> is<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:49.580> do<00:01:50.510> this<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.780> disgusting<00:01:51.170> yeah

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
what is this do this is disgusting yeah

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.730 
what is this do this is disgusting yeah
yeah<00:01:52.610> it's<00:01:53.240> actually<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.780> compost<00:01:54.260> bin<00:01:54.530> it's

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
yeah it's actually the compost bin it's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.560 
yeah it's actually the compost bin it's
probably<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.460> best<00:01:55.490> thing<00:01:55.790> in<00:01:56.120> this<00:01:56.240> garden

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
probably the best thing in this garden

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.920 
probably the best thing in this garden
because<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.320> helps<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:59.180> be<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.420> fertilizer

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
because it helps to to be the fertilizer

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.290 
because it helps to to be the fertilizer
that<00:02:00.170> we<00:02:00.500> need<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.190> put<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.790> ground<00:02:01.910> to

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
that we need to put in the ground to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.200 
that we need to put in the ground to
make<00:02:02.480> plants<00:02:02.900> grow<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.190> start<00:02:04.670> off<00:02:04.940> by

putting notes or the hosses out in li
the<00:02:08.030> barn<00:02:08.479> well<00:02:09.350> we<00:02:09.679> take<00:02:09.860> some<00:02:10.040> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> manure

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
the barn well we take some of the manure

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.790 
the barn well we take some of the manure
and<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.270> put<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:11.840> there<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.410> we<00:02:12.530> add

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
grass clippings and pieces of oranges

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.470 
grass clippings and pieces of oranges
and<00:02:17.420> things<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:18.020> corn<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.070> cob<00:02:19.430> and

and things like corn on the cob and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.360 
and things like corn on the cob and
things<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.380> would<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.680> discarding

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
things that you you would be discarding

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.000 
things that you you would be discarding
and<00:02:22.580> putting<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.330> pile<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.410> over<00:02:24.770> time

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and putting it in the pile and over time

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.300 
and putting it in the pile and over time
it<00:02:25.430> gets<00:02:25.610> wet<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.209> stir<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.600> up<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.310> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
it gets wet you stir it up and the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.430 
it gets wet you stir it up and the
layers<00:02:28.670> help<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.510> make<00:02:30.820> very<00:02:31.820> rich<00:02:32.240> soil<00:02:32.810> that

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
layers help to make very rich soil that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.350 
layers help to make very rich soil that
acts<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.070> fertilizer<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.060> don't<00:02:35.240> have

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
acts as the fertilizer so you don't have

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.190 
acts as the fertilizer so you don't have
to<00:02:35.480> use<00:02:35.630> chemicals<00:02:36.290> or<00:02:36.709> bad<00:02:37.010> things<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.550> that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.220 

people<00:02:45.200> are<00:02:45.380> what<00:02:45.950> they<00:02:45.980> eat<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.840> they're

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
people are what they eat and if they're

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.610 
people are what they eat and if they're
eating<00:02:48.770> things<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.610> are<00:02:50.890> chemicals<00:02:51.890> and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
eating things that are chemicals and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.440 
eating things that are chemicals and
fertilizers<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.650> are<00:02:55.040> not<00:02:55.850> in<00:02:57.880> harmony<00:02:58.880> with

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
fertilizers that are not in harmony with

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.290 
fertilizers that are not in harmony with
nature<00:02:59.630> than<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> contender

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
nature than a contender

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:12.990 
nature than a contender
I<00:03:08.490> think<00:03:09.490> that<00:03:10.740> organic<00:03:11.740> gardening<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.670> better

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
I think that organic gardening is better

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.710 
I think that organic gardening is better
than<00:03:13.270> using<00:03:13.600> with<00:03:13.900> pesticides<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.920> stuff<00:03:15.720> so

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
than using with pesticides and stuff so
