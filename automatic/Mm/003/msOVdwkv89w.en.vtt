00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
popping or anything like that so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.119 
popping or anything like that so
everything<00:00:40.230> seems<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.559> running<00:00:40.739> quite

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
everything seems to be running quite

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.860 
everything seems to be running quite
nicely<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.969> also<00:00:42.149> wanted<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> set<00:00:42.750> up

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
nicely and then I also wanted to set up

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
nicely and then I also wanted to set up
a<00:00:43.020> video<00:00:43.350> test<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
a video test so then we can see the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
a video test so then we can see the
video<00:00:44.910> playback<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.600> well<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> audio

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
video playback as well as the audio

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.639 
video playback as well as the audio
playback<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.520> well<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:49.020> thought<00:00:49.140> these

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
playback as well so I just thought these

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
playback as well so I just thought these
two<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> great<00:00:50.730> comparison<00:00:51.360> because

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
two would be a great comparison because

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
two would be a great comparison because
a<00:00:51.809> lot<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> guys<00:00:52.410> would<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.710> gaming<00:00:53.100> or

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
a lot of you guys would be gaming or

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
a lot of you guys would be gaming or
