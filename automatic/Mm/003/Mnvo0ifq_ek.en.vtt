00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.850

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.949
 micro sd card can be extended 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.379
 Small special feature is that it is a dual 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.229
 sim device is now visible here 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.870
 you see up here we have 22 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:01:01.190
 reception icons and yes in germany the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.290
 vp is 249 euro we have down here 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.420
 Capacitive buttons here the back button 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.750
 here the home button here 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.810
 multitasking button so follow that 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.430
 android standard good thing on the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.450
 left side here are the bays for 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.770
 the sim cards is on the right side 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.979
 up here the slot for micro sd cards 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.479
 here the volume buttons on the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.479
 top of the power button here the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.260
 headset output on the bottom 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.490
 here is the micro usb output 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.860
 so now I have to enter this one 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.170
 turn a bit back we have a 3 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.580
 10 megapixel camera installed as the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 led flash and this one 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.540
 I hope you can see that is the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.890
 so-called rapid button and that is 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.930
 actually a very practical function 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.430
 So if you look at the rapid 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.490
 button presses then you can do one before 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.500
 start fixed app 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.660
 As I said it was completely free 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.230
 if you press longer it starts 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.470
 automatically the camera app ok that 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.760
 works now works 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.310
 So you can take nice photos 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.530
 directly and you can also with the rapid 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.380
 Button synonymous as a trigger 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.550
 where I have been at the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.830
 camera we have here at the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.350
 Front camera with 2 megapixels dissolves 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.260
 also has an interesting function 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.440
 namely a separate LED flash and 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.580
 this is ideal for people who like to 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.150
 actually take one 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.250
 Practical history certainly will not 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.150
 but everybody uses them sometimes 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.620
 an interesting little update yes that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.320
 it was by and large here again 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.880
 in the attitude and then we look 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.780
 something here for an android version 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.780
 on it is 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.660
 android 4 2 2 the device comes as hsdpa 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.970
 version as I said there is a mediatek 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.830
 processor in it 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.820
 that means you can not stop here 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.520
 to access the lte network but is just 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.390
 a device the middle class uv b 249 euro 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.090
 that will be a bit too 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.370
 cheaper to see so much for acer liquid e 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.720
 3 i am frankfurt android next if 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.440
