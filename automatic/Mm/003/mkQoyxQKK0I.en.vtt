hey<00:00:00.390> everyone<00:00:00.719> so<00:00:01.190> a<00:00:02.190> couple<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.550> days<00:00:02.790> ago<00:00:02.939> I

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey everyone so a couple of days ago I

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey everyone so a couple of days ago I
assured<00:00:03.840> my<00:00:04.020> concept<00:00:04.470> for<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.910> four-way<00:00:05.910> piston

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
assured my concept for a four-way piston

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.940 
assured my concept for a four-way piston
monorail<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.069> the<00:00:08.069> gun<00:00:08.220> master<00:00:08.400> has<00:00:08.760> actually

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
monorail and the gun master has actually

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.480 
monorail and the gun master has actually
got<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.130> working<00:00:11.370> design<00:00:11.840> so<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.340> hope<00:00:14.340> this

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
got a working design so I hope this

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.640 
got a working design so I hope this
thing<00:00:14.670> doesn't<00:00:14.790> mess<00:00:15.059> up<00:00:15.089> cuz<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:16.350> does

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
thing doesn't mess up cuz it does

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.980 
thing doesn't mess up cuz it does
sometimes<00:00:17.039> glitch<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.380> stop<00:00:19.380> working<00:00:19.710> but

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
sometimes glitch up and stop working but

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.370 
sometimes glitch up and stop working but
yeah<00:00:21.990> um<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:23.449> had<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.600> turn<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.960> all<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.289> my

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
yeah um I had to turn off all of my

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
yeah um I had to turn off all of my
graphic<00:00:25.740> settings<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.990> mean<00:00:27.990> put<00:00:28.769> them<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
graphic settings I mean put them to the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.040 
graphic settings I mean put them to the
absolute<00:00:29.789> minimum<00:00:30.029> bacony<00:00:31.340> cuz<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:33.050> wouldn't

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
absolute minimum bacony cuz it wouldn't

00:00:34.050 --> 00:02:02.690 
absolute minimum bacony cuz it wouldn't
really<00:00:34.230> work<00:00:34.649> out<00:00:34.770> boys<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.660> is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.900 

and<00:02:03.700> there<00:02:04.660> we<00:02:04.750> have<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.580> yeah<00:02:07.480> pretty<00:02:08.170> cool

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and there we have it so yeah pretty cool

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.550 
and there we have it so yeah pretty cool
now<00:02:09.910> let's<00:02:10.150> take<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.479> look<00:02:10.600> at<00:02:10.780> all<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.230> wiring

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
now let's take a look at all the wiring

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.270 
now let's take a look at all the wiring
behind<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:13.240> here<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.630> is<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:15.360> yeah<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.810> has

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
behind it and here it is so yeah it has

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.950 
behind it and here it is so yeah it has
these<00:02:18.280> stackable<00:02:18.760> cells<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.540> these<00:02:19.690> are<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
these stackable cells and these are the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.240 
these stackable cells and these are the
main<00:02:20.110> part<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.760> thing<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.530> then<00:02:23.530> when<00:02:24.130> it

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
main part of the thing and then when it

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.910 
main part of the thing and then when it
reaches<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.640> turn<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.570> has<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.140> separate<00:02:26.530> circuit

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
reaches a turn it has a separate circuit

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.650 
reaches a turn it has a separate circuit
which<00:02:28.620> makes<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:30.330> ready<00:02:31.330> for<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:32.200> hover

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
which makes it ready for the hover

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.890 
which makes it ready for the hover
section<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.870> then<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.980> turns<00:02:36.280> again<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.900> it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
section and then it turns again and it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.590 
section and then it turns again and it
goes<00:02:38.200> through<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.500> again<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.430> ready<00:02:40.420> for

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
goes through that again and ready for

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.990 
goes through that again and ready for
this<00:02:40.720> section<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.640> on

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
this section and so on

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.560 
this section and so on
so<00:02:44.670> yeah<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:46.620> pretty<00:02:47.620> decent<00:02:48.490> for<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.330> signs

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
so yeah it's pretty decent for the signs

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.950 
so yeah it's pretty decent for the signs
I<00:02:49.810> guess<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:51.640> definitely<00:02:52.060> be<00:02:52.270> made<00:02:52.450> smaller<00:02:52.870> I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
I guess can definitely be made smaller I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.530 
I guess can definitely be made smaller I
think<00:02:53.230> but<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.880> think<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.330> pretty<00:02:55.420> good

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
think but I think this is pretty good

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.900 
think but I think this is pretty good
for<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.900> proof-of-concept<00:02:56.680> isn't<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.620> yeah

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
for a proof-of-concept isn't it and yeah

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.430 
for a proof-of-concept isn't it and yeah
so<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:00.940> hope<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.270> enjoyed<00:03:01.570> guys<00:03:01.780> I'll<00:03:02.110> see<00:03:02.410> you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
so I hope you enjoyed guys I'll see you

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.150 
so I hope you enjoyed guys I'll see you
guys<00:03:02.680> next<00:03:02.890> time

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160
