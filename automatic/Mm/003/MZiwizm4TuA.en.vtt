fall<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.740> good<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.150> also<00:00:21.300> decide

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
fall is pretty good but we also decide

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
fall is pretty good but we also decide
that<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.199> depends<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.740> how<00:00:23.010> much<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that it all depends on how much you

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
that it all depends on how much you
really<00:00:23.640> want<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.850> spend<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.769> want

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299

good
what<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.890> about<00:01:23.270> 1.8<00:01:25.759> 1.8<00:01:26.759> oh<00:01:27.229> yes<00:01:28.229> lah

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

what what about 1.8 1.8 oh yes lah
yeah<00:01:29.220> anyway<00:01:30.060> looking<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.170> least<00:01:31.320> 250

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
yeah anyway looking at least 250

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
yeah anyway looking at least 250
millimeter<00:01:32.490> G<00:01:32.700> lenses<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.240> look<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.689> or

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
millimeter G lenses they look more or

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.590 
millimeter G lenses they look more or
less<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.229> same<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.909> difference

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
less the same but there is a difference

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
less the same but there is a difference
and<00:01:36.930> moderate<00:01:37.799> apertures<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.430> look<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.909> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and moderate apertures they look kind of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
and moderate apertures they look kind of
similar<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.439> course<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> obvious

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
similar but of course the obvious

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.210 
similar but of course the obvious
benefit<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.329> goes<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> F<00:01:42.930> 1.4<00:01:43.740> thus

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
benefit is that one goes to F 1.4 thus

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.969 
benefit is that one goes to F 1.4 thus
shallower<00:01:45.000> depth<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.450> field<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.740> all

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
shallower depth of field but is that all

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.969 
shallower depth of field but is that all
the<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.149> point<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.630> G<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.020> wonderful<00:01:49.710> lens

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the one point for G is a wonderful lens

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
the one point for G is a wonderful lens
although<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.759> dramatically<00:01:51.659> different<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
although not dramatically different to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.859 
although not dramatically different to
lens<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.590> replaced<00:01:53.040> quite<00:01:54.030> detailed<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
lens it replaced quite detailed when you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.709 
lens it replaced quite detailed when you
stopped<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.290> down<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.360> bokeh<00:01:57.360> licious

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
stopped it down a bit and bokeh licious

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.999 
stopped it down a bit and bokeh licious
when<00:01:58.079> wide<00:01:58.350> open<00:01:59.840> we<00:02:00.840> don't<00:02:01.079> what<00:02:01.200> at<00:02:01.799> one

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
when wide open we don't what at one

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.819 
when wide open we don't what at one
point<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.579> G<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.969> pretty<00:02:03.360> nifty<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.619> think

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
point for G is pretty nifty but I think

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.459 
point for G is pretty nifty but I think
is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> 1.8<00:02:05.490> G<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:06.149> cheaper<00:02:06.180> option<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is the 1.8 G is a much cheaper option so

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.760 
is the 1.8 G is a much cheaper option so
it<00:02:07.649> should<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.890> nifty<00:02:08.099> oh<00:02:08.280> right

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
it should be nifty oh right

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.910 
it should be nifty oh right
see<00:02:10.580> 1.4<00:02:11.180> G<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.740> 1.8<00:02:12.740> G<00:02:13.190> feel<00:02:14.120> very<00:02:14.540> similar

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
see 1.4 G and 1.8 G feel very similar

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:24.390 
see 1.4 G and 1.8 G feel very similar

okay sharp from Center to outside Center

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.390 
okay sharp from Center to outside Center
but<00:04:28.080> compared<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:29.000> 1.4<00:04:30.000> G<00:04:30.180> I'll<00:04:30.630> shut<00:04:31.610> compare

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
but compared to 1.4 G I'll shut compare

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.320 
but compared to 1.4 G I'll shut compare
let's<00:04:35.400> try<00:04:35.699> try<00:04:37.039> 1.8

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.460

back when both lenses are shot at F 1.8
the<00:04:45.710> 1.8<00:04:46.250> G<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.610> actually<00:04:46.909> better<00:04:47.389> around<00:04:47.840> the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
the 1.8 G is actually better around the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.010 
the 1.8 G is actually better around the
edges<00:04:48.409> a<00:04:48.620> bit<00:04:49.009> crisper<00:04:49.939> although<00:04:50.810> in<00:04:50.930> the

edges a bit crisper although in the

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.809 
center they're more equal at f 1.4 you
can<00:04:55.129> probably<00:04:55.550> guess<00:04:56.180> what<00:04:56.479> it's<00:04:56.659> like<00:04:56.930> f<00:04:57.819> 5

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.790 
around the edges with a 1.4 G but 1.8 G
is<00:05:05.180> still<00:05:05.629> slightly<00:05:06.199> better<00:05:06.590> in<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.979> center

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
is still slightly better in the center

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:24.360 
but you see Hong Kong photographer need
a<00:05:13.599> model<00:05:14.599> so<00:05:15.409> a<00:05:15.680> Lambie<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:18.020> stand<00:05:18.440> over<00:05:18.940> over

you<00:05:25.370> look<00:05:25.520> here<00:05:26.800> um<00:05:27.800> laughs<00:05:28.840> this<00:05:29.840> is<00:05:29.990> not

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
you look here um laughs this is not

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:38.409 
you look here um laughs this is not
funny<00:05:30.229> oh<00:05:31.479> don't<00:05:32.479> move<00:05:36.819> but<00:05:37.819> which<00:05:38.000> one<00:05:38.210> has

oh<00:05:49.810> ah<00:05:51.159> you<00:05:52.159> see<00:05:52.340> what's<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.639> point<00:05:52.789> of

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
oh ah you see what's the point of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.300 
oh ah you see what's the point of
pretending<00:05:53.419> to<00:05:53.509> be<00:05:53.629> somebody<00:05:53.930> else<00:05:54.219> it's<00:05:55.219> just

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310

like lenses I mean a 1.8 in one point
four<00:05:58.099> you<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.759> compare<00:05:59.089> all<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.419> like<00:05:59.599> but

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
four you can compare all you like but

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.629 
four you can compare all you like but
you<00:06:00.050> buy<00:06:00.199> it<00:06:00.259> for<00:06:00.529> different<00:06:00.710> purposes<00:06:01.400> will

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
you buy it for different purposes will

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.170 
you buy it for different purposes will
you<00:06:01.729> don't<00:06:01.909> you<00:06:02.979> see<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.099> thing<00:06:04.279> is<00:06:04.310> if<00:06:05.120> you

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
you don't you see the thing is if you

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.619 
you don't you see the thing is if you
really<00:06:05.569> have<00:06:06.020> to<00:06:06.199> have<00:06:06.319> the<00:06:06.469> best<00:06:06.680> lens<00:06:07.629> and

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
really have to have the best lens and

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.930 
really have to have the best lens and
you'll<00:06:08.779> never<00:06:08.990> be<00:06:09.139> happy<00:06:09.520> they<00:06:10.520> might<00:06:10.699> have

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
you'll never be happy they might have

you'll never be happy they might have

the same focal length and look vaguely

the same but that doesn't mean will be

the same but that doesn't mean will be
fair<00:06:15.949> to<00:06:16.099> compare<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.669> two<00:06:16.909> in<00:06:17.089> light<00:06:17.419> for
