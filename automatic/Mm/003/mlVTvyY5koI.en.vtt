 and in advance, we will briefly mention the information Babak Rafati is the referee » 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 There are still remaining tickets for games but we assume that at 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.000
 will be sold out 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.070
 Reus 4 Michael Meier 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.990
 Frank Schäfer and Frank 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.990
 you have that is so please 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.399
 yes, I'm closer 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.740
 the opinion 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.020
 that we worked hard for that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.390
 in the last days with a good feeling in the game go in too 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.630
 can 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.070
 we know 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.080
 that we are with the HSV 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.040
 Of course, against team play the lecturers top team in the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.000
 Bundesliga represents 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.050
 which has a percentage with Sion 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.680
 and the one with the nation offensive area is very very well staffed is the know 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.520
 we 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.610
 and I also think anyone can expect it 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.320
 that here we now this opponent from the first to the last minute in 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.390
 Play land 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.310
 but you can wait 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.610
 is that the team really percent 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.300
 very very self-confident 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.700
 and percent passionate appearance 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.890
 will be next to a lot with from the last 30 minutes against 60 Munich 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.660
 We also know that the team in the comparable play also against 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 Hoffenheim 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 and also played well against Dortmund 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.550
 and Pierre also have the feeling in the coaching team 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.460
 the percentages that we expect percentively to players 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.030
 Also, during the last days, buy and be taken by 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 It takes time for the players, we know that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.590
 but if the believe that tomorrow is there again another step after 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.950
 can be seen at the front and want to bring that on the field
