let's wit that aside and just a quick
start<00:02:38.880> little<00:02:39.390> manual<00:02:39.750> guide<00:02:40.110> over<00:02:40.350> here<00:02:40.500> that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
start little manual guide over here that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.020 
start little manual guide over here that
we<00:02:40.709> have<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.840> let's<00:02:42.840> open<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.650> car<00:02:43.890> itself<00:02:44.250> so

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
we have and let's open the car itself so

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.150 
we have and let's open the car itself so
nice<00:02:45.630> little<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.200> time<00:02:46.470> tapping

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.440 

so<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.490> doesn't<00:02:51.880> look<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.970> actual

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
so it doesn't look that the actual

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.450 
so it doesn't look that the actual
normal<00:02:56.110> PCD<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:59.470> know<00:02:59.500> by<00:03:00.400> this
