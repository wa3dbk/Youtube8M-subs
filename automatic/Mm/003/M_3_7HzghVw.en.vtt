 how to cure the peach bushes the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.180

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:06.610
 let's see them I like them 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.000
 the twig of this peach tree 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.050
 she even crouched so low that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.360
 they weigh I know not much of an ass and so 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.490
 I'm with everyone now that the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.050

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.050
 others what follows 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.390
 so 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.220
 and this is already ending Asia de 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.170
 these on this side 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.270
 now we go to the other side to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.030
 end of legs not uncomfortable 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.400
 because they were here on a roof 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.140
 what we have 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:57.100
 we need hours and paradites in a 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 ladder to be able to record them are 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.820
 several in the bucket 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.260
 as you can see this is another kind of 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.170
 during this is yellow 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.119
 here we have others plus all these not 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.350
 they grew a lot on the other hand 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.350
 it's a little bit bigger 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.320
 as you can see these are of another color 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:28.240
 They are yellow and nothing else to lists 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:31.570
 to download it to see how far there 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.900
 twig and here are others above because 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.360
 I tell them we already raised some times 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.070
 all resist those that are already there and there 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.360
 others that are the half times 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.430
 they are not yet to cut our 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.430
 it's yellow they're to cut them 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.610
 the more 3 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.360
 in the forest to stand up to climb 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.780
 because as it is made for habitat not 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.130
 I reach up then look then 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.750
 as we have just cut our 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.270
 peaches because now I also want 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.430

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.730
 There is my deathbed that also healed her 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.100
 my husband with the lime of the video that they 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.410
 we say and there is the result of 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.910
 our pears has indeed given true 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.550
 but also those guided with little 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.190
 chopped but now it seems that 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.650

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.440
 is 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.290
 this pear is very rich in juice or so nothing 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.030
 more eat it also to bites and then 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.910
 look no more then I'll go right away 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.660
 to make a video of how I make a juice 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.660
 pear with pineapple 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.180
 there they continue showing others as 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.880
 has now given very few but there are years 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.980
 past that has given too much but here 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.980
 on this side it also has enough 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.980
 there are some that are still girls 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.379
 they still need to grow and there are others 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.379
 that are already totally to cut them 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.660
 then how can you see video there are 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.389
 our peaches lie here is my 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.040
 bucket of peaches 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.260
 little color that I say nigel did 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.660
 nothing more and I do not know that they are ready to 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.480
 wash them and occupy them in the code I'm going to 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.389
 prepare in syrup and here is the other 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.130
 kind of hard do not notice how you can see 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.840
 in this in our peaches look 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.540
 look no further 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.620
 with being 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.810
 when you're pretty this is the peach 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.350
 yellow and here we have another type 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.930
 peach is the one that I say crunch type and 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.730
 here it is and how can you see this I'm going 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.160
 to open one and you will see how easy it is to 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.040
 open are still not washed look 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.160
 there's the peach so that's how 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.660
 to be able to eat it is ready, it is not 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.190
 it's washing but since I'm not going to eat 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.170
 the cascarita but if the truth is eaten 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.490

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.490

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.610
 easy to split it like this also 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:39.330
 it's very easy to split it, which is very 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.699
 difficult is that it is very fleshy more and 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.009
 Well, now look, we're going to take them 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.719
