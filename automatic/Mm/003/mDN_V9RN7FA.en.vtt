00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hi all 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 1 this is a tutorial of dragon 5 of the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.150
 dragon channel latin city all the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.970
 Latin rock city group good be 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.460
 I will teach you how to put faster your 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.590
 dragon ' city ​​when you play on a laptop 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.130
 for example as you see now it is very 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.020
 slow good to put it faster today 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.000
 let's do is give right click 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.770
 any part of any island 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.170
 it has to be in every part of any 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.150
 island of all the islands quality and 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.110
 we put down 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.550
 so it's a little faster it was not 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.079
 so fast 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.320
 but it will increase the speed a little 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.079
 you will not be wondering but the inti no 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.130
 it's very fast, it's good that I'm 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.920
 recording with a program 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.890
 and that program like that makes me a little 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.930
 slow the machine at the moment of wanting 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.090
 record and all that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.090
 well that's the least 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.730
 well here on this island also everything 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 all the islands that have 4 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.010
 all have to do to make them go 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 faster but this is recommended 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.900
 for those who play on laptop because 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.840
 normally on those big computers 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.720
 fish like the dragon city ​​is not you 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.540
 is going so slow in changing laptops and because 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.930
 has less video card and ram and 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.630
 those things were some laptops in which 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.710
 they are very few you go the dragon city ​​more 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.890
 Quick 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.280
 good here also in this part in this 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.860
 low quality island 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.440
 well now in the video was not very 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.680
 quick to say but when you 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.680
 are playing they will notice the difference 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.270
 for example the fighting also very in 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.270
 the world of fighting to see 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.540
 how it affects the resolution 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.250
 with the good sale I have now my 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.350
 quality everything low I will put everything down 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.970
 the whole part of the screen we in 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.770
 as to sectors and will divide 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.770
 but all the sectors that you can 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.010
 already good the quality that is in it 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.010
 minimum let's play this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.520
 so they can see how the resolution affects 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.340
 well now they will be able to see how it is 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.010
 look at the edges of this the dragon 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.230
 mirror 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.879
 look when this dragon attacks and when 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.739
 attack looks at a mirror and I'm going to upload 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.739
 the resolution to average as was 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.900
 good 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.720
 right now you see how the attacks do not 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.290
 they go so slow 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.470
 the edges the dragons how does the 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.610
 good resolution now I will attack with 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.610
 my mirror so you can see 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.519
 when they move to attack with low 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.959
 resolution and with high quality with 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.959
 men and that 's quality 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.260
 with this done aurora attack 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.260
 Boreal 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.630
 for just a little bit today is 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.390
 when I started playing good the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.420
 resolution is in half an hour I'm going to 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.150
 put back average quality so that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.350
 see now look at the edges the dragon 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.910
 is it so 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.820
 best 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.110
 But look, the dragon is delaying 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.110
 in attacking 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.850
 how the attack is delayed 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:27.789
 medium resolution imagine yourself in highly 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.610
 it's too much or it does not look sharper but 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:35.090
 it takes much longer and what some 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.830
 prefer is to play faster than 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.139
 resolution does not but it does not affect you almost 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.550
 nothing 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.320
 see how he delayed 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.110
 now again the work of around here 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.330
 you lie 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.720
 how the dragon is delayed a lot in 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.720
 attack 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:13.060
 as Dennis takes too long to attack 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.729
 what all this is doing cast sun only 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.020
 in low the right fastest quality 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.020
 is now going to put it down 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:27.720
 faster with low quality I prefer 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:31.410
 play like that because faster than this 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.150
 dragon attacks much faster than the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.800
 legendary wind normally re against 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.870
 the wind high coloration 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.460
 do not 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.460
 so slow that we say 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.780
 when 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.880
 much more dew 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.030
 the resolution like that the edges are 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.460
 it affects 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.660
 because the inner part is not reduced to 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.400
 the pixels but 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.620
 here attack faster more time 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.930
 there are some who wish to play much more 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.419
 Quick 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.419
 they are not interested in the resolution as it is not 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:28.669
 in my case the case you will see if 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.669
 they want to play fast slow as scene 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.130
 they do not see the resolution 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.130
 not many failures but good 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.630
 I prefer to play like this with not so much 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.270
 resolution because 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:02.420
 everything fights faster and that 's when 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.420
 nice weather this helps me 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.990
 Now I'm going to be scared with a 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:19.969
 well there is the other co does not affect us 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:22.789
 much the resolution the quality but 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:26.060
 on the other, this attack was faster or 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:28.580
 legendary spell that also delays 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.580
 in some dragons 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.670
 now as you can appreciate it is much more 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.690
 Quick 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.690
 simó saves time 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:52.040
 Well I hope you liked this
