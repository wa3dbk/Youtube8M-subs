00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
of rain exchange the spillway aquascapes

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.269 
of rain exchange the spillway aquascapes
is<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> lot<00:00:25.259> more<00:00:25.409> than<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.800> rain<00:00:25.949> exchange

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

algae<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.950> tries<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.190> grow<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.000> it'll<00:02:37.150> be

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
algae that tries to grow so it'll be

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.180 
algae that tries to grow so it'll be
basically<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.630> self<00:02:37.900> maintaining<00:02:38.410> unit<00:02:38.650> okay

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
basically a self maintaining unit okay

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.680

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
out that allow these to drain by gravity

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.160

that's the pump fault you got it and and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.350 
that's the pump fault you got it and and
what<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.710> why<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.250> cap<00:02:57.460> exposed<00:02:58.060> like<00:02:58.300> that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
what is why is the cap exposed like that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.210 
what is why is the cap exposed like that
back<00:02:58.690> grab<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.080> little<00:02:59.260> tiny<00:02:59.500> surf<00:02:59.800> you<00:02:59.980> see
