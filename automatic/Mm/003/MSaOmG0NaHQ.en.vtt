00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
through when they made this game like I

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.380 
through when they made this game like I
think<00:03:40.959> my<00:03:41.110> friends<00:03:41.470> are<00:03:41.620> set<00:03:42.010> up<00:03:42.220> they<00:03:43.150> came

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
think my friends are set up they came

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.810 
think my friends are set up they came
out<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.870> too<00:03:44.049> fast<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.709> agree<00:03:45.070> they

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
out of the too fast and I agree they

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.430 
out of the too fast and I agree they
didn't<00:03:46.030> really<00:03:46.150> need<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.690> think<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:47.079> little<00:03:47.230> bit

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
didn't really need to think a little bit

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.930 
didn't really need to think a little bit
harder<00:03:47.769> next<00:03:47.950> time<00:03:48.100> about<00:03:48.579> what<00:03:48.790> they're

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
harder next time about what they're

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.330 
harder next time about what they're
doing<00:03:48.970> cuz<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.989> m60<00:03:50.470> has<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.620> slow<00:03:50.980> fire<00:03:51.280> rate

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
doing cuz the m60 has a slow fire rate

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.580 
doing cuz the m60 has a slow fire rate
