00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.610 
which I felt like I was right around ten
percent<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:20.480> where<00:02:21.480> my<00:02:21.630> weight<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.200> matching

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
percent and where my weight is matching

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160 
percent and where my weight is matching
up<00:02:22.709> with<00:02:22.770> my<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:24.300> way<00:02:24.480> i'm<00:02:24.599> looking<00:02:24.989> i'm

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
up with my the way i'm looking i'm

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.380 
up with my the way i'm looking i'm
feeling<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:25.980> i'm<00:02:26.220> probably<00:02:26.610> lose<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> little

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
feeling like i'm probably lose a little

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.650 
feeling like i'm probably lose a little
too<00:02:27.690> much<00:02:27.870> muscle<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.640> why<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.270> went<00:02:30.510> in

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
too much muscle so that's why I went in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.370 
too much muscle so that's why I went in
for<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:32.630> sort<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.720> right<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.260> don't

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
