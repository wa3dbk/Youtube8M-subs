a<00:05:33.030> lot<00:05:33.240> about<00:05:33.300> games<00:05:33.570> this<00:05:33.810> season<00:05:34.370> but<00:05:35.370> I

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
a lot about games this season but I

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.180 
a lot about games this season but I
think<00:05:35.730> that<00:05:35.940> we<00:05:36.600> deserve<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:36.960> win<00:05:37.230> when<00:05:38.100> the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
think that we deserve to win when the

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.980 
think that we deserve to win when the
equalizer<00:05:38.580> went<00:05:38.850> in<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.210> dying<00:05:39.480> seconds

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
equalizer went in in the dying seconds

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.800 
equalizer went in in the dying seconds
did<00:05:40.140> you<00:05:40.260> think<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:41.010> worst<00:05:41.510> yeah<00:05:42.510> we<00:05:42.720> were

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
did you think the worst yeah we were

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.180 
did you think the worst yeah we were
drained<00:05:43.080> away<00:05:43.260> we<00:05:43.470> just<00:05:43.650> can't<00:05:43.860> believe<00:05:43.920> that

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
drained away we just can't believe that

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.010 
drained away we just can't believe that
we'd<00:05:44.310> fought<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:45.090> see<00:05:45.270> now<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.450> whole<00:05:45.660> game

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
we'd fought to see now the whole game

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.680 
we'd fought to see now the whole game
and<00:05:46.350> and<00:05:47.340> then<00:05:47.550> they<00:05:47.640> equalized<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.450> at<00:05:48.570> that

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
and and then they equalized and at that

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.090 
and and then they equalized and at that
stage<00:05:48.840> we<00:05:49.140> didn't<00:05:49.350> know<00:05:49.470> whether<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.830> point

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
stage we didn't know whether a point

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.200 
stage we didn't know whether a point
would<00:05:50.520> have<00:05:50.550> been<00:05:50.640> enough<00:05:50.970> but<00:05:56.090> there's<00:05:57.090> some

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
would have been enough but there's some

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.730 
would have been enough but there's some
controversy<00:05:57.510> around<00:05:57.810> about<00:05:58.140> your<00:05:58.320> girl<00:05:58.620> in

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
controversy around about your girl in

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.280 
controversy around about your girl in
the<00:05:58.830> first<00:05:58.980> half<00:05:59.280> I<00:05:59.610> think<00:06:00.450> what<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:01.140> was<00:06:01.230> is

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
the first half I think what it was is

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.230 
the first half I think what it was is
one<00:06:01.950> of<00:06:02.040> their<00:06:02.160> players<00:06:02.370> has<00:06:02.580> passed<00:06:02.820> it<00:06:03.060> back

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
one of their players has passed it back

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.840 
one of their players has passed it back
and<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:04.440> linesman<00:06:04.860> flag<00:06:05.070> for<00:06:05.310> us<00:06:05.400> legacy<00:06:05.790> so

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
and the linesman flag for us legacy so

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.040 
and the linesman flag for us legacy so
it<00:06:05.940> was<00:06:06.030> one<00:06:06.150> of<00:06:06.240> our<00:06:06.330> players<00:06:06.630> but<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.900> ref

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
it was one of our players but the ref

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.380 
it was one of our players but the ref
had<00:06:07.200> seen<00:06:07.410> it<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:07.770> he<00:06:07.860> just<00:06:07.980> wave<00:06:08.190> play<00:06:08.430> on<00:06:11.390> just
