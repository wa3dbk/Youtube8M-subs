00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
hey guys and welcome back to my world

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.450 
hey guys and welcome back to my world
now<00:00:09.840> earlier<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.290> week<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.650> made<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> video<00:00:11.280> on

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
now earlier this week I made a video on

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.450 
now earlier this week I made a video on
setting<00:00:12.210> your<00:00:12.240> worlds<00:00:12.870> spawn<00:00:13.440> point<00:00:13.769> using

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
setting your worlds spawn point using

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.450 
setting your worlds spawn point using
come<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.849> blocks<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.210> such<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.039> yeah<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.310> was

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
come on blocks and such and yeah it was

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.640 
come on blocks and such and yeah it was
a<00:00:17.490> bit<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.789> mess<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.230> there's<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> lot<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
a bit of a mess and there's a lot of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.099 
a bit of a mess and there's a lot of
blocks<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.119> while<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> was<00:00:21.330> preparing<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.869> new

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
blocks and while I was preparing a new

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
blocks and while I was preparing a new
world<00:00:22.350> for<00:00:22.590> tutorials<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.730> completely<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
world for tutorials this is completely a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.009 
world for tutorials this is completely a
blank<00:00:24.779> world<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:26.220> actually<00:00:27.119> compressed

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
blank world and I actually compressed

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.570 
blank world and I actually compressed
the<00:00:28.199> design<00:00:28.500> made<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.800> much<00:00:29.099> more<00:00:29.250> small<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the design made it much more small and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.429 
the design made it much more small and
made<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> much<00:00:30.060> more<00:00:30.210> compact<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.320> whole

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
made it much more compact so the whole

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.610 
made it much more compact so the whole
idea<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.949> actual<00:00:32.430> tutorial<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> take

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
idea of this actual tutorial is to take

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.650 
idea of this actual tutorial is to take
this<00:00:34.950> particular<00:00:35.340> platform<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.510> take

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
this particular platform so just take

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.060 
this particular platform so just take
the<00:00:36.690> small<00:00:37.079> platform<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> blocks

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the small platform and all the blocks

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520 
the small platform and all the blocks
underneath<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.610> drop<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.420> anywhere<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:40.410> your

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
underneath it drop it anywhere into your

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
underneath it drop it anywhere into your
world<00:00:40.739> where<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> want<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.430> spawn<00:00:41.760> point<00:00:41.790> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
world where you want your spawn point to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.110 
world where you want your spawn point to
be<00:00:42.469> okay<00:00:43.469> change<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.489> command<00:00:44.879> blocks

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
be okay change one command blocks

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.790 
be okay change one command blocks
coordinates<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:46.079> done<00:00:46.320> you've<00:00:46.559> got

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
coordinates and you're done you've got

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
coordinates and you're done you've got
spawn<00:00:47.370> points<00:00:47.760> set<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.270> worlds<00:00:48.539> it's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
spawn points set for your worlds it's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.299 
spawn points set for your worlds it's
very<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.170> quick<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.469> easy<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.039> also

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
very very quick and easy you can also

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
very very quick and easy you can also
use<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.850> world<00:00:51.350> as<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> blank<00:00:52.829> world<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> build

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
use this world as a blank world to build

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
use this world as a blank world to build
anything<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.809> yeah<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.289> going

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
anything you want so yeah this is going

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
anything you want so yeah this is going
to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.100> download<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.550> basically<00:00:57.270> how

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to be up for download so basically how

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.389 
to be up for download so basically how
this<00:00:57.870> works<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.230> I've<00:00:58.379> got<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.739> hopper<00:00:59.160> clock

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this works is I've got a hopper clock

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.689 
this works is I've got a hopper clock
running<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> hopper<00:01:02.100> clock<00:01:02.219> feeds

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
running over here the hopper clock feeds

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.030 
running over here the hopper clock feeds
into<00:01:03.000> two<00:01:03.660> comparators<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.439> you'll<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.799> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
into two comparators so you'll see it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.210 
into two comparators so you'll see it
takes<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:06.299> tick<00:01:06.570> per<00:01:06.780> tick<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.070> runs

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
takes one tick per tick it then runs

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.429 
takes one tick per tick it then runs
into<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.610> command<00:01:08.939> blocks<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.780> two

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
into these command blocks with two

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
into these command blocks with two
torches<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> reason<00:01:11.460> I've<00:01:11.549> got<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.909> set

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
torches now the reason I've got this set

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.090 
torches now the reason I've got this set
up<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.600> both<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.650> command<00:01:14.040> blocks

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
up is that both these command blocks

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.929 
up is that both these command blocks
receives<00:01:14.970> inputs<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.630> both<00:01:16.049> ticks<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:17.790> right

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
receives inputs on both ticks all right

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.690 
receives inputs on both ticks all right
so<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.619> redstone<00:01:20.159> torch<00:01:20.430> powers

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
so this this this redstone torch powers

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.490 
so this this this redstone torch powers
this<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.409> that

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
this one and this one this one and that

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920 
this one and this one this one and that
one<00:01:22.799> okay<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.640> run<00:01:24.090> continuously<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
one okay so they run continuously and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
one okay so they run continuously and
then<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:27.770> repeater<00:01:28.770> set<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> three

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
then I have a a repeater set to a three

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.990 
then I have a a repeater set to a three
tick<00:01:29.909> delay<00:01:30.079> running<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> final<00:01:32.189> command

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
tick delay running into a final command

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
tick delay running into a final command
block<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> first<00:01:34.049> command<00:01:34.350> block<00:01:34.530> checks

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
block so the first command block checks

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.270 
block so the first command block checks
if<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:36.329> will<00:01:36.570> teleport<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.439> your<00:01:37.650> score<00:01:38.040> is

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
if it will teleport you if your score is

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.999 
if it will teleport you if your score is
four<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.150> four<00:01:39.360> status<00:01:39.900> equals<00:01:40.439> zero

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
four or four status equals zero

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130 
four or four status equals zero
it'll<00:01:41.790> teleport<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> blue<00:01:42.840> blocks

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
it'll teleport you to the blue blocks

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.039 
it'll teleport you to the blue blocks
above<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.909> coordinate<00:01:45.479> over<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
above now this coordinate over here is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
above now this coordinate over here is
what<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.409> need<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> change<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.310> drop<00:01:47.579> this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
what you need to change if you drop this

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.719 
what you need to change if you drop this
into<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.329> world<00:01:48.600> somewhere<00:01:48.960> okay<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.729> then

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
into your world somewhere okay and then

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.789 
into your world somewhere okay and then
the<00:01:51.030> next<00:01:51.329> command<00:01:51.630> block<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.350> set

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the next command block will then set

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.490 
the next command block will then set
your<00:01:52.979> spawn<00:01:53.310> point<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.850> anybody<00:01:54.119> who<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.509> has

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
your spawn point for anybody who is has

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.310 
your spawn point for anybody who is has
a<00:01:55.530> status<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.189> zero<00:01:56.520> it'll<00:01:57.390> send<00:01:57.780> isn't<00:01:58.259> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
radius of ten it'll set the spawn point

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.490 
radius of ten it'll set the spawn point
right<00:02:01.020> where<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> are

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
right where you are

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.310

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.100 
up there and then last but not least and
this<00:02:05.100> will<00:02:05.969> then<00:02:06.920> set<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.250> status<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.750> so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
come on blocks one repeater and another

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.280 
come on blocks one repeater and another
command<00:02:35.310> block<00:02:35.490> over<00:02:35.760> here<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.660> did<00:02:37.020> do

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
command block over here what I did do

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.230 
command block over here what I did do
though<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.710> popped<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.580> command<00:02:38.940> blocks<00:02:39.090> at

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
though is I popped to command blocks at

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.790 
though is I popped to command blocks at
the<00:02:39.270> bottom<00:02:39.660> here<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.410> not<00:02:40.560> really

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
the bottom here and this is not really

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.070 
the bottom here and this is not really
necessary<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.610> use<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.090> world<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.990> this

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
necessary if you use this world but this

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.530 
necessary if you use this world but this
is<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.680> show<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:44.010> how<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> actually<00:02:45.210> set

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
is just to show you how to actually set

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.780 
is just to show you how to actually set
up<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.350> status<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.920> I've<00:02:47.160> got<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> side

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
up the status that I've got on the side

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.910 
up the status that I've got on the side
okay<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.600> come<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.050> look<00:02:49.200> over<00:02:49.350> here<00:02:49.620> sets

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
okay so this come on look over here sets

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.980 
okay so this come on look over here sets
it<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.370> scoreboard<00:02:51.270> objectives<00:02:51.840> add

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
it up so scoreboard objectives add

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.410 
it up so scoreboard objectives add
status<00:02:52.950> which<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> dummy<00:02:53.610> status<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.240> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
status which is the dummy status and the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.690 
status which is the dummy status and the
display<00:02:54.750> name<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:54.990> status<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.710> then<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.550> one

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
display name is status and then this one

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.510 
display name is status and then this one
over<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:57.240> just<00:02:57.810> sits<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.230> sidebar<00:02:59.070> status

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
over here just sits the sidebar status

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.490 
over here just sits the sidebar status
so<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.730> just<00:03:00.090> sets<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.420> objective<00:03:01.200> set

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
so it just sets the objective set

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.250 
so it just sets the objective set
display<00:03:01.800> sidebar<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.880> status<00:03:03.330> now<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.960> don't

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
display sidebar to status now you don't

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.170 
display sidebar to status now you don't
need<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.710> do<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.190> users<00:03:05.520> well<00:03:05.670> as<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.910> said
