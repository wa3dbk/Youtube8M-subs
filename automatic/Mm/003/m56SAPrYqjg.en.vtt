your eyes adjust to the darkness this

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
your eyes adjust to the darkness this
totally<00:01:21.810> destroys<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
totally destroys that because it's so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
totally destroys that because it's so
bright<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.869> look<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.259> basically

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
bright so if they look at basically

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
bright so if they look at basically
they'll<00:01:26.790> it'll<00:01:27.509> take<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.689> while<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
they'll it'll take a while for them to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.539 
they'll it'll take a while for them to
adjust<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> darkness<00:01:29.070> again<00:01:30.439> sparklers

it's about the same as the desert smoke
in<00:02:36.800> fact<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.250> might<00:02:37.340> be<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.550> little<00:02:37.670> smaller

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400 
in fact it might be a little smaller
three<00:02:40.760> bucks<00:02:40.970> compared<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.510> one<00:02:41.630> dollar<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
three bucks compared to one dollar the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.380 
three bucks compared to one dollar the
only<00:02:42.590> difference<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.190> have<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.940> pull<00:02:44.150> pin

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
only difference is you have to pull pin

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.080 
only difference is you have to pull pin
and<00:02:44.660> don't<00:02:45.590> be<00:02:45.710> fooled<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.190> casing<00:02:46.940> is

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
and don't be fooled this casing is

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.550 
and don't be fooled this casing is
hollow<00:02:47.740> so<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:50.239> know<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.840> really<00:02:51.230> want<00:02:51.440> to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
hollow so you know if you really want to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.120 
hollow so you know if you really want to
pull<00:02:51.770> pin<00:02:51.980> go<00:02:52.340> ahead<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.440> invest<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.830> but

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
pull pin go ahead and invest in that but

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.420 
pull pin go ahead and invest in that but
frankly<00:02:55.780> these<00:02:56.780> are<00:02:57.110> probably<00:02:57.470> better<00:02:58.070> just

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
frankly these are probably better just

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.690 
frankly these are probably better just
because<00:02:58.820> they<00:02:59.000> met<00:02:59.209> more<00:02:59.390> smoke
