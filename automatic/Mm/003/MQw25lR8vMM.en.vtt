got the m6 running right beside it which

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.420 
got the m6 running right beside it which
isn't<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.179> great<00:00:15.419> feature<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.220> can't<00:00:17.220> really

hear it that much as a slight drone in
the<00:00:19.830> background<00:00:20.280> but<00:00:20.460> nothing<00:00:20.820> nothing<00:00:21.390> more

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
the background but nothing nothing more

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.710 
the background but nothing nothing more
than<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.310> over<00:00:23.730> there<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.450> you<00:00:24.540> can

see<00:00:25.020> it's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.620> little<00:00:25.740> lodge<00:00:26.210> that's<00:00:27.210> where<00:00:27.420> you

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
see it's a little lodge that's where you

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.380 
see it's a little lodge that's where you
pay<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.200> sell<00:00:28.800> bits<00:00:29.040> of<00:00:29.190> tackle<00:00:29.640> and

cold drinks and snacks and things and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.349 
cold drinks and snacks and things and
here<00:00:35.030> this<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.269> one<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:37.280> five<00:00:38.280> pools<00:00:38.789> I<00:00:39.059> believe

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
here this is one of five pools I believe

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.669 
here this is one of five pools I believe
I<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.429> to<00:00:41.429> trap<00:00:41.820> pools<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.679> three

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
I think this to trap pools and three

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.959 
I think this to trap pools and three
course<00:00:43.949> fishing<00:00:44.339> poles<00:00:44.609> and<00:00:45.109> this<00:00:46.109> is

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
course fishing poles and this is

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.099 
course fishing poles and this is
probably<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.179> closest<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:48.929> entrance

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
probably the closest to the entrance

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.139 
probably the closest to the entrance
this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.890> called<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> old<00:00:50.550> Paul<00:00:50.909> I<00:00:50.940> believe

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
this is called the old Paul I believe

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.889 
this is called the old Paul I believe
and<00:00:54.589> very<00:00:55.589> well<00:00:55.800> stopped<00:00:56.179> some<00:00:57.179> big<00:00:57.390> carp<00:00:57.719> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and very well stopped some big carp in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.219 
and very well stopped some big carp in
here<00:00:58.640> no<00:00:59.640> reason<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.300> disbelieve<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.870> as

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
here no reason to disbelieve that as

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.070 
here no reason to disbelieve that as
I've<00:01:01.379> seen<00:01:01.620> quite<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> few<00:01:02.420> surface<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.629> them<00:01:03.780> in
