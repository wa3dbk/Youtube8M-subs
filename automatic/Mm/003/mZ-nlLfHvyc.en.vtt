00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.060
 we go 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.449
 how to face it, how often does it happen? 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.449
 preparations must be made when returning 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.570
 what I do know everything you can do 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.039
 the difference between life and death 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.489
 Find out about 18 vortex things 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.589
 polar 1 a polar vortex is the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.899
 circulation of strong level winds 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.820
 superior that normally surround the pole 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.440
 north in a direction contrary to 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.200
 clock hands 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.720
 two 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.400
 these winds tend to keep the air 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.580
 glacial enclosed in the regions 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.320
 Northern Hemisphere Arctic 3 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.870
 polar vortex is at several 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.900
 kilometers of height approximately to 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.150
 the distance flying aircraft 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.070
 4 is a phenomenon that happens all the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.530
 time 5 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.870
 sometimes this vortex is distorted 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.880
 and it moves further south where it pours its 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.009
 freezing air 6 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.079
 the top-level winds that 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.229
 make up the polar vortex change in 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.049
 intensity from time to time 7 when 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.039
 these winds diminish 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.229
 significantly the vortex can 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.969
 distort and the result is a 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.070
 jet stream that submerges 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.289
 deep in the southern latitudes 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.909
 what pushes the cold and dense air of 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.179
 Arctic down 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.179
 8 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 the polar vortex can be presented in 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.920
 any part of the northern hemisphere and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.689
 be it in North America Europe or Asia 9 a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.000
 outbreak of cold air caused by the 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.850
 polar vortex is much more extensive in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.280
 area and duration than a single storm 10 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.080
 with the generalized decline in 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 temperature can develop 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.670
 significant winter storms 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.980
 especially when cold air hits 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.530
 a previously hot region 11 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.140
 the strong cold waves occur several 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.330
 times a year in March 2013 there was a 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.640
 significant decrease in temperature 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.830
 in europe as a result of a vortex 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.220
 polar that penetrated much of the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.580
 continent 12 try not to drive anymore 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.800
 which is highly dangerous 13 if of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.900
 every way you have to drive that the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.560
 vehicle complies with all the rules of 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.660
 security and tell someone 14 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.020
 you must stay inside a place 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.300
 safe whenever possible 15 beam 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.230
 Preparations in your house minimum for 20 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.300
 days 16 locates the hostel more time 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.500
 close in case in your house you 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.390
 present failures 17 never leave only the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.140
 hypothermia can reach you in 10 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.900
 18 minutes when you go out to the street 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.900
