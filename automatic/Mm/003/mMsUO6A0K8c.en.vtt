attractive<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.710> mean<00:00:22.859> that's<00:00:23.010> why<00:00:23.160> models<00:00:23.640> have

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
attractive I mean that's why models have

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.140 
attractive I mean that's why models have
to<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.930> slim<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.560> because<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.609> Apted<00:00:27.029> they

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
to be so slim is because it Apted they

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.790 
to be so slim is because it Apted they

they look better in clothes their face

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
they look better in clothes their face
becomes<00:00:29.250> more<00:00:29.580> saline<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> angular<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
becomes more saline and angular and I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.500 
becomes more saline and angular and I
even<00:00:31.140> had<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> picture<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:32.130> somewhere<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
even had a picture on somewhere which is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.850 
even had a picture on somewhere which is
basically<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.290> face

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
basically just my face

and um at like 13 percent body fat and
then<00:00:38.250> at<00:00:38.370> 7<00:00:38.670> percent<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.300> night<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
then at 7 percent it was like night and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.530 
then at 7 percent it was like night and
day<00:00:39.899> difference<00:00:40.350> um<00:00:40.790> you<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:42.149> more<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
day difference um you just get more that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.090 
day difference um you just get more that
you<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> jaw<00:00:43.590> line<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:43.860> than

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you get more with the jaw line more than

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.459 
you get more with the jaw line more than
angular<00:00:44.430> look<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.600> ways<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.079> get<00:00:46.230> more

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
angular look on your ways to get more

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.660 
angular look on your ways to get more
proportion<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.309> weight<00:00:47.489> like

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
proportion like your weight like

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
proportion like your weight like
especially<00:00:48.149> people<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.629> interested<00:00:49.140> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
especially people that are interested in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.869 
especially people that are interested in
working<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.280> building<00:00:50.550> muscle

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
working out and you know building muscle

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.910 
working out and you know building muscle
and<00:00:51.360> your<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> lower<00:00:51.750> body<00:00:51.930> fat<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.530> way

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and your to lower body fat you have way

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
and your to lower body fat you have way
better<00:00:53.129> proportion<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:54.930> your

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
better proportion on because when your

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.020 
better proportion on because when your
waist<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> smaller<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.949> makes<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.520> shoulders

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
waist is smaller it makes your shoulders

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.540 
waist is smaller it makes your shoulders
your<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.660> chest<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:58.800> arms<00:00:58.829> everything

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
your your chest your arms everything

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
your your chest your arms everything
look<00:00:59.789> bigger<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.840> your<00:01:00.960> muscles<00:01:01.109> will

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
look bigger and then your muscles will

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.959 
look bigger and then your muscles will
be<00:01:01.410> harder<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:02.100> defined<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
be harder and more defined because you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
be harder and more defined because you
don't<00:01:03.090> look<00:01:03.180> fat<00:01:03.359> blurring<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
don't look fat blurring it so just the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
don't look fat blurring it so just the
event<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> mean<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> reason<00:01:06.420> why<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> want

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
event that I mean the reason why I want

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.090

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
really cared um but then if you look at

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.420 
really cared um but then if you look at
like<00:02:18.489> Troy<00:02:18.849> Brad<00:02:19.569> Pitt<00:02:19.900> um<00:02:20.110> probably<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.190> same

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
like Troy Brad Pitt um probably the same

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.979 
like Troy Brad Pitt um probably the same
amount<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.640> muscle<00:02:21.940> development<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.629> just<00:02:22.810> he

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
amount of muscle development but just he

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.330 
amount of muscle development but just he
was<00:02:23.080> at<00:02:23.170> 8%<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.769> it's<00:02:23.920> night<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.280> day

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
was at 8% so it's night and day

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.089 
was at 8% so it's night and day
difference<00:02:25.140> another<00:02:26.140> huge<00:02:26.440> benefit<00:02:26.799> of<00:02:26.860> being

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
difference another huge benefit of being

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.199 
difference another huge benefit of being
very<00:02:27.280> lean<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.819> will<00:02:27.940> make<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.180> more

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
very lean is it will make you more

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.300 
very lean is it will make you more
athletic<00:02:28.780> when<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.709> get<00:02:29.860> rid<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.190> the

videos<00:02:41.579> in<00:02:42.579> order<00:02:42.819> for<00:02:42.940> me<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.239> when<00:02:43.420> I'm

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
videos in order for me to do when I'm

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.360 
videos in order for me to do when I'm
chin-ups<00:02:43.870> or<00:02:43.989> even<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.530> know<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:45.099> one<00:02:45.250> I'm

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
chin-ups or even you know to one I'm

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.069 
chin-ups or even you know to one I'm
sure<00:02:45.489> it's<00:02:45.640> prom<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.120> had<00:02:46.569> to<00:02:46.690> have<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.900> body

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
sure it's prom I had to have that body

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.870 
sure it's prom I had to have that body
fat<00:02:47.319> down<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:48.040> eight<00:02:48.220> percent<00:02:48.489> or<00:02:48.730> less

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
fat down like to eight percent or less

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.000 
fat down like to eight percent or less
otherwise<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.620> relative

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
otherwise it's just the relative

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.259 
otherwise it's just the relative
strength<00:02:51.250> isn't<00:02:51.640> there

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
strength isn't there

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.270 
strength isn't there
and<00:02:52.780> that's<00:02:52.930> why<00:02:53.049> gymnast<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.769> sprinters<00:02:54.250> and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
and that's why gymnast and sprinters and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.089 
and that's why gymnast and sprinters and
Olympic<00:02:55.180> athletes<00:02:55.569> all<00:02:55.780> are<00:02:56.349> very<00:02:56.590> very<00:02:56.860> lean

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
Olympic athletes all are very very lean

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.520 
Olympic athletes all are very very lean
because<00:02:57.640> they're<00:02:58.030> more<00:02:58.180> powerful<00:02:58.599> they're

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
because they're more powerful they're

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.839 
because they're more powerful they're
able<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.739> express<00:02:59.920> their<00:03:00.340> power<00:03:00.579> more

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
able to express their power more

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.460

effectively<00:03:01.390> relative<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.349> their<00:03:02.440> body

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
effectively relative to their body

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.590 
effectively relative to their body
weight<00:03:02.829> when<00:03:03.730> their<00:03:03.880> fat<00:03:04.060> levels<00:03:04.389> are

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
weight when their fat levels are

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.250 
weight when their fat levels are
extremely<00:03:04.959> extremely<00:03:05.889> low<00:03:06.359> um<00:03:07.359> is<00:03:08.139> there

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
extremely extremely low um is there

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.569 
extremely extremely low um is there
anything<00:03:08.530> else<00:03:08.739> we're<00:03:08.889> missing<00:03:09.190> as<00:03:09.310> far<00:03:09.340> as

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
anything else we're missing as far as

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.920 
anything else we're missing as far as
like<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.970> know<00:03:10.000> why<00:03:10.239> would<00:03:10.450> someone<00:03:10.630> want<00:03:10.840> to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
like you know why would someone want to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.599 
like you know why would someone want to
be<00:03:11.019> lean<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.530> mean<00:03:11.829> we're<00:03:11.950> talking<00:03:12.130> more<00:03:12.430> about

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
be lean I mean we're talking more about

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.699 
be lean I mean we're talking more about
the<00:03:12.730> aesthetics<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.180> cosmetics<00:03:13.900> but<00:03:14.230> uh<00:03:14.260> I

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
the aesthetics and cosmetics but uh I

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.379 
the aesthetics and cosmetics but uh I
mean<00:03:15.130> even<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.430> maintaining<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.180> lower

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
mean even just maintaining a lower

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.870 
mean even just maintaining a lower
weight<00:03:16.690> tends<00:03:17.109> to<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.440> as<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:18.250> helping<00:03:18.579> this

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
weight tends to be as like helping this

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.030
