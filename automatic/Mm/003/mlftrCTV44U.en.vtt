hurdler<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.950> has<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> remember<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.420> was

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
hurdler one has to remember and one was

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.230 
hurdler one has to remember and one was
always<00:02:03.840> hoping<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.560> his<00:02:05.250> size<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
always hoping that with his size that

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.960 
always hoping that with his size that
you<00:02:06.899> know<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.799> he<00:02:07.860> did<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> offensive<00:02:08.729> was

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you know when he did go of offensive was

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.120 
you know when he did go of offensive was
going<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.539> even<00:02:10.080> better

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
going to be even better

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.040 
going to be even better
and<00:02:11.460> I<00:02:11.550> think<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.850> has<00:02:11.880> proved<00:02:12.330> he<00:02:12.690> runs<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and I think that has proved he runs the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.390 
and I think that has proved he runs the
same<00:02:13.260> sort<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> ways<00:02:13.710> he<00:02:13.830> did<00:02:13.980> over<00:02:14.190> hurdle

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
same sort of ways he did over hurdle

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.770 
same sort of ways he did over hurdle
because<00:02:14.460> when<00:02:14.700> he<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.150> saw<00:02:15.270> would<00:02:15.480> Matty

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
because when he when he saw would Matty

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.130 
because when he when he saw would Matty
bachelor<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.500> he<00:02:16.620> were<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.860> perfect<00:02:17.220> unison

he<00:03:31.740> gets<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.130> tight<00:03:32.370> he's<00:03:32.610> able<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.000> get<00:03:33.300> you

he gets in tight he's able to get you
know<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.140> other<00:03:34.290> side<00:03:34.500> pretty<00:03:34.710> quickly

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
know the other side pretty quickly

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.970 
know the other side pretty quickly
what's<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.090> watching<00:03:36.270> him<00:03:36.540> oh<00:03:36.980> that's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that's a nightmare yeah absolute

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.660 
that's a nightmare yeah absolute
nightmare<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.709> mean<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.040> that's<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.430> not

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
nightmare I mean but that's you know not

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.330 
nightmare I mean but that's you know not
just<00:03:41.820> him<00:03:42.060> I'm<00:03:42.209> not<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.480> good<00:03:42.800> watch<00:03:43.800> or<00:03:44.010> any<00:03:44.190> our

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
just him I'm not a good watch or any our

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.699 
just him I'm not a good watch or any our
horses<00:03:44.580> but<00:03:45.390> statistically<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.140> next<00:03:46.560> time

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
horses but statistically you next time

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.620 
horses but statistically you next time
at<00:03:46.860> newbury<00:03:47.190> often<00:03:47.520> when<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.760> get<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.510> know

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
at newbury often when you get a you know

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.360 
at newbury often when you get a you know
you<00:03:48.690> get<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> good<00:03:49.140> novice<00:03:49.890> chase<00:03:50.070> when<00:03:50.280> they

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
you get a good novice chase when they

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.690 
you get a good novice chase when they
take<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.610> step<00:03:50.850> up<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.570> doesn't<00:03:51.900> sort<00:03:52.110> of

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
take a step up it doesn't sort of

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.460 
take a step up it doesn't sort of
usually<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.790> ends<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.240> not<00:03:54.480> disaster<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:55.380> it

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
usually it ends in not disaster but it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.110 
usually it ends in not disaster but it
doesn't<00:03:55.709> work<00:03:55.740> out<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.520> setting<00:03:57.000> off

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
doesn't work out you go setting off

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.580 
doesn't work out you go setting off
doing<00:03:57.510> exactly<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.990> same<00:03:58.020> as<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.350> did<00:03:58.440> at

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
doing exactly the same as you did at

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.280 
doing exactly the same as you did at
Kempton<00:03:58.980> yet<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.790> at<00:04:00.030> newbury<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.660> was<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:01.110> was

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
Kempton yet it at newbury it was it was

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.580 
Kempton yet it at newbury it was it was
equally<00:04:02.130> as<00:04:02.220> if<00:04:02.370> not<00:04:02.550> if<00:04:02.820> not<00:04:02.940> more

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
equally as if not if not more

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.320 
equally as if not if not more
spectacular<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.770> just<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.730> think<00:04:05.790> he<00:04:06.120> has

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
spectacular I just I think he has

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.160 
spectacular I just I think he has
improved<00:04:06.840> with<00:04:07.110> each<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.410> his<00:04:07.470> runs<00:04:09.170> whether

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
improved with each of his runs whether

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.860 
improved with each of his runs whether
that<00:04:10.560> was<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:11.850> know<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.120> ground<00:04:12.390> and

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
that was you know the ground and

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.480 
that was you know the ground and
certainly<00:04:13.320> at<00:04:13.440> Kempton<00:04:13.830> was<00:04:13.980> pretty<00:04:14.250> nasty

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
certainly at Kempton was pretty nasty

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.300 
certainly at Kempton was pretty nasty
and<00:04:14.990> his<00:04:15.990> first<00:04:16.290> run<00:04:16.530> at<00:04:16.620> newbury<00:04:16.950> was<00:04:17.100> pretty

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
and his first run at newbury was pretty

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.370 
and his first run at newbury was pretty
soft<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.910> groundout<00:04:18.810> knew<00:04:18.989> where<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.260> next

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
soft a groundout knew where the next

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.640 
soft a groundout knew where the next
time<00:04:19.560> was<00:04:19.710> definitely<00:04:20.930> good<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:21.989> soft<00:04:22.290> if<00:04:22.500> not

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
time was definitely good to soft if not

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.500 
time was definitely good to soft if not
better<00:04:22.860> whether<00:04:23.820> that

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
better whether that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.380 
better whether that
to<00:04:24.750> do<00:04:24.870> with<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.670> don't<00:04:26.670> know<00:04:26.790> but<00:04:27.000> he<00:04:27.150> just

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
to do with it I don't know but he just

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.930 
to do with it I don't know but he just
yeah<00:04:27.750> he<00:04:28.170> does<00:04:28.410> put<00:04:28.920> them<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.220> sword<00:04:29.490> it

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
yeah he does put them to the sword it

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.830 
yeah he does put them to the sword it
looks<00:04:30.120> like<00:04:30.180> you're<00:04:30.420> wrong<00:04:30.570> because<00:04:30.690> we're

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
looks like you're wrong because we're

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.450 
looks like you're wrong because we're
disappointed<00:04:31.170> in<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.890> were<00:04:32.040> quoted<00:04:32.400> as

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
disappointed in you you were quoted as

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.830 
disappointed in you you were quoted as
saying<00:04:32.640> but<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:32.970> know<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.120> might<00:04:33.330> not<00:04:33.480> run<00:04:33.660> at

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
saying but you know you might not run at

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.070 
saying but you know you might not run at
all<00:04:33.990> children<00:04:34.860> no<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.400> mean<00:04:35.700> it's<00:04:35.880> certainly<00:04:36.300> it

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
all children no I mean it's certainly it

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.140 
all children no I mean it's certainly it
is<00:04:37.140> going<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:37.950> very<00:04:38.010> very<00:04:38.430> warm<00:04:38.670> weekend

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
is going to be a very very warm weekend

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.790 
is going to be a very very warm weekend
I<00:04:39.360> think<00:04:39.720> touching<00:04:39.990> every<00:04:40.350> piece<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.560> wood

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
I think touching every piece of wood

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.910 
I think touching every piece of wood
Simon<00:04:41.280> place<00:04:42.120> is<00:04:42.660> going<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.410> start<00:04:43.620> watering

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
Simon place is going to start watering

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.030 
Simon place is going to start watering
the<00:04:44.250> weekend<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:45.560> yeah<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.590> mean<00:04:46.830> ones

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
the weekend and yeah I mean ones

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.850 
the weekend and yeah I mean ones
obviously<00:04:47.190> got<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.490> water<00:04:47.730> when<00:04:48.000> we<00:04:48.120> walk<00:04:48.300> it

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
obviously got a water when we walk it

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.700 
obviously got a water when we walk it
but<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.890> can't<00:04:50.160> see<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.550> going<00:04:51.000> quick<00:04:51.500> at<00:04:52.500> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
but I can't see it going quick at the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.070 
but I can't see it going quick at the
moment<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.580> distance<00:04:54.120> influence<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:54.960> at

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
moment and the distance influence you at

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.600 
moment and the distance influence you at
all<00:04:55.230> which<00:04:55.440> were<00:04:55.590> size<00:04:55.830> are<00:04:55.980> three<00:04:56.130> miles<00:04:56.400> or

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
all which were size are three miles or

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.590 
all which were size are three miles or
three<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:56.940> quarter<00:04:57.060> does<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.420> make<00:04:57.570> any

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
three and a quarter does that make any

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.590 
three and a quarter does that make any
difference<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:58.200> him<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.470> think<00:04:58.770> he<00:04:58.950> stays

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
difference to him I think he stays

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.350 
difference to him I think he stays
forever<00:05:00.600> really<00:05:00.930> um<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.800> think<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:02.460> is<00:05:02.880> an

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
forever really um I think that is an

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.180 
forever really um I think that is an
advantage<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:03.960> him<00:05:04.230> especially<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:05.070> know

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
advantage to him especially you know

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.660 
advantage to him especially you know
going<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.610> pace<00:05:05.790> that<00:05:05.820> he<00:05:06.180> does<00:05:07.160> it's<00:05:08.160> you

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
going the pace that he does it's you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.070 
going the pace that he does it's you
know<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.910> is<00:05:09.030> relentless<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.630> he<00:05:09.840> certainly

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
know it is relentless and he certainly

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.560 
know it is relentless and he certainly
well<00:05:10.590> certainly<00:05:11.100> in<00:05:11.220> his<00:05:11.250> races<00:05:11.700> so<00:05:11.880> far<00:05:11.910> okay

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
well certainly in his races so far okay

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.940 
well certainly in his races so far okay
