00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
front tube by the way now let's go up to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.619 
front tube by the way now let's go up to
the<00:00:41.840> other<00:00:42.840> end<00:00:43.910> here<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> master

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the other end here is there a master

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
the other end here is there a master
cylinder<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.410> need<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> make<00:00:46.710> sure<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.980> have

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
cylinder so we need to make sure we have

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:47.900 
cylinder so we need to make sure we have
this<00:00:47.219> top<00:00:47.460> top

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
this top top

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.040 
this top top
now<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.780> happens<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.260> push<00:00:49.469> our<00:00:49.620> brake<00:00:51.050> we

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
now what happens we push our brake we

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.040 
now what happens we push our brake we
push<00:00:52.320> our<00:00:52.469> brake<00:00:52.829> pedal<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.489> down

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
push our brake pedal right here down

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.490 
push our brake pedal right here down
what<00:00:55.050> happens<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.129> drives<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.350> piston<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
what happens is it drives up a piston in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740 
what happens is it drives up a piston in
the<00:00:58.590> back<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the back in here you can see this

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.180 
the back in here you can see this
movement<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.170> pushes<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.070> there's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
movement it pushes right up and there's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.670 
movement it pushes right up and there's
actually<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.390> T<00:01:06.110> right<00:01:07.110> here<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.470> where<00:01:07.650> our

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
actually this T right here is where our

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually this T right here is where our
brakes<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.299> into

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
brakes are now I'm not going to get into

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260 
brakes are now I'm not going to get into
this<00:01:09.600> too<00:01:09.780> much<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> t1<00:01:11.430> pipe<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> T

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
this too much but the t1 pipe from the T

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.499 
this too much but the t1 pipe from the T
goes<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.780> master<00:01:13.080> cylinder<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
goes to your master cylinder and

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.700 
goes to your master cylinder and
connects<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> other<00:01:16.170> part<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> T

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
connects to and the other part of the T

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.980 
connects to and the other part of the T
goes<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:19.909> brakes<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> back<00:01:21.299> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
goes off to your brakes in the back so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
goes off to your brakes in the back so
this<00:01:22.140> pipe<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.590> four<00:01:23.000> okay<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.119> one

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this pipe here is four okay this one

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
this pipe here is four okay this one
here<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> push<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
here so when you push down on this it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
here so when you push down on this it
compresses<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.330> makes<00:01:27.810> pressure<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
compresses it makes pressure in the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
compresses it makes pressure in the
whole<00:01:28.409> system<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.979> closes<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> brakes<00:01:29.729> off

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
whole system and closes the brakes off

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
whole system and closes the brakes off
in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> back<00:01:30.299> pushes<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> Pistons<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.950> what

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
in the back pushes the Pistons so what

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
in the back pushes the Pistons so what
happens<00:01:32.490> sometimes<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.900> push

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
happens sometimes if you if you push

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.890 
happens sometimes if you if you push
this<00:01:34.470> when<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.250> brake<00:01:35.549> off<00:01:35.900> when

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this when you have your brake off when

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.319 
this when you have your brake off when
you<00:01:36.990> push<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:37.500> it'll<00:01:38.400> force<00:01:38.790> brake<00:01:39.060> fluid

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you push it down it'll force brake fluid

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
you push it down it'll force brake fluid
out<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.470> open<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.070> back<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.250> again

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
out and when you open it back up again

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.789 
out and when you open it back up again
it'll<00:01:41.759> suck<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.180> ear<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.720> ears<00:01:43.229> no<00:01:43.500> good<00:01:43.680> your

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
it'll suck in ear and ears no good your

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.080 
it'll suck in ear and ears no good your
brake<00:01:43.920> system<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.310> don't<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:44.549> any<00:01:44.729> air<00:01:44.970> in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
brake system you don't want any air in

now there's another way to do it that
will<00:03:26.459> save<00:03:26.760> yourself<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.359> little<00:03:27.479> bit<00:03:28.099> on<00:03:29.099> the

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
will save yourself a little bit on the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.240 
will save yourself a little bit on the
back<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.299> this<00:03:30.449> nipple<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.139> back<00:03:31.319> it's

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
back on this nipple in the back it's

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.280 
back on this nipple in the back it's
made<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.519> take<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:32.909> pipe<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:33.840> put<00:03:34.109> like<00:03:34.260> a

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
made to take a pipe you can put like a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.800 
made to take a pipe you can put like a
fuel<00:03:34.620> line<00:03:34.889> on<00:03:34.919> it<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.370> you've<00:03:36.269> run<00:03:36.479> it<00:03:36.629> out

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
fuel line on it and you've run it out

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.610 
fuel line on it and you've run it out
and<00:03:37.109> down<00:03:37.650> into<00:03:37.889> a<00:03:37.919> bottle<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.639> our<00:03:39.629> brake

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
and down into a bottle of our brake

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.949 
and down into a bottle of our brake
fluid<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.359> so<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.449> bottle<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.780> brake<00:03:42.930> fluid

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
fluid and so the bottle of brake fluid

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.740 
fluid and so the bottle of brake fluid
down<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.709> floor<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:44.819> pipe<00:03:45.540> will<00:03:45.659> be

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
down on the floor and the pipe will be

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.059 
down on the floor and the pipe will be
going<00:03:45.870> down<00:03:46.049> into<00:03:46.229> it<00:03:46.439> now<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.709> nice<00:03:46.829> if<00:03:46.949> it's

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
going down into it now it's nice if it's

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.830 
going down into it now it's nice if it's
clear<00:03:47.370> because<00:03:47.909> when<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.269> press<00:03:48.569> on<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
clear because when you press on the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.800 
clear because when you press on the
pedal<00:03:49.370> it'll<00:03:50.370> go<00:03:50.459> blue<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.359> you'll<00:03:51.540> see<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
pedal it'll go blue and you'll see the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.539 
pedal it'll go blue and you'll see the
bubbles<00:03:52.109> popping<00:03:52.349> out<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.829> brake<00:03:53.220> fluid

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
bubbles popping out of the brake fluid

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.580 
bubbles popping out of the brake fluid
and<00:03:53.639> then<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.269> close<00:03:54.449> it<00:03:54.479> again<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.439> way

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
and then you close it again and that way

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.619 
and then you close it again and that way
then<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:55.919> accidentally<00:03:56.699> let<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.239> pedal

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
then if you accidentally let the pedal

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.339 
then if you accidentally let the pedal
up<00:03:57.870> by<00:03:58.590> accident<00:03:59.280> with<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.609> valve<00:03:59.970> open<00:04:00.540> it

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
up by accident with the valve open it

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.199 
up by accident with the valve open it
won't<00:04:01.620> suck<00:04:01.859> in<00:04:01.979> any<00:04:02.099> air<00:04:02.370> just<00:04:02.729> sucking<00:04:03.030> brake

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
won't suck in any air just sucking brake

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.569 
won't suck in any air just sucking brake
fluid<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:04.530> see<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:04.829> it's<00:04:04.949> a<00:04:05.040> little<00:04:05.220> bit<00:04:05.430> more

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
fluid you see so it's a little bit more

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.159 
fluid you see so it's a little bit more
foolproof<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.389> better<00:04:06.569> way<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> do<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.049> no

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
foolproof it's a better way to do it no

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.530 
foolproof it's a better way to do it no
question<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.759> know<00:04:08.879> I'm<00:04:09.120> just<00:04:09.299> doing<00:04:09.479> as

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
question but you know I'm just doing as

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.020 
question but you know I'm just doing as
quick<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.810> dirty<00:04:09.959> here<00:04:10.199> now<00:04:10.379> so<00:04:11.129> basically

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
quick and dirty here now so basically

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.249 
quick and dirty here now so basically
that's<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.389> that's<00:04:12.540> how<00:04:12.689> to<00:04:12.720> do<00:04:12.930> your<00:04:13.049> brakes

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
that's it that's how to do your brakes

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:17.060 
that's it that's how to do your brakes
now<00:04:13.709> that'll<00:04:14.159> work<00:04:14.250> on<00:04:14.400> most<00:04:14.669> motorcycles<00:04:16.070> and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
now that'll work on most motorcycles and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.580 
now that'll work on most motorcycles and
I<00:04:17.970> shouldn't<00:04:18.690> say<00:04:18.810> most<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.079> mean<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.289> don't<00:04:19.380> know

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
I shouldn't say most I mean I don't know

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.839 
I shouldn't say most I mean I don't know
I<00:04:19.620> don't<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:19.949> enough<00:04:20.130> experience<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.639> see<00:04:20.789> it

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
I don't have enough experience to see it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.670 
I don't have enough experience to see it
most<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.599> works<00:04:21.750> out<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.930> lot<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.409> know<00:04:22.469> it

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
most but it works out a lot I know it

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.399 
most but it works out a lot I know it
works<00:04:22.860> on<00:04:23.210> my<00:04:24.210> Harley<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.690> works<00:04:24.870> like<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.200> my

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
works on my Harley it works like that my

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.840 
works on my Harley it works like that my
Honda

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
Honda

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.390 
Honda
work<00:04:26.090> like<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.290> think<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.680> Buell<00:04:27.950> does<00:04:28.250> it

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
work like it I think the Buell does it

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.320 
work like it I think the Buell does it
the<00:04:28.490> same<00:04:28.520> thing

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
the same thing

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.810 
the same thing
the<00:04:29.630> Yamaha<00:04:30.050> does<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.740> don't<00:04:31.520> know<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.700> think

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
the Yamaha does it I don't know I think

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.600 
the Yamaha does it I don't know I think
most<00:04:32.030> do<00:04:32.270> anyway<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.980> can<00:04:34.130> also<00:04:34.250> do<00:04:34.460> with<00:04:34.550> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
most do anyway you can also do with the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.420 
most do anyway you can also do with the
with<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.030> front<00:04:35.240> brakes<00:04:35.480> is<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.750> same<00:04:35.960> thing

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
with the front brakes is the same thing

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.710 
with the front brakes is the same thing
but<00:04:37.430> it's<00:04:37.670> good<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.850> have<00:04:37.940> a<00:04:38.030> buddy<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.450> do<00:04:38.600> it

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
but it's good to have a buddy to do it

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.930 
but it's good to have a buddy to do it
too<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:39.350> don't<00:04:39.380> have<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.680> go<00:04:39.890> pressing<00:04:40.790> and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
too so you don't have to go pressing and

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.100 
too so you don't have to go pressing and
opening<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.420> pressing<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.780> opening<00:04:42.020> all

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
opening and pressing and opening all

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.420 
opening and pressing and opening all
together<00:04:42.230> so<00:04:42.800> there<00:04:43.040> you<00:04:43.130> go

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
together so there you go

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.070 
together so there you go
