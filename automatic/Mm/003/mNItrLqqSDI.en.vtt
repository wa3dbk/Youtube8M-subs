00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.460
 to achieve this trick I was 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.309
 a movement inspired by the baroque 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.440
 cultural of the seventeenth eighteenth century that 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.600
 had as its key point the originality and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.360
 luxury a preciousness that often 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.830
 resulted in wanted redundancy and is for 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.970
 this that decided to make the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.100
 eye makeup 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.589
 using a luxurious single color e 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.780
 gorgeous as an exceptional blitz 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.360
 golden attack an aldo rock 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.340
 hyperpigmented and with a soft texture e 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.129
 easy to use for the mobile eyelid and 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.379
 to blend into the fold of the gold eye 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.940
 as one of the most colorful materials 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.950
 used during the period of 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.690
 first I spread it over the whole baroque 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.640
 mobile eyelid and also in the part 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.850
 lower eye and later 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.700
 los a smoke up to the eyebrows a poet 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.420
 of the time he told them from a color of 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.149
 beauty even to ugliness and I think well 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.950
 that this concept is worth so much 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.110
 in art as in make up stage have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.259
 widespread blitz all around mine 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.540
 eye i go to get eyeliner included 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.890
 in the different palette and with it I go 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.920
 to create liner lines 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.479
 graphics that go to contrast but 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.950
 at the same time they combine 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.290
 perfectly soft 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.729
 of applied eye shadow I realize the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.250
 first line of eyeliner on the eyelid 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.970
 mobile is stretched beyond mine 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.970
 outside corner 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.280
 and subsequently to go to unite 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.140
 an additional eyeliner line this 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.680
 vault made in the lower part 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.930
 of the eye the precision needle in 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.780
 precision eyeliner felt will help me 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.450
 really a lot of in this process 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.610

 things you can use in use 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.420
 of this eyeliner in my case decided 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.090
 to achieve this there corner 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.010
 external reconnecting precisely the two 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.690
 one eyeliner lines in the part 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.310
 upper and the other in the part 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.310
 lower for half the eye 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.370
 eye makeup is practically 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.890
 completed but I decide to accentuate it 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.470
 sfarzo adding golden glitter 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:52.069
 at the bottom between a line of 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.470
 eyeliner and the other with great caution a 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.569
 precision brush I go first to 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.870
 apply a drop of glue and 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.739

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.739
 golden glitter 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.340
 finally decided to add some 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.989
 false eyelashes for the upper part e 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.519
