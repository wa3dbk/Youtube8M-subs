00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
different colors just easier to read

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.889 
different colors just easier to read

oh<00:01:48.689> let's<00:01:49.689> give<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:49.869> some<00:01:50.020> power<00:01:51.090> great<00:01:52.090> gauges

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
oh let's give it some power great gauges

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.620 
oh let's give it some power great gauges
love<00:01:53.049> them<00:01:53.490> I'll<00:01:54.490> show<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.820> right<00:01:55.090> now<00:01:55.149> maybe

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
love them I'll show you right now maybe

the<00:01:55.780> camera<00:01:56.170> could<00:01:56.320> pick<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.560> up<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.979> only

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
the camera could pick it up the only

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.300 
the camera could pick it up the only
issue<00:01:57.549> is<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:59.380> where<00:01:59.560> my<00:01:59.770> seats<00:02:00.130> are

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
issue is from where my seats are

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.630 
issue is from where my seats are
positioned<00:02:01.080> as<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.409> can<00:02:02.619> see<00:02:03.009> I<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:04.570> Sparco

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
positioned as you can see I have Sparco

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.300 
positioned as you can see I have Sparco
race<00:02:06.640> seats<00:02:06.939> in<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.360> bar<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.780> all<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.470> my

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
race seats in the bar and all that so my

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.839 
race seats in the bar and all that so my
seating<00:02:10.060> position<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.720> little<00:02:11.110> bit

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
seating position is a little bit

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:27.500 
seating position is a little bit
unstandardized<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.350> digital<00:02:23.950> display

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.940 

see<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.630> do<00:02:29.019> from<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.350> side<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:29.860> not

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
see if I do from the side it's not

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.559 
see if I do from the side it's not
really<00:02:30.190> picking<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.580> up<00:02:30.700> sometimes<00:02:31.299> it's<00:02:31.480> a

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
really picking it up sometimes it's a

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.900 
really picking it up sometimes it's a
little<00:02:31.840> hard<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.410> see<00:02:32.709> kind<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.610> like<00:02:33.730> that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
little hard to see kind of like that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.710 
little hard to see kind of like that
right<00:02:34.360> there<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.560> angle<00:02:36.069> um<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:37.630> a

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
right there so the angle um just a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.509 
right there so the angle um just a
little<00:02:37.750> bit<00:02:38.290> hard<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> see<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.040> I'm<00:02:39.100> going<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
little bit hard to see so I'm going to

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.570 
little bit hard to see so I'm going to
an<00:02:39.640> easier<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.209> read<00:02:40.420> gauge<00:02:40.780> with<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.680> dial<00:02:42.069> or

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
an easier to read gauge with a dial or

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.729 
an easier to read gauge with a dial or
something<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.480> little<00:02:43.690> easier<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.170> read<00:02:44.349> but

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
something a little easier to read but

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.580 
something a little easier to read but
when<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:45.849> driving<00:02:46.150> or<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> hunch<00:02:47.110> forward<00:02:47.440> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
when I'm driving or I hunch forward a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.110 
when I'm driving or I hunch forward a
little<00:02:47.739> bit<00:02:48.120> crystal<00:02:49.120> clear<00:02:49.420> um<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:51.640> again<00:02:51.670> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
little bit crystal clear um but again I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.789 
little bit crystal clear um but again I
just<00:02:52.180> want<00:02:52.390> something<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.870> little<00:02:52.900> easier<00:02:53.560> to

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
just want something a little easier to

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.259 
just want something a little easier to
read<00:02:54.010> it's<00:02:54.519> one<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.760> those<00:02:54.880> personal

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
read it's one of those personal

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.330 
read it's one of those personal
preferences<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.440> digital<00:02:56.799> look<00:02:57.010> but

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
preferences I like the digital look but

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.220 
preferences I like the digital look but
I'm<00:02:58.090> going<00:02:58.299> for<00:02:58.450> something<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> little<00:02:58.870> simpler

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
I'm going for something a little simpler

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:10.490 
I'm going for something a little simpler
so<00:03:03.810> as<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.989> can<00:03:05.170> see<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.640> really<00:03:09.820> clean

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
so as you can see it's a really clean

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.970 
so as you can see it's a really clean
kind<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.650> hidden<00:03:11.890> look

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
kind of hidden look

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.720 
kind of hidden look
