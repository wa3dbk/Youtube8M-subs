00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.050
 methodology 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.289
 we will indicate when the two players are forming a line 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.989
 from highest to lowest stature 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.480
 the tallest to be number one 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 and the lowest one to be the last of the row 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 as 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 there we go ordered in this way the players 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.080
 we go to indicate them 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.780
 that we are dying 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.380
 that is to say 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.070
 the first player is going to say 1 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.720
 the second 2 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.830
 3 4 hi-5 is accurate 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.930
 until the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930
 last of the players 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.590
 when 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.260
 know what is the list number that corresponds to each one 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 let's tell you the following 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.720
 Players 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 London 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.540
 1 3 5 7 and accurate 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.590
 they are going to pick up a ball 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.120
 where you are 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.580
 since each one of them has its value 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 that's why its rows 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.480
 we are going to form the couples 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.160
 the order of arrival 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.850
 the number one with the number 2 the number three with the number four the 5 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.120
 with 6 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.520
 and so on until you get to the last 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.570
 in the event that the players are lone 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.740
 the instructor 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 will pair with him according to estimated player 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 We will respect the following criteria 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.079
 distance 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.449
 the nobel between 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.929
 couples 17 10 ap 4 meters 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.169
 distance 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.219
 between Thursday 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.509
 it will vary depending on the category 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.779
 of the group 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:39.559
 we can review that in a table attached 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.980
 we will see the following indications for the execution of these plans 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.979
 detest placed 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.489
 the player who has value is going to happen asia his partner 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.769
 it's going to get to you that it should be 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.690
 March 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.999
 the male must go to pay off the ground 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.819
 It is incorrect 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.819
 that the ball if nothing 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:13.969
 chopped 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.919
 and in this path 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:17.999
 that 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.339
 is not correct 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.369
 you should avoid that 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.029
 second 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.100
 the ball denied 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.819
 towards the foot 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.299
 with the psc 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.299
 working 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.789
 yes the ball 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:41.369
 is working with the right foot the boss's partner 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.769
 right football 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 of your partner 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.109
 is not correct 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.940
 or it is undesirable that the ball will liemont type boat 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.899
 to the receiver 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.139
 if he walks away 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.139
 delphi in the receiver that's wrong 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.809
 we must make them observation 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.809
 the man must stay here 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.659
 and ready to be 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.469
 sent 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.999
 another thing 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.509
 the ball 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.029
 comes from mozart 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.939
 well in the leg google well the opposite 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.600
 and the player tried to re-commune with his left leg the 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.879
 ball 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.629
 to the right leg and then send it that too is wrong 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.490
 because it is wrong or any of its actions 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.900
 because that wastes time 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.840
 yes 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.270
 the ball is sent in this way 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.219
 the sector is going to waste a time 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:58.680
 valuable 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.800
 in which they exhibit a rival close 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.879
 at the time of the game 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.979
 was stealing the ball 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.449
 cissé 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.909
 one meter or one and a half meters 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.669
 also with the money of g 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.379
 the opponent comes and wins it at the time of the game 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.210
 if the curator 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.300
 I feel bad 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.909
 with his right leg 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.289
 and it fits your left leg 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.020
 and then try again to rearrange 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.430
 to send the pass that is wasting time 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.849
 which also causes the same 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.509
 what rival can the mud approve us 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.009
 so 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:49.060
 the correct way to sound values ​​that the ball I already made 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.620
 and what bieto in the foot 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.119
 they may be working 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.400
 montiel 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.530
 polti to stay here the ball the player the only thing he has to do is 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.680
 lift your foot 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.110
 and far 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.409
 fall out 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.759
 lira 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.639
 you can send the ball 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.879
 so to a partner 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.589
 so 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.589
 these these computers 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.210
 in it in a recession 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.690
 they are not desirable and they are not practical either then 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.270
 we have to make them see 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.330
 what is the correct way to control 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.119
 a ball 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.669
 However 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.580
 because football is that we do not have a machine 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.180
 stay male 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.630
 we have a problem to make an evaluation an accurate evaluation 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:50.769
 d what is the reception little ball control 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:57.550
 however for some techniques varra walmart numerically this type 

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:00.549
 of injury in this case the reception of the ball 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.680
 the touch of the ball has no problems 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.480
 to specific evaluations to determine the degree of skill with which 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.990
 count each of the players who participate 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.360
 we'll see that in another session
