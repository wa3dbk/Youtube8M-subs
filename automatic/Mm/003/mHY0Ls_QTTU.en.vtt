the<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.650> thing<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.980> need<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.580> measure

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the first thing we need to do is measure

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.240 
the first thing we need to do is measure
our<00:00:30.240> water<00:00:30.480> pressure<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.320> simply<00:00:31.710> time<00:00:31.949> how

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
our water pressure we simply time how

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.069 
our water pressure we simply time how
long<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> takes<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> fill<00:00:33.180> your<00:00:33.360> average<00:00:33.780> nine

long it takes to fill your average nine
litre<00:00:34.380> bucket<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.640> before<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.969> get

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
litre bucket now just before you get

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
litre bucket now just before you get
cracking<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.870> make<00:00:37.050> sure<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.530> tap<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
cracking just make sure that your tap is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:48.649 
cracking just make sure that your tap is
on<00:00:38.010> full<00:00:38.309> before<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> start<00:00:39.149> timing

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.599 

okay<00:00:49.659> that's<00:00:49.960> twelve<00:00:50.350> point<00:00:50.710> three<00:00:50.829> seconds

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
okay that's twelve point three seconds

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.660 
okay that's twelve point three seconds
next<00:00:52.539> we<00:00:52.659> use<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:53.019> handy<00:00:53.530> formula<00:00:54.039> to<00:00:54.399> find

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
next we use this handy formula to find

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.630 
next we use this handy formula to find
out<00:00:54.850> our<00:00:55.030> LPM<00:00:55.719> or<00:00:55.899> liters<00:00:56.530> per<00:00:56.799> minute<00:00:56.949> so

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
out our LPM or liters per minute so

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.539 
out our LPM or liters per minute so
that's<00:00:57.820> nine<00:00:58.210> times<00:00:58.539> 60<00:00:58.989> which<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.549> 540

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
that's nine times 60 which is 540

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.849 
that's nine times 60 which is 540
divided<00:01:01.239> by<00:01:01.329> our<00:01:01.570> time<00:01:01.899> which<00:01:02.350> was<00:01:02.559> twelve

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
divided by our time which was twelve

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.189 
divided by our time which was twelve
point<00:01:03.129> three<00:01:03.189> and<00:01:03.670> that<00:01:04.390> gives<00:01:04.659> us<00:01:04.809> forty

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
point three and that gives us forty

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.109 
point three and that gives us forty
three<00:01:05.439> point<00:01:05.649> nine<00:01:05.799> our<00:01:06.250> liters<00:01:06.759> per<00:01:06.970> minute

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
three point nine our liters per minute

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.330 
three point nine our liters per minute
this<00:01:07.840> is<00:01:08.049> going<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.320> help<00:01:08.530> us<00:01:08.680> decide<00:01:09.070> exactly

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
this is going to help us decide exactly

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.429 
this is going to help us decide exactly
how<00:01:09.970> many<00:01:10.030> sprayers<00:01:10.509> or<00:01:10.780> sprinklers<00:01:11.229> our

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
how many sprayers or sprinklers our

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.410 
how many sprayers or sprinklers our
system<00:01:11.890> can<00:01:12.100> handle<00:01:12.310> now<00:01:13.000> it's<00:01:13.210> really

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
system can handle now it's really

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.359 
system can handle now it's really

lines nice and simple now I'm going to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.139 
lines nice and simple now I'm going to
use<00:01:44.229> these<00:01:44.440> sprayers<00:01:44.830> in<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.189> garden<00:01:45.580> they

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
use these sprayers in this garden they

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.749 
use these sprayers in this garden they
use<00:01:46.390> one<00:01:46.720> liter<00:01:46.959> per<00:01:47.500> minute<00:01:47.649> each<00:01:47.950> I've<00:01:48.340> got

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
use one liter per minute each I've got

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.820 
use one liter per minute each I've got
nine<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.209> them<00:01:49.299> so<00:01:49.509> that's<00:01:49.630> nine<00:01:49.990> liters<00:01:50.409> and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
nine of them so that's nine liters and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.770 
nine of them so that's nine liters and
well<00:01:51.190> within<00:01:51.399> my<00:01:51.550> flow<00:01:51.970> rate<00:01:52.209> so<00:01:52.420> we're<00:01:52.629> good

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
well within my flow rate so we're good

just going to screw straight on to the

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.040 
just going to screw straight on to the
end<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.709> tap<00:02:21.390> now<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> reason<00:02:22.780> I've<00:02:22.870> got<00:02:23.019> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
end of the tap now the reason I've got a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.170 
end of the tap now the reason I've got a
tea<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.500> end<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:23.800> tap<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.250> purely<00:02:24.879> I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
tea on the end of that tap is purely I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.940 
tea on the end of that tap is purely I
might<00:02:25.690> want<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.930> spray<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.349> garden<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> little

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
might want to spray that garden a little

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.530 
might want to spray that garden a little
bit<00:02:27.040> later<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.580> at<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.819> stage<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.420> I'm

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
bit later so at this stage what I'm

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.390 
bit later so at this stage what I'm
going<00:02:28.659> to<00:02:28.690> do<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.080> just<00:02:29.530> put<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.769> stopper<00:02:30.159> on<00:02:30.280> or

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
going to do is just put a stopper on or

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.460 
going to do is just put a stopper on or
cut<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> short<00:02:30.970> length<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.599> pipe<00:02:31.780> there's<00:02:32.319> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
cut a short length of pipe there's a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.500 
cut a short length of pipe there's a
stopper<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:32.980> end<00:02:33.099> of<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.550> we're<00:02:34.480> just

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
stopper on the end of it so we're just

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.030 
stopper on the end of it so we're just
going<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.810> connect<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.200> on<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:35.620> that's<00:02:35.860> for

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
going to connect that on and that's for

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.300 
going to connect that on and that's for
later<00:02:36.280> down<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.580> track<00:02:37.470> yeah<00:02:38.530> little<00:02:39.099> tip

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
later down the track yeah little tip

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.380 
later down the track yeah little tip
make<00:02:39.489> sure<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:39.730> always<00:02:39.879> put<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.269> little

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
make sure we always put your little

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.660 
make sure we always put your little
clamp<00:02:41.019> on<00:02:41.260> your<00:02:41.709> pipe<00:02:41.950> before<00:02:42.099> you're<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.400> that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
clamp on your pipe before you're on that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.820 
clamp on your pipe before you're on that
if<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.690> find<00:02:43.870> these<00:02:44.019> are<00:02:44.080> quite<00:02:44.379> hard<00:02:44.709> to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
if you find these are quite hard to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.070 
if you find these are quite hard to
attach<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:46.090> can't<00:02:46.360> actually<00:02:46.480> dip<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.959> end

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
attach on you can't actually dip the end

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.180 
attach on you can't actually dip the end
of<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.560> little<00:02:47.620> bit<00:02:47.799> of<00:02:47.980> boiling

of this and a little bit of boiling

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.500 
of this and a little bit of boiling
water<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:48.849> going<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.060> soften<00:02:49.269> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
water and that's going to soften it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.360 
water and that's going to soften it
today's<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.930> nice<00:02:50.200> hot<00:02:50.440> day<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.680> these<00:02:51.010> go<00:02:51.190> on

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
straight into that we're good to go

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.900 
straight into that we're good to go
now<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.050> strip<00:06:00.440> line<00:06:00.620> system<00:06:01.039> is<00:06:01.220> absolutely

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
now the strip line system is absolutely

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.640 
now the strip line system is absolutely
perfect<00:06:02.300> for<00:06:02.330> this<00:06:02.539> type<00:06:02.750> of<00:06:02.900> garden<00:06:03.169> because

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
perfect for this type of garden because

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.260 
perfect for this type of garden because
what<00:06:03.830> it<00:06:03.919> does<00:06:04.070> it<00:06:04.280> what<00:06:04.520> is<00:06:04.639> the<00:06:04.789> roots<00:06:05.000> of<00:06:05.210> the

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
what it does it what is the roots of the

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.570 
what it does it what is the roots of the
plants<00:06:05.660> now<00:06:06.229> the<00:06:06.380> trick<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.620> this<00:06:06.830> is<00:06:06.889> you

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
plants now the trick to this is you

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.820 
plants now the trick to this is you
don't<00:06:07.759> want<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.060> actual<00:06:08.360> dripper<00:06:09.050> right<00:06:09.590> at

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
don't want the actual dripper right at

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.010 
don't want the actual dripper right at
the<00:06:10.130> base<00:06:10.250> of<00:06:10.310> the<00:06:10.550> plant<00:06:10.820> you<00:06:11.240> want<00:06:11.449> it<00:06:11.539> around

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
the base of the plant you want it around

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.420 
the base of the plant you want it around
the<00:06:12.199> sides<00:06:12.470> of<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:12.710> plant<00:06:12.949> because<00:06:13.250> that's

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
the sides of the plant because that's

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.560 
the sides of the plant because that's
what<00:06:13.550> we<00:06:13.610> actually<00:06:13.729> where<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.120> roots<00:06:14.300> are

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
what we actually where the roots are

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.689 
what we actually where the roots are
yeah<00:06:15.259> just<00:06:15.530> like<00:06:15.680> our<00:06:15.830> spray<00:06:16.159> system<00:06:16.550> we<00:06:16.669> put

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
yeah just like our spray system we put

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.610 
yeah just like our spray system we put
up<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.060> back<00:06:17.240> it's<00:06:17.960> pretty<00:06:18.080> much<00:06:18.320> just<00:06:18.530> the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
up the back it's pretty much just the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.770 
up the back it's pretty much just the
same<00:06:18.889> all<00:06:19.099> we<00:06:19.310> do<00:06:19.490> is<00:06:19.669> just<00:06:19.880> ping<00:06:20.419> straight

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
same all we do is just ping straight

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.020 
same all we do is just ping straight
into<00:06:21.139> our<00:06:21.319> mainline<00:06:21.800> and<00:06:22.550> order<00:06:22.729> our<00:06:22.819> little

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
into our mainline and order our little

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.430 
into our mainline and order our little
drippers<00:06:23.389> just<00:06:23.720> come<00:06:23.870> straight<00:06:24.139> off<00:06:24.169> that

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
drippers just come straight off that

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.600 
drippers just come straight off that
nice<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:24.770> easy

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.909 

and<00:06:28.690> finally<00:06:29.690> the<00:06:29.840> pop-up<00:06:30.229> sprinklers<00:06:30.740> for

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
and finally the pop-up sprinklers for

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.430 
and finally the pop-up sprinklers for
the<00:06:30.979> grass<00:06:31.250> I've<00:06:31.780> run<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:32.900> source<00:06:33.169> pipe

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
the grass I've run the source pipe

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.050 
the grass I've run the source pipe
around<00:06:33.800> the<00:06:33.889> outside<00:06:34.370> edge<00:06:34.580> of<00:06:34.729> the<00:06:34.849> lawn

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
around the outside edge of the lawn

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.839 
around the outside edge of the lawn
using<00:06:35.690> t-junctions<00:06:36.409> and<00:06:36.620> elbows<00:06:37.039> to<00:06:37.520> divert

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
using t-junctions and elbows to divert

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.390 
using t-junctions and elbows to divert
it<00:06:38.000> to<00:06:38.150> the<00:06:38.270> sprinklers<00:06:38.719> a<00:06:38.930> quick<00:06:39.650> tidy<00:06:39.889> dig<00:06:40.219> to

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
it to the sprinklers a quick tidy dig to

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.249 
it to the sprinklers a quick tidy dig to
the<00:06:40.490> sprinkler<00:06:40.880> position<00:06:41.300> and<00:06:41.509> I<00:06:41.750> can<00:06:41.900> lay<00:06:42.110> the

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
the sprinkler position and I can lay the

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:47.020 
the sprinkler position and I can lay the
pipe<00:06:42.500> back<00:06:42.800> to<00:06:42.979> the<00:06:43.070> water<00:06:43.280> source<00:06:45.669> now<00:06:46.669> attach

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
pipe back to the water source now attach

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.939 
pipe back to the water source now attach
the<00:06:47.060> pipe<00:06:47.360> to<00:06:47.539> the<00:06:47.630> mainline<00:06:48.050> and<00:06:48.349> install<00:06:48.800> the

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
the pipe to the mainline and install the

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.310 
the pipe to the mainline and install the
other<00:06:49.130> sprinklers<00:06:49.630> replace<00:06:50.630> the<00:06:50.810> grass<00:06:51.050> and

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
other sprinklers replace the grass and

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.659 
other sprinklers replace the grass and
it<00:06:51.409> should<00:06:51.620> grow<00:06:51.800> back<00:06:52.009> in<00:06:52.159> no<00:06:52.370> time

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
it should grow back in no time

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.779 
it should grow back in no time
once<00:06:53.060> again<00:06:53.360> turn<00:06:53.810> the<00:06:53.900> water<00:06:54.080> on<00:06:54.199> and<00:06:54.789> adjust

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
once again turn the water on and adjust

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.969 
once again turn the water on and adjust
where<00:06:55.969> necessary<00:06:56.530> now<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:57.590> good<00:06:57.740> thing<00:06:57.800> about

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
where necessary now the good thing about

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.310 
where necessary now the good thing about
these<00:06:58.280> little<00:06:58.430> adjustable<00:06:58.940> ones<00:06:59.210> I<00:06:59.449> can

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
these little adjustable ones I can

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.620 
these little adjustable ones I can
either<00:07:00.469> make<00:07:00.650> this<00:07:00.800> 360<00:07:01.639> degrees<00:07:01.940> right<00:07:02.449> down

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
either make this 360 degrees right down

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:09.070 
either make this 360 degrees right down
to<00:07:02.750> 5<00:07:02.960> degrees<00:07:06.909> and<00:07:07.909> there<00:07:08.240> we<00:07:08.389> have<00:07:08.570> it<00:07:08.599> three

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
to 5 degrees and there we have it three

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.570 
to 5 degrees and there we have it three
