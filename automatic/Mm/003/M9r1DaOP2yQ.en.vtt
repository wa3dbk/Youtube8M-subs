00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.400 
this is a very very good idea and it
could<00:04:14.280> be<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.430> very<00:04:14.700> fun<00:04:15.030> game<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.990> combat

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
could be a very fun game but the combat

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.140 
could be a very fun game but the combat
all<00:04:16.620> comes<00:04:16.950> down<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.160> rock<00:04:17.459> paper<00:04:17.670> scissors

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
all comes down to rock paper scissors

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.680 
all comes down to rock paper scissors
and<00:04:18.360> that<00:04:18.480> destroys<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.709> fucking<00:04:20.070> game<00:04:20.690> all

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
and that destroys this fucking game all

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.050 
and that destroys this fucking game all
luck<00:04:22.290> based<00:04:22.560> no<00:04:23.070> skill<00:04:24.290> drop<00:04:25.290> cast<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:26.670> was
