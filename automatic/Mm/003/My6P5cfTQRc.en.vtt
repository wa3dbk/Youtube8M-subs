00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.480 
here and you guys can see he's just he's
not<00:02:39.959> patient<00:02:40.500> with<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> ball<00:02:40.920> at<00:02:41.100> all<00:02:41.250> he

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
not patient with the ball at all he

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.490 
not patient with the ball at all he
every<00:02:41.820> time<00:02:41.850> he<00:02:42.030> gets<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.450> he's<00:02:42.570> rushing<00:02:42.900> down

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
every time he gets it he's rushing down

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.229 
every time he gets it he's rushing down
passing<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.250> up<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> pitch<00:02:44.670> trying<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:44.970> go<00:02:45.060> for

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
passing it up the pitch trying to go for

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.350 
passing it up the pitch trying to go for
the<00:02:45.300> counter-attack<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:46.140> believe<00:02:46.920> he<00:02:47.100> was

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
the counter-attack I believe he was

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.250 
the counter-attack I believe he was
undefended<00:02:48.360> seemed<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:48.720> he<00:02:48.870> had<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.989> lot<00:02:49.230> of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
undefended seemed like he had a lot of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
undefended seemed like he had a lot of
people<00:02:49.620> back<00:02:49.800> defensive<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.489> counter-attack

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
people back defensive and counter-attack

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.520 
people back defensive and counter-attack
I<00:02:51.120> believe<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.630> tactics<00:02:52.050> he<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.320> using

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
I believe is the tactics he was using

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.120 
I believe is the tactics he was using
but<00:02:53.300> again<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.780> reason<00:02:55.140> why<00:02:55.350> I'm<00:02:55.709> gonna<00:02:55.950> end

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
but again the reason why I'm gonna end

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.060 
but again the reason why I'm gonna end
up<00:02:56.630> he's<00:02:57.630> gonna<00:02:57.810> end<00:02:57.900> up<00:02:58.230> getting<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.560> goal<00:02:58.800> here

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
up he's gonna end up getting a goal here

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.280 
up he's gonna end up getting a goal here
I<00:02:59.100> did<00:02:59.400> it<00:03:00.030> was<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> sloppy<00:03:00.450> passing<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.140> mean

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
I did it was a sloppy passing I mean

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.960 
I did it was a sloppy passing I mean
plain<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.860> simple<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.250> sloppy<00:03:02.400> passing<00:03:02.850> on

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
plain and simple with sloppy passing on

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
plain and simple with sloppy passing on
my<00:03:03.090> part<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.480> he<00:03:03.600> ends<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:03.930> getting<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.260> corner

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
my part and he ends up getting a corner
