snapped in half but this one on my first

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.380 
snapped in half but this one on my first
solve<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.530> got<00:02:44.680> 25<00:02:45.070> minutes<00:02:45.400> which<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.760> better<00:02:46.000> a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
solve I got 25 minutes which is better a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.600 
solve I got 25 minutes which is better a
lot<00:02:46.780> better<00:02:46.840> it's<00:02:47.410> less<00:02:47.980> than<00:02:48.010> half<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.340> time

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
lot better it's less than half the time

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.540 
lot better it's less than half the time
so<00:02:49.480> I'm<00:02:50.350> sure<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:50.710> get<00:02:50.950> another<00:02:51.130> 20<00:02:51.460> to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
so I'm sure I can get another 20 to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.690 
so I'm sure I can get another 20 to
