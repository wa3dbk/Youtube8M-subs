00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
bit kind of oily here and there but the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.200 
bit kind of oily here and there but the
paintwork<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.460> would<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.670> said<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.909> probably

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
paintwork I would have said is probably

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.670 
paintwork I would have said is probably
original<00:01:08.570> I've<00:01:09.570> noticed<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> gauge<00:01:10.470> II

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
original I've noticed that this gauge II

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.140 
original I've noticed that this gauge II
didn't<00:01:11.010> move<00:01:11.130> when<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> rode<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.090> don't

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
didn't move when I rode it and I don't

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.990 
didn't move when I rode it and I don't
know<00:01:12.420> whether<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.280> gauge<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> working<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:14.970> not

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
know whether the gauge is working or not

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.490 
know whether the gauge is working or not
maybe<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.570> didn't<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> engine<00:01:16.290> warm

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
maybe I didn't get the engine warm

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.149 
maybe I didn't get the engine warm
enough<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.600> temperature<00:01:18.600> gauge

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
enough but this is a temperature gauge

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.640 
enough but this is a temperature gauge
it<00:01:20.159> doesn't<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.700> killed<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.509> such<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it doesn't have killed it as such it

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
it doesn't have killed it as such it
just<00:01:22.830> uses<00:01:23.159> oil<00:01:23.340> keep<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> engine<00:01:24.450> cool<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
just uses oil keep the engine cool so I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.780 
just uses oil keep the engine cool so I
don't<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:25.740> important<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.340> anyway

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
don't know how important that is anyway

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.810 
don't know how important that is anyway
really<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.470> also<00:01:28.470> noticed<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.310> he

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
really I also noticed that the he

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.450 
really I also noticed that the he
doesn't<00:01:30.090> seem<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> light<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:31.100> when<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> lights

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
doesn't seem to light up when the lights

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
doesn't seem to light up when the lights
are<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.670> either<00:01:32.880> side<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> them<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> feed

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
are on either side of them was a feed

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.340 
are on either side of them was a feed
wire<00:01:34.259> off<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.740> weathers<00:01:36.049> maybe<00:01:37.049> there's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
wire off it all weathers maybe there's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.690 
wire off it all weathers maybe there's
nothing<00:01:37.470> wrong<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.009> anyway<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.460> day's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
nothing wrong but anyway that day's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.310 
nothing wrong but anyway that day's
something<00:01:39.689> which<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> might<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> look

sticking<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.729> grab<00:01:57.000> hold<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.299> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
sticking out you just grab hold of that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.969 
sticking out you just grab hold of that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
just tucked up under there so although

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840 
just tucked up under there so although
that<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.710> missing<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.159> not<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> problem

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that is missing is not really a problem

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.660 
that is missing is not really a problem
as<00:02:03.210> such

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
as such

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
is broken on the bike it doesn't really

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.540 
is broken on the bike it doesn't really
seem<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> some<00:02:09.500> affect<00:02:09.800> anything<00:02:10.160> very<00:02:10.280> much

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
seem to some affect anything very much

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.040 
seem to some affect anything very much
but<00:02:11.150> if<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.330> wanted<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.660> get<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> knob<00:02:11.959> of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
but if you wanted to get a knob of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.390 
but if you wanted to get a knob of
bracket<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.560> there<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.860> would<00:02:12.920> sort<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.190> firm

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
bracket on there that would sort of firm

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.580 
bracket on there that would sort of firm
off<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.730> little<00:02:13.850> bit

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
off a little bit

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.510 
off a little bit
apart<00:02:15.590> from<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> rest<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.400> bike

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
apart from that the rest of the bike

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.309 
apart from that the rest of the bike
seems<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.150> be<00:02:17.240> as<00:02:17.360> far<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.720> can<00:02:17.780> tell<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.200> all

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
seems to be as far as I can tell so all

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.540 
seems to be as far as I can tell so all
working<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.890> doing<00:02:19.010> what<00:02:19.160> it's<00:02:19.250> supposed<00:02:19.280> to

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
working and doing what it's supposed to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.820 
working and doing what it's supposed to
do<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.569> exhaust<00:02:20.870> system<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> bike<00:02:21.620> has

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
do the exhaust system on the bike has

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.110 
do the exhaust system on the bike has
been<00:02:22.010> shortened<00:02:22.700> though<00:02:22.760> though<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.940> looks

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
been shortened though though it looks

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.730 
been shortened though though it looks
like<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.330> original<00:02:23.420> pipe<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.260> makes<00:02:24.500> quite<00:02:24.650> a

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
like the original pipe it makes quite a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.350 
like the original pipe it makes quite a
nice<00:02:24.890> tone<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.459> it's<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.610> little<00:02:25.850> bit<00:02:25.940> loud<00:02:26.120> and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
nice tone so it's a little bit loud and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.060 
nice tone so it's a little bit loud and
under<00:02:26.480> standard<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:27.470> gonna<00:02:27.740> be<00:02:28.040> a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
under standard but not gonna be a

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.449 
under standard but not gonna be a
problem<00:02:28.250> for<00:02:28.490> mo<00:02:28.730> T's<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:30.230> there<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:30.770> go<00:02:30.890> good

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
problem for mo T's so there we go good

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.090 
problem for mo T's so there we go good
luck<00:02:31.640> with<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.820> bidding
