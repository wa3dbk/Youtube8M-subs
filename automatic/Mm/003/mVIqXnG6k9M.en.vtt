the racing may be more entertaining
since<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.770> human<00:01:44.100> opponents<00:01:44.610> dealing

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
since you have human opponents dealing

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.490 
since you have human opponents dealing
with<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.150> same<00:01:45.360> crap<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:46.080> putting<00:01:46.380> up

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
with the same crap you're putting up

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000 
with the same crap you're putting up
with<00:01:46.680> still<00:01:47.520> good<00:01:48.060> luck<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.390> one<00:01:48.510> too

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
with still good luck with that one too

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.260 
with still good luck with that one too
who<00:01:50.010> knows<00:01:50.190> what<00:01:50.400> went<00:01:50.550> wrong<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.060> game

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
who knows what went wrong with this game

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
who knows what went wrong with this game
maybe<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.229> was<00:01:52.380> rushed

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
maybe it was rushed

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.650 
maybe it was rushed
perhaps<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> code<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:53.970> difficult<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> write

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
perhaps the code was difficult to write

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.890 
perhaps the code was difficult to write
but<00:01:55.229> regardless<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.010> issue<00:01:56.160> or<00:01:56.580> issues

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900
