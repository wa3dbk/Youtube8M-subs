00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.200 
second but I don't know why that's on my
desktop<00:00:42.000> still<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.260> are<00:00:44.030> if<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
desktop still but here we are if you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.310 
desktop still but here we are if you
don't<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> chamber<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
don't know what one in the chamber is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
don't know what one in the chamber is
it's<00:00:46.530> basically<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.430> start<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.120> one

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it's basically you start off with one

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
it's basically you start off with one
bullet<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> pistol<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> shoot

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
bullet in a pistol and you have to shoot

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.100 
bullet in a pistol and you have to shoot
the<00:00:50.820> other<00:00:51.000> person<00:00:51.390> basically<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the other person basically and if you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.340 
the other person basically and if you
miss<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.699> bullet<00:00:54.149> disappears<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
miss then your bullet disappears and you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
miss then your bullet disappears and you
after<00:00:55.649> only<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.340> only<00:00:56.520> knife<00:00:56.820> them<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
after only you can only knife them and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.729 
after only you can only knife them and
obviously<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.899> miss<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.289> well<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.620> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
obviously if they miss as well then it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.360 
obviously if they miss as well then it's
a<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.609> iphone<00:00:59.789> knife<00:01:00.270> situation<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
a it's an iphone knife situation really

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
a it's an iphone knife situation really
which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.760> fun<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.260> do

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
which is pretty fun but what you can do

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350 
which is pretty fun but what you can do
is<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> only<00:01:05.129> knife<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.760> save<00:01:06.180> up

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
is if you only knife you can save up

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
is if you only knife you can save up
bullet<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.930> every<00:01:07.110> time<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> kill<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
bullet so every time you get a kill you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.010 
bullet so every time you get a kill you
get<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> bullet<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.450> you've<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.600> three

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
get a bullet back so so you've got three

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
get a bullet back so so you've got three
knife<00:01:10.200> kills<00:01:10.500> you'd<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.830> three<00:01:11.400> bullets

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
knife kills you'd have three bullets

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
knife kills you'd have three bullets
saved<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.380> but<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.619> honest<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:13.950> really

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
saved up but to be honest I don't really

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
saved up but to be honest I don't really
play<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.119> instantly

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
