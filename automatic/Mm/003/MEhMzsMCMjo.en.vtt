00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello friends with you total and games want 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.389
 today to discuss with you one interesting 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.260
 the topic I noticed is that many of the players 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.740
 and mafia fans for some reason say that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.949
 Mafia 3 will be a failure that is to say 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 of course shows many factors 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.460
 which basically really well 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.910
 let's say give impressions are not the best 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.840
 games over here mafia 2 questions masterpiece 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.739
 and of course the mafia 3 is shown here 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.520
 a little on the other hand, why 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.219
 In general, the players say that the game will be 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.110
 dips so further firstly first 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.820
 the reason is what we play for 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.280
 black guy 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.000
 for some reason nobody liked it 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.219
 maybe all racists but I personally donâ€™t 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.719
 racist and me like that anyway 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.840
 the main thing that it was interesting not 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.290
 it is important for whom we play now even let 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.010
 for the girl play anyway you don't 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.790
 especially important also by itself here are the people 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.420
 write what's old there now yes we 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.159
 for him we will not hiccup but in fact 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 you need to understand this all because they 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.040
 fate and the developers did the same basis 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.030
 opportunities to play crammed then it would be 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 kinda kinda well 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.270
 monotonous gives let's say yes that is it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.180
 I will be bored too and should be given a chance 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.150
 another hero to other characters I'm so 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.990
 I think but there will still be wiggle 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.810
 let even the old is the most important thing 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.880
 because everything else is nonsense 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.740
 that is why even though we are 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.049
 we will not play for the see due to will 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.390
 the game and maybe it will just be 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.909
 masterpiece game 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.270
 as for joe, many u too resent 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.000
 because john isnt there all trouble game 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.190
 failure all jo no there game was played on 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.489
 in fact, joe will be me too 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.180
 discussed other videos will tell us 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.390
 fate but also people began to find fault 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.390
 and graphics and gameplay 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.760
 but if the graphics quibbles but let's say 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.500
 so seriously because she became a daughter 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.330
 the color is much better she became more beautiful 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.650
 here's a little bit even here people write that she 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.630
 similar to gta 5 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 Well, maybe even than I agree 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.450
 only it was possible to live even a little bit 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.060
 similar to the same gta 5 but not quite as well here 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.170
 but the most important thing is that people started 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:50.760
 just resent the gameplay 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.890
 which is in principle yes very very country 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.709
 understandably this is a very early build 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.230
 and finding fault with him does not make sense 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.070
 because the final version should all 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.980
 of the set although unlikely because 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.900
 if I go already showed such a little 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.810
 what will change the final version 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.880
 I give you my guarantee that's very well, 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.640
 The gameplay is basically pretty 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.030
 expect and of course I expected much 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.250
 I expected more more realistic 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.590
 physics of the behavior of machines is in the first 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.220
 queue because what we were shown 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.160
 absolutely not what we expected to see 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.160
 machines behave very arcade somehow 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.350
 painfully toy that is when we 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.860
 crashing into another car they explode 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.780
 why why car explodes here I 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.560
 crashed into a video car now she doesn't 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.870
 exploded 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.320
 about the mafia, are you showing the cats? 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.040
 crashing into the car and it all explodes 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.870
 it is very strange then what else wanted 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.520
 say about the movement of the main character 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:01.940
 movement in principle is very similar 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.340
 physics of movement of the thrust Perevi 2 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.950
 Well, that is, even they took the idea with this 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.630
 games are basically okay but 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.670
 the most interesting thing is that even the main one 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.300
 the hero very sharply somehow moves to 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.459
 to the enemy 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.010
 that is, it turns out u is worth a guy yes we 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.860
 approach to him and already one at a distance 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.230
 two meters we press attack and he abruptly 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.070
 to him flies up and kill it very 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.940
 strange too 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.370
 well and of course shooting in principle but 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.090
 shooting is essentially the same as mafia 2 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.190
 nothing special there's no well 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.470
 of course upset you can wear 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.470
 these weapons have no health regeneration 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.810
 there we will look closer to the exit of the game 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.919
 because so far 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.660
 dissatisfied with the presentation of the game, unfortunately 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.060
 therefore, in principle, they can be understood 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.470
 because they did not wait very long and 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.430
 they really showed us a little bit 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.800
 different from what we expected 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.830
 see but nevertheless the most important thing 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.870
 that mothers have already announced what is known 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.780
 already at least some details showed 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.800
 gameplay is the most important thing but the fact that the game 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.130
 there will be failures or not this of course 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:27.630
 let's really say big statements towards 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.280
 games, I basically hope it is in 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.669
 anyway be good because 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.130
 this mafia she can not be bad here 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.840
 well and of course i will take the game what love 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.630
 whatever it is I will still not 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.150
 respect because I myself are fans of the series 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.610
 and I was looking forward to the third part I 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.000
 just not sure conscience will not allow 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.690
 just say that the game is a failure 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.590
 what is she nyasha come on for this in 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.860
 principle, in principle, see friends but 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.590
 so far the players are unhappy for some reason 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.360
 maybe they have reasons but 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.890
 let's see of course friends on this all 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.890
 thanks for watching everyone bye
