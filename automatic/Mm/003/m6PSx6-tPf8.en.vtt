back to their to see now the whole top
the<00:02:20.310> whole<00:02:20.489> seat<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:22.349> see<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.400> piece<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the whole seat and see this piece is the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.300 
the whole seat and see this piece is the
branch<00:02:25.110> XE<00:02:25.860> dad<00:02:26.069> both<00:02:26.569> both<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.840> those<00:02:28.099> one<00:02:29.099> on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
branch XE dad both both of those one on

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.699 
branch XE dad both both of those one on
each<00:02:29.489> side<00:02:30.980> which<00:02:31.980> go<00:02:32.250> underneath<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.920> seat

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
each side which go underneath the seat

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.910 
each side which go underneath the seat
now<00:02:37.709> here's<00:02:38.010> another<00:02:38.310> one<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.920> set

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
now here's another one we just just set

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.979 
now here's another one we just just set
on<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> branches<00:02:42.269> when<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.480> cut<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
on to the branches when I cut the

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.860 
on to the branches when I cut the
branches<00:02:43.440> off<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:44.660> because<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.810> were

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
branches off here because they were

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.500 
branches off here because they were
really<00:02:46.500> draping<00:02:47.099> down<00:02:47.580> they<00:02:48.300> aren't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
really draping down they aren't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.660 
really draping down they aren't
completely<00:02:48.660> blocking<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.010> thin<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.580> you

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
completely blocking the thin so you

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.960 
completely blocking the thin so you
couldn't<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.269> outside<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:53.280> when<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.459> cut<00:02:53.790> them

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
couldn't see outside so when I cut them

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.770 
couldn't see outside so when I cut them
off<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.390> always<00:02:54.690> leave<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.370> pc<00:02:56.599> continue<00:02:57.599> to

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
off I always leave a pc continue to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.770 
off I always leave a pc continue to
climb<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.319> tree<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:59.819> I<00:02:59.879> think<00:02:59.970> trees<00:03:00.510> should

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
climb the tree so I think trees should

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.119 
climb the tree so I think trees should
be<00:03:00.930> climbed<00:03:01.319> forever<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.099> ever<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.550> ever<00:03:07.129> so

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
be climbed forever and ever and ever so

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.030 
be climbed forever and ever and ever so
if<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.430> want<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.760> make<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.209> seat<00:03:10.080> up<00:03:10.349> in<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.680> tree

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
if you want to make a seat up in a tree

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.330 
if you want to make a seat up in a tree
that<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:14.040> pretty<00:03:14.310> stable<00:03:14.760> way<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.569> I

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
that is a pretty stable way to do it I

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
that is a pretty stable way to do it I
did<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.550> with<00:03:17.670> Abraham<00:03:18.239> he<00:03:18.420> must<00:03:18.629> have<00:03:18.780> been

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
did that with Abraham he must have been

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:30.110 
did that with Abraham he must have been
about<00:03:19.019> four<00:03:19.620> or<00:03:20.360> five<00:03:28.310> okay<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.970> do<00:03:30.090> that

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
about four or five okay you can do that

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.200 
about four or five okay you can do that
at<00:03:30.450> home<00:03:30.480> bye
