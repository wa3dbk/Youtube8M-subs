00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
after that amazing speech that I just

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.840 
after that amazing speech that I just
gave<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.799> 10<00:01:20.009> words<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.610> anyway

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
gave all like 10 words of it but anyway

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
gave all like 10 words of it but anyway
that<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.060> actually<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.900> cool<00:01:22.020> touch

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that is actually a really cool touch

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
that is actually a really cool touch
that<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:23.970> added<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> game

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that I think that they added to the game

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.969 
that I think that they added to the game
those<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.200> things<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.650> myplayer

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
those little things that your myplayer

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.039 
those little things that your myplayer
says<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> fact<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.900> they

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
says I really like the fact that they

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.340 
says I really like the fact that they
added<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.280> thing<00:01:30.350> about

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
added that and I think one thing about

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
added that and I think one thing about
good<00:01:31.770> sports<00:01:32.100> games<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
good sports games is that they have a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
good sports games is that they have a
lot<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:34.049> things<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.650> them<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> they

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
lot of little things in them and they

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.210 
lot of little things in them and they
add<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> same<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
add up so it was the same way with a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.730 
add up so it was the same way with a
game<00:01:38.430> called<00:01:38.460> NFL<00:01:39.000> 2k5<00:01:39.390> from<00:01:39.990> back<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> day

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
game called NFL 2k5 from back in the day

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.760 
game called NFL 2k5 from back in the day
with<00:01:40.950> football<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:42.030> think<00:01:42.420> NBA<00:01:42.869> 2k13<00:01:43.259> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
with football and I think NBA 2k13 is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.319 
with football and I think NBA 2k13 is
honestly<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> best<00:01:44.369> basketball<00:01:44.670> game<00:01:45.149> I've

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
honestly the best basketball game I've

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.410 
honestly the best basketball game I've
ever<00:01:45.360> played<00:01:46.220> even<00:01:47.220> better<00:01:47.520> than<00:01:47.700> 2k<00:01:48.000> 11<00:01:48.030> which

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
ever played even better than 2k 11 which

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.179 
ever played even better than 2k 11 which
is<00:01:48.450> surprising<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.590> Jeremy<00:01:49.979> wind

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
