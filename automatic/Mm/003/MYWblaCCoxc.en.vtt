00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.949 
going on and I believe that a lot of
that<00:02:17.850> stuff<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:18.420> toned<00:02:18.720> down

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
that stuff is going to get toned down

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.140 
that stuff is going to get toned down
it's<00:02:19.200> completely<00:02:19.680> taken<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.130> or<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.970> will

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
it's completely taken out or it will

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.290 
it's completely taken out or it will
probably<00:02:21.450> be<00:02:21.800> implied<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:23.190> what<00:02:23.790> happens<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
probably be implied of what happens to

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.180 
probably be implied of what happens to
certain<00:02:24.600> characters<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.230> if<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.470> have<00:02:25.890> read
