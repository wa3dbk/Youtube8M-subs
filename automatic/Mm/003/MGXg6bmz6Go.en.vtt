00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
is actually going to go for I'd say

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.680 
is actually going to go for I'd say
about<00:04:10.130> probably<00:04:11.130> at<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.310> most<00:04:11.459> 25k<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.420> I

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
about probably at the most 25k and I

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.800 
about probably at the most 25k and I
picked<00:04:12.900> him<00:04:13.019> off<00:04:13.079> a<00:04:13.280> 13,250<00:04:14.280> Quinn<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:14.910> you

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
picked him off a 13,250 Quinn so you

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.060 
picked him off a 13,250 Quinn so you
know<00:04:15.930> as<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.229> see<00:04:16.470> here<00:04:16.650> he's<00:04:16.739> actually<00:04:16.859> been

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
know as I see here he's actually been

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.069 
know as I see here he's actually been
price<00:04:17.370> fixed<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:17.970> could<00:04:18.419> actually<00:04:18.570> sell<00:04:18.930> him

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
price fixed so I could actually sell him

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.159 
price fixed so I could actually sell him
now<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:20.459> think<00:04:21.030> that'd<00:04:21.209> be<00:04:21.329> quite<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.630> nice<00:04:21.810> idea

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
now I think that'd be quite a nice idea

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.900 
now I think that'd be quite a nice idea
but<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.979> know<00:04:23.099> as<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.250> see<00:04:23.520> there's<00:04:23.700> still<00:04:23.880> a

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
but you know as you see there's still a

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.480 
but you know as you see there's still a
few<00:04:24.210> on<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> market<00:04:24.750> which<00:04:25.099> still<00:04:26.099> are<00:04:26.220> about

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
few on the market which still are about

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.000

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
21

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.860 
21
thousand<00:04:27.280> five<00:04:27.400> hundred<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.120> probably<00:04:28.630> wait

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
thousand five hundred so I probably wait

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.390 
thousand five hundred so I probably wait
a<00:04:28.900> couple<00:04:29.140> more<00:04:29.350> days<00:04:29.530> until<00:04:29.920> there's

a couple more days until there's

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.890 
a couple more days until there's
probably<00:04:30.610> about<00:04:30.700> three<00:04:31.090> or<00:04:31.120> four<00:04:31.240> pages<00:04:31.660> of

probably about three or four pages of

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.510 
probably about three or four pages of
him<00:04:32.080> because<00:04:32.680> that's<00:04:32.800> when<00:04:33.010> you<00:04:33.100> can<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.400> know
