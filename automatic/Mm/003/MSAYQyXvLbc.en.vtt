00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.750
 perhaps 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
 Paris 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:14.499
 me 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.939
 we will now make a terrine of foie gras and apples 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.259
 land or more exactly potatoes and foie gras 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.259
 to do this we need a foie gras of 400 to 500 grams 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.259
 of extra category at the first choice and obviously in order to follow for 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.539
 this recipe we need potatoes but a daf liver thing 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.670
 fat of pepper of salt of guerande and duck fat 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.510
 so we now have to start preparing 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.150
 so of course I had seen the potatoes peeled 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.060
 cut into thin strips 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.250
 and now we are going to prepare the foie gras 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.300
 that we are going to start cutting into thin slices of 4 millimeters 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.010
 thick 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.530
 we will wait times told we will start to climb the terrine 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.770
 to do this we will take the slices of potatoes 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.270
 That we have 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.220
 season with a little salt 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.810
 Mecachrome 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 put three layers of sliced ​​potato film 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.680
 a layer of slices foie gras 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.950
 we season a little bit of pepper on foie gras we put two steps three 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.250
 layers of potatoes 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.410
 leads her foie gras 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.110
 two to three strokes of potatoes and we renew the operation during 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.190
 these layers and then on the top we spend a little bit terrine 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.690
 and for has 50 grams 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.540
 duck fat 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.730
 to redo the parchment paper on top the first is the second they 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.340
 face slightly 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.580
 so then we will accept the crisis obama paid 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.480
 some water 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.870
 at about halfway up the terrine 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.270
 and we will have it on the sheet of 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.950
 rafa does not make progress in order to face the challenges it is to create a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 little bit of provence to sion so now we are going to see put 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.260
 in the oven 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.160
 at temperatures of 140 degrees and cooking 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.189
 will last roughly 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.189
 one hour thirty to one forty-five 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.179
 this is our territory 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.979
 of foie gras and potatoes 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.959
 it's always nice to go and rest for two to three days in the fridge 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:29.949
 also 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.569
 in the same way as the traditional foie gras terrine we do not see this 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.789
 because it's a little under warm water so that the slingshot greece to be able 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.209
 unmould experts our perimeter more easily 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.829
 our foie gras terry the fatteners the plate we spent our 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.449
 plate for 2 to 3 minutes in a 160-degree oven to serve the 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.879
 terrible just heaven 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.400
 our plate so heat how two minutes thirty is a little bit 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.749
 perfect hot 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.349
 saffron slightly 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.409
 I'll put 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.409
 a little bit of salt flower of guerande 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.169
 a small round of pepper mill 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.479
 we will serve a little bored 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.219
 it's really the thing would not be very good appetite because it's very 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.219
 very good 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.149
