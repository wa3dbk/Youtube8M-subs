please sir ps2 and 60fps cat base so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
please sir ps2 and 60fps cat base so
basically<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.510> moment<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.380> doing

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
basically for the moment I'm not doing

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
basically for the moment I'm not doing
videos<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.340> 60fps<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.510> only<00:01:12.630> reason<00:01:12.720> for

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
videos and 60fps and the only reason for

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.499 
videos and 60fps and the only reason for
that<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.799> file<00:01:14.100> size<00:01:14.390> kind<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that is because the file size kind of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.109 
that is because the file size kind of
doubles<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.860> me<00:01:16.979> uploading<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.610> video<00:01:17.790> can

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
doubles and for me uploading a video can

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.719 
doubles and for me uploading a video can
take<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> four<00:01:19.680> hours<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.549> when

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
take up to four hours and that's when

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
take up to four hours and that's when
I've<00:01:20.850> compressed<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.750> lot<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.799> always

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I've compressed it a lot and I always

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.420 
I've compressed it a lot and I always
compress<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> 30<00:01:23.850> FPS<00:01:24.409> but<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.770> should<00:01:26.250> be

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
compress the 30 FPS but I should be

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.660 
compress the 30 FPS but I should be
moving<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> next<00:01:27.240> month<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.170> very

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
moving in the next month or so and very

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.010 
moving in the next month or so and very
hopefully<00:01:29.670> I'll<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.939> guessing<00:01:30.150> fiber-optic

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
hopefully I'll be guessing fiber-optic

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
hopefully I'll be guessing fiber-optic
broadband<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.280> basically<00:01:32.640> we'll<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.909> no

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
broadband so basically we'll have no

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
broadband so basically we'll have no
restrictions<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.990> quality<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.950> able

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
restrictions on quality or just be able

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
restrictions on quality or just be able
to<00:01:35.189> upload<00:01:35.280> whatever<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:36.049> illumine<00:01:37.049> I've

to upload whatever I want illumine I've

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.260 
to upload whatever I want illumine I've
got<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> 1<00:01:37.500> 1<00:01:37.890> megabit<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.490> two<00:01:38.759> megabit<00:01:39.090> line

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
got a 1 1 megabit of two megabit line

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.490 
got a 1 1 megabit of two megabit line
somewhere<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.020> might<00:01:40.140> even<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.320> one

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
somewhere but it might even be one

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.280 
somewhere but it might even be one
megabit<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.920> half<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.960> uploading<00:01:42.960> things<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.259> a

know<00:03:39.769> what<00:03:39.950> like<00:03:40.160> chat<00:03:40.459> board<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:40.940> was<00:03:41.060> awesome

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
know what like chat board it was awesome

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.420 
know what like chat board it was awesome
it<00:03:41.660> was<00:03:41.750> just<00:03:41.870> probably<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.799> first<00:03:43.040> chat

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
it was just probably the first chat

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.530 
it was just probably the first chat
board<00:03:43.640> I've<00:03:43.760> ever<00:03:43.880> been<00:03:44.060> on<00:03:44.120> when<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.330> was<00:03:44.480> about

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
board I've ever been on when I was about

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.039 
board I've ever been on when I was about
13<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:46.489> guess<00:03:47.209> I<00:03:47.239> just<00:03:47.330> went<00:03:47.600> with<00:03:47.720> toast

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
13 and I guess I just went with toast

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.620 
13 and I guess I just went with toast
faces<00:03:48.470> King<00:03:48.709> I'm<00:03:49.100> not<00:03:49.220> sure<00:03:49.280> why<00:03:49.610> it's<00:03:50.269> just<00:03:50.480> I

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
faces King I'm not sure why it's just I

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.720 
faces King I'm not sure why it's just I
think<00:03:50.690> as<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> toast<00:03:51.230> face<00:03:51.470> icon<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.489> chat

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
think as a toast face icon in the chat

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.300 
think as a toast face icon in the chat
port<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.450> when<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.930> went<00:03:54.200> from<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.950> chat<00:03:55.130> board

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
port so when I went from the chat board

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.039 
port so when I went from the chat board
into<00:03:55.640> youtube<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.060> was<00:03:56.150> like<00:03:56.269> hmm<00:03:56.450> toast<00:03:56.870> face

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
into youtube I was like hmm toast face

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.259 
into youtube I was like hmm toast face
is<00:03:57.320> king<00:03:57.560> that's<00:03:58.310> pretty<00:03:58.519> cool<00:03:58.670> it's<00:03:58.910> my<00:03:59.000> first

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
is king that's pretty cool it's my first

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.690 
is king that's pretty cool it's my first
icon<00:03:59.750> but<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.680> would<00:04:00.799> have<00:04:00.920> been<00:04:01.040> my<00:04:01.130> first<00:04:01.280> icon

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
icon but I would have been my first icon

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.800 
icon but I would have been my first icon
maybe<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.940> was<00:04:02.060> older<00:04:02.269> than<00:04:02.360> that<00:04:02.420> i'm<00:04:02.660> not<00:04:02.690> sure

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
maybe I was older than that i'm not sure

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.690 
maybe I was older than that i'm not sure
but<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.260> was<00:04:03.380> in<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.620> chat<00:04:03.920> board<00:04:04.220> never<00:04:04.430> really

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
but it was in a chat board never really

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.039 
but it was in a chat board never really
used<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.030> before<00:04:05.090> we're<00:04:05.540> just<00:04:05.630> loads<00:04:05.900> of

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
used it before we're just loads of

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.520 
used it before we're just loads of
remnant

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
remnant

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.200 
remnant
and<00:04:08.530> then<00:04:08.650> T<00:04:08.830> faces<00:04:09.250> Ming<00:04:09.430> is<00:04:09.670> just<00:04:09.940> basically

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
and then T faces Ming is just basically

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.540 
and then T faces Ming is just basically
toast<00:04:10.540> faces<00:04:10.930> King<00:04:11.170> instead<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.620> tokyo<00:04:12.280> tea

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
toast faces King instead of tokyo tea

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.940 
toast faces King instead of tokyo tea
and<00:04:12.850> instead<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.630> king<00:04:13.810> it's<00:04:14.170> like<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
and instead of a king it's like the

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.380 
and instead of a king it's like the
Chinese<00:04:15.190> Ming<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.959> those<00:04:17.230> were<00:04:17.470> two<00:04:17.620> names<00:04:17.860> I

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
Chinese Ming so those were two names I

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.790 
Chinese Ming so those were two names I
kind<00:04:19.390> of<00:04:19.510> wish<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.930> my<00:04:20.110> channel<00:04:20.590> wasn't

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
kind of wish that my channel wasn't

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.340 
kind of wish that my channel wasn't
known<00:04:20.920> named<00:04:21.400> toast<00:04:21.850> faces<00:04:22.240> king<00:04:22.450> but<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.080> set

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
known named toast faces king but I set

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.230 
known named toast faces king but I set
it<00:04:23.500> probably<00:04:23.800> like<00:04:23.890> a<00:04:24.010> hero<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.550> again<00:04:24.820> and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
it probably like a hero so again and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.610 
it probably like a hero so again and
apparently<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.720> can't<00:04:25.960> change<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.320> now<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.560> I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
apparently you can't change it now so I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.380 
apparently you can't change it now so I
can't<00:04:26.800> change<00:04:26.980> it<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.220> dracaena<00:04:27.550> anyway

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
can't change it to dracaena anyway

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.910 
can't change it to dracaena anyway
there's<00:04:28.570> another<00:04:28.750> Joshi<00:04:29.140> know<00:04:29.320> with<00:04:29.560> no

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
there's another Joshi know with no

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
there's another Joshi know with no
videos<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:30.700> i<00:04:32.340> kinda<00:04:33.340> wish<00:04:33.400> i<00:04:33.520> could<00:04:33.670> take<00:04:33.790> his

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
videos so i kinda wish i could take his

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.110 
videos so i kinda wish i could take his
channel<00:04:34.380> samuel<00:04:35.380> elkin<00:04:35.920> says<00:04:36.190> hey<00:04:36.550> joshy<00:04:36.970> no

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
channel samuel elkin says hey joshy no

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.880 
channel samuel elkin says hey joshy no
it<00:04:37.300> appears<00:04:37.480> your<00:04:37.870> observer<00:04:38.200> cam<00:04:38.440> movements

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
it appears your observer cam movements

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.040 
it appears your observer cam movements
are<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.070> bit<00:04:39.370> choppy<00:04:39.670> do<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.660> have<00:04:40.780> your<00:04:40.870> mouse

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
are a bit choppy do you have your mouse

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.140 
are a bit choppy do you have your mouse
on<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.260> low<00:04:41.500> sensitivity<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.400> think<00:04:42.940> if<00:04:43.060> you

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
on a low sensitivity I think if you

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.120 
on a low sensitivity I think if you
increase<00:04:43.480> to<00:04:43.630> set<00:04:43.810> your<00:04:43.930> sensitivity<00:04:44.680> you'll

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
increase to set your sensitivity you'll

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.110 
increase to set your sensitivity you'll
be<00:04:45.220> able<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.430> pan<00:04:45.640> around<00:04:45.670> a<00:04:45.970> lot<00:04:46.090> more

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
be able to pan around a lot more

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.110 
be able to pan around a lot more
smoothly<00:04:46.890> thanks<00:04:47.890> for<00:04:47.980> your<00:04:48.100> video<00:04:48.400> oh<00:04:48.640> thank

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
smoothly thanks for your video oh thank

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.280 
smoothly thanks for your video oh thank
you<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:50.620> yeah<00:04:51.220> with<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.880> smoothness<00:04:52.540> in<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
you but yeah with the smoothness in the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.840 
you but yeah with the smoothness in the
sort<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.710> balance<00:04:54.010> between<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.340> tea<00:04:54.580> because

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
sort of balance between the tea because

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.760 
sort of balance between the tea because
if<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.330> put<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.720> too<00:04:55.960> high<00:04:56.170> you<00:04:56.230> sort<00:04:56.680> of

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
if you put it too high you sort of

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.400 
if you put it too high you sort of
chocolate<00:04:57.610> not<00:04:57.910> chocolate<00:04:57.940> but<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.900> soon

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
chocolate not chocolate but you soon

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.960 
chocolate not chocolate but you soon
from<00:04:59.650> one<00:04:59.860> shot<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.250> another<00:05:00.520> it's<00:05:00.760> really

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
from one shot to another it's really

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.970 
from one shot to another it's really
hard<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.210> control<00:05:01.470> but<00:05:02.470> with<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> low

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
hard to control but with a low

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.260 
hard to control but with a low
sensitivity<00:05:03.370> sometimes<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:04.030> miss<00:05:04.120> the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
sensitivity sometimes you miss the

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.370 
sensitivity sometimes you miss the
action<00:05:04.390> because<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:04.870> trying<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.140> move<00:05:05.260> your

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
action because you trying to move your

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.260 
action because you trying to move your
mouse<00:05:05.560> across<00:05:05.860> so<00:05:06.220> maybe<00:05:06.790> I<00:05:06.910> haven't<00:05:07.180> got

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
mouse across so maybe I haven't got

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.320 
mouse across so maybe I haven't got
completely<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.110> balance<00:05:08.920> yet<00:05:09.130> maybe<00:05:10.120> should

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
completely the balance yet maybe should

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.170 
completely the balance yet maybe should
slightly<00:05:11.020> up<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.830> sensitivity<00:05:12.490> because<00:05:12.940> why

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
slightly up the sensitivity because why

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.150 
slightly up the sensitivity because why
is<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.420> I<00:05:13.480> completely<00:05:13.990> lowered<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.470> thinking<00:05:15.010> I

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
is it I completely lowered it thinking I

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.790 
is it I completely lowered it thinking I
could<00:05:15.220> get<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.700> smooth<00:05:16.330> camera<00:05:16.960> but<00:05:17.380> obviously

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
could get a smooth camera but obviously

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
bit of PAL stone getting really into it

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
4 but at the same time it's very similar

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.640 
4 but at the same time it's very similar
to<00:05:54.040> planetside<00:05:54.460> 2<00:05:54.670> and<00:05:54.940> 0<00:05:55.420> as<00:05:56.200> long<00:05:56.380> as<00:05:56.530> it's

to planetside 2 and 0 as long as it's
good<00:05:56.800> fights<00:05:57.040> on<00:05:57.250> I'd<00:05:57.370> rather<00:05:57.550> play

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
good fights on I'd rather play

good fights on I'd rather play
planetside<00:05:58.030> 2<00:05:58.420> at<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:58.690> moment<00:05:59.080> although

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
planetside 2 at the moment although

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.890 
planetside 2 at the moment although
black<00:06:00.310> platter<00:06:00.580> before<00:06:00.910> is<00:06:01.060> very<00:06:01.300> visually

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
black platter before is very visually

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.690 
black platter before is very visually
compelling<00:06:02.260> and<00:06:02.530> its<00:06:02.650> environments<00:06:03.460> are<00:06:03.520> very

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
compelling and its environments are very

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.940 
compelling and its environments are very
nice<00:06:03.850> it's<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:04.660> do<00:06:04.810> feel<00:06:04.990> it's<00:06:05.200> very<00:06:05.380> empty<00:06:05.740> at

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
nice it's you do feel it's very empty at

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.800 
nice it's you do feel it's very empty at
times<00:06:06.160> because<00:06:06.520> of<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.790> 64<00:06:07.240> people<00:06:07.420> rather

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
times because of the 64 people rather

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.530 
times because of the 64 people rather
than<00:06:07.960> having<00:06:08.740> a<00:06:08.890> full<00:06:09.100> well<00:06:09.940> how<00:06:10.150> many<00:06:10.360> ever

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
than having a full well how many ever

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.530 
than having a full well how many ever
would<00:06:10.960> be<00:06:10.990> on<00:06:11.170> a<00:06:11.200> little<00:06:11.680> hex<00:06:12.300> anywhere<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.390> was

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
would be on a little hex anywhere it was

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.990 
would be on a little hex anywhere it was
from<00:06:13.720> 100<00:06:14.200> it<00:06:14.650> could<00:06:14.830> be<00:06:14.950> there<00:06:15.130> yeah<00:06:15.520> as<00:06:15.880> you

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
from 100 it could be there yeah as you

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000 
from 100 it could be there yeah as you
put<00:06:16.180> csgo<00:06:16.660> videos<00:06:16.930> out<00:06:17.080> there<00:06:17.110> good<00:06:17.530> but<00:06:17.830> it's

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
put csgo videos out there good but it's

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.740 
put csgo videos out there good but it's
harder<00:06:18.340> for<00:06:18.370> me<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.610> know<00:06:18.880> what<00:06:19.150> people<00:06:19.690> would

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
harder for me to know what people would

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.780 
harder for me to know what people would
want<00:06:19.960> to<00:06:20.020> see<00:06:20.290> over<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:20.890> games<00:06:21.100> more<00:06:21.760> than

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
playing evolve I'm gonna give that to go

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.140 
playing evolve I'm gonna give that to go
maybe<00:06:32.050> put<00:06:32.260> a<00:06:32.290> video<00:06:32.500> up<00:06:32.620> but<00:06:33.580> actually<00:06:34.090> the

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
maybe put a video up but actually the

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.460 
maybe put a video up but actually the
something<00:06:34.480> to<00:06:34.570> mention<00:06:34.870> this<00:06:34.960> when<00:06:35.110> I<00:06:35.170> start

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
something to mention this when I start

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.230 
something to mention this when I start
twitching<00:06:35.710> which<00:06:36.280> will<00:06:36.460> be<00:06:36.580> when<00:06:36.850> I<00:06:36.910> get<00:06:37.090> the

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
twitching which will be when I get the

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.780 
twitching which will be when I get the
better<00:06:37.360> internet<00:06:37.810> i'll<00:06:38.710> also<00:06:39.070> be<00:06:39.370> playing<00:06:39.610> at

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
better internet i'll also be playing at

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.400 
better internet i'll also be playing at
random<00:06:40.240> games<00:06:40.450> and<00:06:40.600> that<00:06:40.690> maybe<00:06:40.990> it'll<00:06:41.230> have

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
random games and that maybe it'll have

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.500 
random games and that maybe it'll have
highlight<00:06:41.830> highlights<00:06:42.520> from<00:06:42.670> it<00:06:42.820> so<00:06:43.330> then<00:06:43.480> I

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
highlight highlights from it so then I

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.420 
highlight highlights from it so then I
can<00:06:43.900> have<00:06:44.430> stuff<00:06:45.430> that<00:06:45.460> I<00:06:45.640> think<00:06:45.970> is<00:06:46.150> good<00:06:46.780> and

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
can have stuff that I think is good and

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.850 
can have stuff that I think is good and
of<00:06:48.430> high<00:06:49.030> quality<00:06:49.060> and<00:06:49.720> that<00:06:50.440> take<00:06:50.650> a<00:06:50.680> bit<00:06:50.830> of

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
of high quality and that take a bit of

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.380 
of high quality and that take a bit of
editing<00:06:50.980> I<00:06:51.520> can<00:06:51.670> do<00:06:51.820> those<00:06:51.970> as<00:06:52.240> in<00:06:52.720> there

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
editing I can do those as in there
