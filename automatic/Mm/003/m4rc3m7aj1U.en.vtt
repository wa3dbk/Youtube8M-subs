r rating to make it more lifelike now I

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.220 
r rating to make it more lifelike now I
gotta<00:00:20.939> say<00:00:21.060> I've<00:00:21.180> tried<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.660> I've<00:00:21.960> never

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
gotta say I've tried it I've never

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.720 
gotta say I've tried it I've never
driven<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.650> real<00:00:22.800> one<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> same<00:00:23.460> very

driven the real one for the same very
lifelike<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.419> me<00:00:24.599> so<00:00:25.349> if<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.529> tell<00:00:25.829> me<00:00:25.860> I've

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
lifelike to me so if you tell me I've

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.609 
lifelike to me so if you tell me I've
considered<00:00:26.820> added<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.869> final<00:00:28.259> shakedown

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
considered added the the final shakedown

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.010 
considered added the the final shakedown
and<00:00:29.160> ticked<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.239> set<00:00:30.509> ups<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.869> things

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
and ticked it off and set ups and things

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.869 
and ticked it off and set ups and things
on<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> i<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.650> absolutely<00:00:32.070> nothing<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
on it i would see absolutely nothing the

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.110 
on it i would see absolutely nothing the
r18<00:00:36.769> from<00:00:37.769> the<00:00:37.980> visual<00:00:38.370> point<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> view<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.940> was

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
r18 from the visual point of view I was

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.850 
r18 from the visual point of view I was
absolutely<00:00:39.360> amazed<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> guys<00:00:40.589> about

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
absolutely amazed that the guys about

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.750 
absolutely amazed that the guys about
the<00:00:40.980> detail<00:00:41.280> order<00:00:41.519> of<00:00:42.330> course<00:00:42.620> they're

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
the detail order of course they're

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.640 
the detail order of course they're
absolutely<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.320> then<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.650> I<00:00:46.890> got<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.699> the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
absolutely and then when I got into the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.979 
absolutely and then when I got into the
base<00:00:49.650> setter<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.790> was<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.720> bit<00:00:51.900> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
base setter it was just really a bit of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.660 
base setter it was just really a bit of
fine-tuning<00:00:52.199> their<00:00:52.650> I've<00:00:52.799> got<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> dynamics

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
fine-tuning their I've got the dynamics

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.420 
fine-tuning their I've got the dynamics
working<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.210> very<00:00:54.330> well<00:00:54.659> but<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.799> was<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.159> case

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
working very very well but it was a case

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.850 
working very very well but it was a case
of<00:00:56.460> fine-tuning<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.269> then<00:00:57.780> walking<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
of fine-tuning and then walking in to

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.160 
of fine-tuning and then walking in to
where<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.369> today<00:00:59.430> with<00:01:00.119> the<00:01:00.239> car<00:01:00.449> because

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
where we are today with the car because

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
where we are today with the car because
here<00:01:01.439> is<00:01:01.650> basically<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.820> last<00:01:03.000> race<00:01:03.269> this<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
here is basically the last race this is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.770 
here is basically the last race this is
where<00:01:03.720> my<00:01:03.869> memory<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> r18<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.630> was

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
where my memory of the r18 is and it was

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.140 
where my memory of the r18 is and it was
transporting<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.920> information<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.909> bring

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
transporting that information to bring

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.620 
transporting that information to bring
it<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.140> date<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.700> ultimately

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it right up to date you know ultimately

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.510 
it right up to date you know ultimately
a<00:01:13.020> car<00:01:13.770> development<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.920> sim

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
a car development and and the sim

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.660 
a car development and and the sim
development<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.500> similar<00:01:19.890> way<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.550> know

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
development is in a similar way you know

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
development is in a similar way you know
your<00:01:20.850> walk<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:21.390> tweak<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.870> develop

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
your walk on it you tweak it you develop

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.470 
your walk on it you tweak it you develop
it<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.770> always<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.160> that<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.550> it's<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.910> the

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
it you always do that and it's on the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.930 
it you always do that and it's on the
circuit<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.200> always<00:01:25.350> working<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
circuit we are always working with the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.360 
circuit we are always working with the
tires<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.290> very<00:01:28.530> big<00:01:28.710> key<00:01:28.980> in<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.280> us

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
tires that's a very big key in for us

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.520 
tires that's a very big key in for us
with<00:01:29.550> Michelin<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> partner<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.440> i

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
with Michelin a partner but then if i

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
with Michelin a partner but then if i
transport<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> cloth<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.940> know<00:01:33.030> you've

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
transport that a cloth you know you've

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.399 
transport that a cloth you know you've
got<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.450> lead<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> tire<00:01:33.900> pressures<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
got to lead to the tire pressures and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.750 
got to lead to the tire pressures and
temperatures<00:01:34.680> come<00:01:35.010> up<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> Sun<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
temperatures come up on the Sun and the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.280 
temperatures come up on the Sun and the
reactions<00:01:36.450> are<00:01:36.570> different<00:01:36.840> between<00:01:36.900> going

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
reactions are different between going

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.200 
reactions are different between going
out<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.650> pits<00:01:37.890> lat<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.400> lap<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> like

out to the pits lat one lap to like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
out to the pits lat one lap to like
three<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.690> then<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> feeling<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
three and then you get the feeling it is

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.800 
three and then you get the feeling it is
trying<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:41.880> transport<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.480> of<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
trying to transport all of that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.380 
trying to transport all of that
information<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.120> say<00:01:45.150> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
information to and I have to say the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
information to and I have to say the
last<00:01:45.659> run<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.350> had<00:01:46.650> just<00:01:47.400> over<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.700> week<00:01:47.880> ago<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
last run I had just over a week ago and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.620 
last run I had just over a week ago and
i<00:01:49.260> was<00:01:49.650> thinking<00:01:50.430> price<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.570> like

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
i was thinking price this is just like

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.090 
i was thinking price this is just like
me<00:01:51.930> although<00:01:52.140> i've<00:01:52.350> got<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> supplemental

that's one of the big discussion points

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.650 
that's one of the big discussion points
and<00:02:47.400> always<00:02:47.670> has<00:02:47.820> been<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.180> always<00:02:48.270> will<00:02:48.480> be

nice you know 30 years ago the more they

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.070 
nice you know 30 years ago the more they
were<00:02:50.790> still<00:02:51.000> discussing<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.570> 30<00:02:51.900> years
