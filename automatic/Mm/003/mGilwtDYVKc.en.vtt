00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
makes it more whitish as opposed to

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.679 
makes it more whitish as opposed to
brassy<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:04.339> far<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.429> your<00:01:05.579> blonde<00:01:05.819> goes<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
brassy as far as your blonde goes so I

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.469 
brassy as far as your blonde goes so I
thought<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.929> was<00:01:07.259> a<00:01:07.319> really<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:08.450> shampoo<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
thought that was a really good shampoo I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
thought that was a really good shampoo I
didn't<00:01:09.840> use<00:01:09.929> it<00:01:09.959> every<00:01:10.319> single<00:01:10.499> time<00:01:10.679> i

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
didn't use it every single time i

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
didn't use it every single time i
shampooed<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:11.999> like<00:01:12.270> maybe<00:01:12.509> every<00:01:12.959> other<00:01:12.990> or

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
shampooed but like maybe every other or

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
shampooed but like maybe every other or
something<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.399> that<00:01:14.459> so<00:01:14.969> it<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:15.869> worked

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
something like that so it really worked

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.289 
something like that so it really worked
out<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.859> me<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.490> good<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> i<00:01:17.999> got<00:01:18.149> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
out for me really good and i got this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.679
