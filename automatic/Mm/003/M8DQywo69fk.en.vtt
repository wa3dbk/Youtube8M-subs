 dotcom episode 707 how to make a tutu 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.540
 or a ballerina skirt for your doll 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.900
 Elastic tulle materials and scissors 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.150
 Optional decorative element and ribbon 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.760
 hello hello today we are going to do these 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 cute skirts for your dolls and we're going to 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.640
 use a piece of tulle here I have tulle 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.040
 of different colors and the price is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 well reasonable to me it cost me 50 cents 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.559
 for each of the pieces they see in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.470
 screen I'm going now to choose the color that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.320
 I want and after this I will take my 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.690
 elastic I'm going to take my wrist and I'm going to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.770
 cut out a piece of elastic so 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.080
 use it as the base of the skirt 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.780
 I'm going to flip the elastic two 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.710
 times in the tummy of the wrist and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.600
 then I'm going to cut 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.760
 once I have already taken the elastic 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.280
 so now I'm going to take the piece of 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.000
 tulle that I 'm going to use I 'm going to double my 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.950
 tulle this way and then I will take 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.400
 my doll and I'm going to put it on top of 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.460
 tulle 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.430
 and I'm going to cut from the belly of 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.290
 the doll almost to the feet like that I'm going to 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.080
 have much more material with which I 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.810
 I can work 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.480
 and then I'm going to do the same thing again 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.760
 with another piece of tulle 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.910
 and if I want to add different tulle 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.580
 colors I only do the same thing and I take 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.240
 another piece of tulle of another color and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.180
 cut out 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.829
 now let's cut out strips of 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.680
 piece of tulle that we had trimmed 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.170
 before and while thinner and 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.960
 the more careful we have when 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.140
 we cut the strips much better will be the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.330
 final result once we have our 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.159
 tuna ready then we can take 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.619
 our adhesive tape put a deadline 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.319
 elastic and then use the turn to 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.569
 start forming the skirt I'm going to 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.860
 start by taking a piece of tulle can 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 make a loop on the top 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.140
 then I take the tips in the part of 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.150
 down and I just have to throw and 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.340
 accommodate the piece of tulle on my ribbon 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.640
 I keep doing the same procedure 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.860
 until filling the entire skirt 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.380
 that was the first method the second 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.690
 method is to use the elastic and put it 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.380
 on the hips of the wrist and then 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.959
 make a knot in the front and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.630
 then trim the excess in this way 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.820
 let's get a circle or the base 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.800
 for our skirt and what we're going to 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.040
 do after trimming the excess is 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.750
 take the elastic of our wrist and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.930
 start doing the same procedure 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.430
 what we had done previously 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.950
 we just take the elastic one 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.200
 piece of tulle we make a loop in the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.910
 top part and then we take the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.390
 tips of the bottom part and the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.780
 we went through and then we squeezed and adjusted 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.550
 the tulle on our piece of elastic and 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.470
 if we want we can repeat the same 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.290
 procedure using a color 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.180
 different or the same color in this case 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.580
 I will use a different color I 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.820
 a loop then I pass the tips through the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.280
 tight loop and then accommodate that is 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.260
 all very simple and once we have 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.640
 stuffed the entire skirt if we want 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.040
 cover the knot we had made 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.090
 previously we simply take a 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.269
 piece of tulle 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.030
 and we cover the knot using the tulle 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.250
 going from the outside to the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.250
 part of inside and then making a 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.680
 small little knot and tulle is not seen and not 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.200
 you see the knot on top 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.409
 and then if we want we can cut the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.150
 excess in the length of the skirt or if 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.340
 we want we can also put 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.489
 different types of elements 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.590
 decorative and here we have already the skirt 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.530

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.239

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.259
 pink and black colors I have also done 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.180
