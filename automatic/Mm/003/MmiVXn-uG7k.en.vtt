 the young charlotte went to school mozart to make a 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.510
 club presentation 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.139
 chris mcsorley captivating all the tension of the audience by these spike 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.579
 decorated with videos 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.029
 these charges of presentation which of course encompassed the aspect and sport 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.569
 dics to studies 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.739
 and who in better position than jean daubigny to evoke this subject m the defender 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.959
 thomas following his university studies while being about I 

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:31.119
 serve me 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.150
 the students were of a whole life almost admiring in front of this example of 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.250
 athletic and academic success 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.430
 as we confirm, they form the school director of the school 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.420
 when we started to tune in a bit of that the idea was really 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 to leave so quickly 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 for sport and studies and how we do 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.870
 succeed as much in sports as in studies john gobbi is an example 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 magnificent example what he follows from university studies in Geneva does 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540
 are not easy will not be easy 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.030
 at the same time he is an excellent player a pillar of the test with fire 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660
 it was wonderful 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.450
 it's an immense pleasure a very very great success 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.840
 the windows were translated into construction 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.480
 besides people say or think thank and thank everyone and 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.970
 I think it was really a 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.010
 a very nice event for chipboard I hope for the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.010
 om player who came 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.230
 some of your impressions the whole audience not so good by almost the 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.350
 star to the players 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.250
 not impressive enough 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.110
 French side no Roma 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.300
 I did not know he was so tall 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.350
 alas it is super lot 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 we could also receive normally 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.349
 after the presentation difficult to make more enthusiastic than some 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.569
 students meet all these criteria 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.760
 she is the first time hard ever imagined 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.799
 no i met one day the the gym 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.649
 it is an incredible experience 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.649
 for me it's great fun to have experienced this case 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.009
 charest had massively during this attack 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:43.409
 this referral m 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.499
 more since he was a little bit with him did things sign these 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.579
 Mayan signs 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.539
 on the way the gateways can ask questions 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.539
 athletically it's called match 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.979
 but it's not the same and we'll never forget there have been some 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.289
 low prices 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.839
 but it may be a little awakening of the investments in the paper closing its 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.919
 part indicated the n 3 by sms arrived at the ol 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.619
 you signed for such an appointment now or never 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.209
 - 21:25 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.209
 we still have a year 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.459
 for months he kissed his father 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.459
 we all try 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.169
 this one 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.409
 after giving up 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.689
 we will talk with him 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.439
 baptist 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.439
 and then that does not really feel communicated 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.919
 it's my dream is to play in selection 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.629
 so I made six deaths for the smaller cars and it's a flying 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.019
 it's dakar sell 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.319
 hear this overwhelming enthusiasm of mozart school students watching 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.590
 everywhere it will probably not be the most symptomatic of the genocide
