00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
to do things a lot more efficiently

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.930 
to do things a lot more efficiently
instead<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.699> kind

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
instead of me going out there and kind

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360 
instead of me going out there and kind
of<00:01:00.000> winging<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> speaking<00:01:01.309> there's<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of winging it so to speaking there's a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.039
