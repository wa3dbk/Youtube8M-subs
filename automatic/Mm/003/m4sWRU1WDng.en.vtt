00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
in captivity for too long they don't

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.490 
in captivity for too long they don't
survive<00:01:54.570> too<00:01:54.840> long<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> world

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
survive too long out in the world

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.959 
survive too long out in the world
there's<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> few<00:01:56.040> reasons<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
there's a few reasons for that but the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.929 
there's a few reasons for that but the
main<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.549> that

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
main one that they think is because that

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.880 
main one that they think is because that
they<00:02:00.600> gangnet<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> lot<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> their<00:02:01.380> toxins

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
they gangnet a lot of their toxins

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.990 
they gangnet a lot of their toxins
although<00:02:02.130> they're<00:02:02.280> poison<00:02:02.700> although<00:02:02.880> their

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
although they're poison although their

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.170 
although they're poison although their
venom<00:02:03.409> from<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> natural<00:02:05.310> wild<00:02:05.790> food<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
venom from the natural wild food that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.880 
venom from the natural wild food that
they<00:02:06.270> eat<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.110> anything<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.799> in

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
they eat and anything they get in

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.199 
they eat and anything they get in
captivity<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.610> doesn't<00:02:08.849> provide<00:02:09.149> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
captivity just doesn't provide that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.660 
captivity just doesn't provide that
toxin<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.959> them<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.319> bit<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.890> poison<00:02:11.550> arrow

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
toxin for them a bit like poison arrow

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.150 
toxin for them a bit like poison arrow
folks<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.209> do

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
folks would do

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800 
folks would do
also<00:02:13.730> another<00:02:13.910> interesting<00:02:14.360> fact<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.720> that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
also another interesting fact is that

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.020 
also another interesting fact is that
these<00:02:14.930> guys<00:02:15.170> whenever<00:02:15.620> they<00:02:15.740> call<00:02:16.010> they<00:02:16.730> never

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
these guys whenever they call they never

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.100 
these guys whenever they call they never
have<00:02:17.240> any<00:02:17.510> sort<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.170> fleas<00:02:18.590> or<00:02:19.100> any<00:02:19.250> sort<00:02:19.460> of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
have any sort of fleas or any sort of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.750 
have any sort of fleas or any sort of
insects<00:02:21.110> inside<00:02:21.620> their<00:02:21.830> skin<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.340> attacking

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
insects inside their skin or attacking

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.500 
insects inside their skin or attacking
them<00:02:22.880> or<00:02:22.940> anything<00:02:23.090> like<00:02:23.270> that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
them or anything like that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.180 
them or anything like that
and<00:02:23.720> again<00:02:24.260> that's<00:02:24.440> thought<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:24.860> down<00:02:25.010> to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and again that's thought to be down to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.720 
and again that's thought to be down to
the<00:02:25.760> venom<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.210> poison<00:02:26.720> as<00:02:27.680> well<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.610> we

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
the venom of the poison as well but we

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.260 
the venom of the poison as well but we
are<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.120> lucky<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.510> see<00:02:29.840> those<00:02:30.020> guys
