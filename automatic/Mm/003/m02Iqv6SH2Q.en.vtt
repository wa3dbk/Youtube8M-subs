00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.359

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.250
 minecraft today we are in the tutorial of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.840
 how to make a motorcycle in minecraft without box 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.540
 and what do we need for it, then 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.449
 very simple steps that right now you 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.619
 I will explain so let's do it what 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.689
 first thing you have to do is install 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.460
 wood much wood everything what is all 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.130
 the wood that you see all the trees what 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 you are with your diamond ax if 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.670
 it does not work with that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.219
 you go to hayes tnt you put it on all 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.590
 forest and fires until you pledge 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.870
 everything and exploit the whole forest to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.810
 take all the wood all the wood 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.350
 see all of them all 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.350
 now 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.480
 if we go there I want wood 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.739
 I want model I will explode the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.210
 computer but nothing happens nothing happens 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.680
 when I have already collected all the wood and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.660
 you have 8,000 in your inventory 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.330
 millions of trillions of wood because no 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.440
 16 for nothing so the strip is on 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.110
 a very big hole that you have made 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.239
 to infinity and beyond you are pulling 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.950
 All we will not see anything alone 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.100
 we want a little bit a table 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.510
 funny point when you have thrown all 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.340
 the wood you will have to do this 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.500
 structure that I have done here that has 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.750
 under the table and nodded a block of 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.530
 these of resistÃ³n also corresponded other 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.570
 block the rest 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.060
 again he raised berries around 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.270
 rest lamps and sand of souls 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.020
 when you have done this we move on to 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.610
 next step next step you have to 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.619
 have these materials that I have now 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 same in the inventory you go to the 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.570
 table the fret from below to the one above 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.700
 no one down and put the armor on 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.469
 horse gold in the middle 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.810
 sticks of mails on the sides the coal 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.299
 behind torches that are going to be the lights 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.299
 of the bike on the sides and a lever 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.179
 for the bike and here is this beautiful 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.759
 motorcycle that you see here so we're going to 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.829
 try it and well I'm here with the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.229
 moto truth is that it is very uncomfortable 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.569
 can go through the water either that there is not 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.909
 a lot of professional depth second and 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.310
 Well, we're going through a lot of land 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.540
 you can do jumps with it you can 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.610
 do everything the truth is that it is a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.500
 pretty comfortable bike so I hope that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.290
