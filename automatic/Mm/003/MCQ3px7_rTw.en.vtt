00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.130 

next<00:02:58.440> we<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.740> our<00:02:58.920> leaf<00:02:59.670> with<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.140> branch

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
next we have our leaf with the branch

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.050 
next we have our leaf with the branch
with<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.350> smaller<00:03:01.680> leaves<00:03:01.980> we're<00:03:02.880> going<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
with the smaller leaves we're going to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.540 
with the smaller leaves we're going to
use<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.360> with<00:03:03.510> red<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.020> black<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.370> use

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
use that with red and black you can use

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.820 
use that with red and black you can use
the<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.030> bigger<00:03:06.210> leaves<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.780> for<00:03:07.200> red<00:03:07.410> but

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
the the bigger leaves one for red but

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.310 
the the bigger leaves one for red but
I'm<00:03:08.580> just<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.060> use<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.360> one<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
I'm just going to use this one is it a

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:37.790 
I'm just going to use this one is it a
cooler<00:03:10.530> look<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.920> think<00:03:36.440> all<00:03:37.440> right<00:03:37.560> for<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
cooler look I think all right for the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.760 
cooler look I think all right for the
final<00:03:38.100> color<00:03:38.250> we're<00:03:38.460> going<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.640> go<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:38.910> black

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
final color we're going to go with black

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.220 
final color we're going to go with black
you<00:03:40.770> can<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.400> use<00:03:41.640> brown<00:03:42.270> or<00:03:42.540> black<00:03:42.900> I

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
you can you can use brown or black I

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.960 
you can you can use brown or black I
just<00:03:43.530> like<00:03:43.680> black<00:03:43.980> because<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:44.490> I<00:03:44.580> loot<00:03:44.790> use

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
just like black because if I loot use

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.240 
just like black because if I loot use
brown<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> look<00:03:45.720> too<00:03:45.870> much<00:03:45.990> like<00:03:46.050> fall<00:03:47.600> and

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
brown and I look too much like fall and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.560 
brown and I look too much like fall and
the<00:03:50.250> black<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.240> guess<00:03:51.750> wood<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> trees

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
the black is I guess wood for the trees

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.430 
the black is I guess wood for the trees
use<00:03:54.570> black<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.230> brown<00:03:56.270> just<00:03:57.440> experiment

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
use black and brown just experiment

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.630 
use black and brown just experiment
we're<00:03:59.340> using<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.790> small<00:04:00.180> leaf<00:04:00.390> again<00:04:01.640> for

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
we're using the small leaf again for

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:15.110 
we're using the small leaf again for
this<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:13.770> black<00:04:13.980> could<00:04:14.190> also<00:04:14.340> be<00:04:14.580> smoked<00:04:14.910> I

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
this the black could also be smoked I

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:41.590 
this the black could also be smoked I
guess

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.260 
product we don't have good light right
now<00:04:46.889> so<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.460> looks<00:04:47.490> different<00:04:47.729> than<00:04:48.120> it

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
now so it looks different than it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.909 
now so it looks different than it
wouldn't<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.630> light<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.500> when<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.740> dries
