00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.919
 during our restyled test 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 patriots we talked about being updated 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.700
 not just the car itself 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.559
 well and its production we arrived at 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.820
 Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant in order 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.990
 to see what is here 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.990
 really changed 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.039
 UAZ is probably the only patriot 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.810
 domestic car that can 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.029
 boast that much 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.590
 update improvements almost once a 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.750
 a year or even half a year from Ulyanovsk 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.849
 come news about the introduction of new nodes 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.860
 or applying new technologies on 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.350
 production is nothing 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.480
 surprising you have a plant with relatively 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.089
 modest output volumes therefore 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.409
 instant global reconstruction 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.780
 he simply can't do it 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.360
 one remains to smoothly upgrade 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.620
 existing production base 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.000
 the main goal of the transformation on the Oise 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.089
 now increasing efficiency 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.769
 production and cost savings for 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.049
 recently installed at the factory 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.059
 new colorful line and modernized 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.920
 Punching Complex Launch New 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.140
 punching lines will allow to produce 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.970
 whole body sides if coloring 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.340
 complex aizerman work give already 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.770
 long ago there is a modern waste of useful 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.630
 not she portal priming plant factory 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.909
 I found it just now so we will 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.159
 hope that now UAZ kindle not 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.020
 I will be wondering what the main problems are 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.689
 associated with the modernization of production 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.880
 are not even financing but in 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.060
 that new lines are needed 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.560
 install in old factory buildings 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.900
 original not designed for like 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.770
 Equipment is not stopping 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.740
 main conveyor 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.510
 This experience can be called unique 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.400
 directly got a new conveyor 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.570
 assembly areas and modern 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.760
 equipment plus to this 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.659
 changed the system of internal destyaki not 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.280
 quality control 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.380
 the length of the conveyor has doubled 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.610
 the arrangement of operations has changed 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.590
 assembly tool 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.420
 equipping jobs new approach 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.580
 production is noticeable at least because 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.060
 on the body began to install protective 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.310
 housings 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.979
 so that during the assembly worker did not hurt 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.930
 paint coating factory created 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.409
 unified assembly logistics complex 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.690
 an area of ​​25 thousand square meters all 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.820
 warehouses were reorganized 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.580
 and concentrated around assembly 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.310
 conveyors which allowed to provide 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.290
 efficient and efficient logistics 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.569
 revolution did not happen but evolution on 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 face nice to see what the plant 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.739
 working on self and quality 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.810
 products after all otherwise 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.000
 today's market simply does not survive 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.330
 we will wait for the next news from 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.330
 Ulyanovsk
