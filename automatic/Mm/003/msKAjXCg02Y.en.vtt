you<00:00:21.420> are<00:00:21.539> killing<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.590> jungle<00:00:23.310> camps<00:00:24.000> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
you are killing the jungle camps that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.450 
you are killing the jungle camps that
you<00:00:24.269> should<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.539> killing<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.109> minis<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you should be killing the minis first so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.339 
you should be killing the minis first so
that<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> isolation<00:00:27.900> damage<00:00:28.199> on

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that you get the isolation damage on

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
that you get the isolation damage on
your<00:00:28.380> cue<00:00:28.769> onto<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> big<00:00:30.029> creep<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.050> camp

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
your cue onto the big creep in the camp

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.190 
your cue onto the big creep in the camp
now<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.700> say<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.200> complete

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
now this is like I say a complete

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.100 
now this is like I say a complete
misconception<00:00:34.460> it's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.360> true<00:00:36.719> mean<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
misconception it's just not true mean it

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.959 
misconception it's just not true mean it
doesn't<00:00:37.559> benefit<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> any<00:00:38.309> way<00:00:38.399> shape<00:00:38.790> or

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
doesn't benefit you in any way shape or

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.660 
doesn't benefit you in any way shape or
form<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.600> theory<00:00:40.050> behind<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.860> by

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
form the theory behind it is that by

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.880 
form the theory behind it is that by
killing<00:00:41.730> those<00:00:42.329> minis<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
killing those minis you then get the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
killing those minis you then get the
isolation<00:00:44.340> damage<00:00:44.610> off<00:00:44.760> onto<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> big<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
isolation damage off onto the big one so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.100 
isolation damage off onto the big one so
you<00:00:45.809> kill<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:46.640> faster<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.450> practice

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you kill it down faster but in practice

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.279 
you kill it down faster but in practice
what's<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> happen<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
what's going to have to happen is that

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.110 
what's going to have to happen is that
the<00:00:52.289> jungle<00:00:52.649> camps<00:00:52.949> only<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> 13<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the jungle camps only have 13 and that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.240 
the jungle camps only have 13 and that
that<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> big<00:00:55.079> million<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.980> minis

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that is this big million here the minis

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
that is this big million here the minis
they're<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> threat<00:00:56.699> whatsoever<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.480> want

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
they're not a threat whatsoever you want

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
they're not a threat whatsoever you want
to<00:00:57.750> kill<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.320> whatever<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.309> biggest

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
to kill what is whatever is the biggest

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.860 
to kill what is whatever is the biggest
threat<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:00.539> too

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
threat or so you're going to take too

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
threat or so you're going to take too
much<00:01:00.989> damage<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:02.010> normally<00:01:02.640> you'll<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.059> go

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
much damage so normally you'll just go

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
much damage so normally you'll just go
face-first<00:01:03.510> into<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.949> big<00:01:05.250> monster

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
face-first into the big monster

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.740 
face-first into the big monster
obviously<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
obviously because that's the one you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
obviously because that's the one you
want<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.020> kill<00:01:07.140> first<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> argument<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
want to kill first but the argument is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.830 
want to kill first but the argument is
that<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.909> Kazakhs<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> benefits

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that with Kazakhs because it benefits

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
that with Kazakhs because it benefits
from<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.439> isolation<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> might<00:01:12.299> actually

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
from this isolation you might actually

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
from this isolation you might actually
want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.900> into<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> minis<00:01:13.530> first<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
want to go into the minis first and so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
want to go into the minis first and so
then<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.670> kill<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> faster<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.960> your

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
then you can kill it faster with your

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.100 
then you can kill it faster with your
isolated<00:01:16.530> q<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.930> only

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
isolated q the way that is that only

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
isolated q the way that is that only
going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> work<00:01:19.950> whether<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.880> because

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
going to work whether is that because

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.850 
going to work whether is that because
you<00:01:21.600> loved<00:01:21.780> spending<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.200> killing<00:01:22.770> these

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you loved spending time killing these

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.130 
you loved spending time killing these
minis<00:01:23.250> first<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> wild<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> big<00:01:24.720> wire<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
minis first all the wild the big wire is

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
minis first all the wild the big wire is
beating<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> doing<00:01:26.189> damage<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
beating on you and doing damage to you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
beating on you and doing damage to you
the<00:01:27.299> time<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> spend<00:01:28.380> killing<00:01:28.920> these

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the time that you spend killing these

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.190 
the time that you spend killing these
minis<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.630> made<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.170> by

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
minis is going to have to be made up by

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.640 
minis is going to have to be made up by
the<00:01:31.500> fact<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.920> you're<00:01:32.369> isolated<00:01:33.090> Q<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.720> going

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the fact that you're isolated Q is going

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.010 
the fact that you're isolated Q is going
to<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.009> speedy<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.030> makes<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
to be so speedy that it makes up for it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.069 
to be so speedy that it makes up for it
basically<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.090> this<00:01:39.090> isn't<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.600> mean<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
basically and this isn't I mean it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
basically and this isn't I mean it
doesn't<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> doesn't<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.490> enough<00:01:41.579> damage<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
doesn't it doesn't do enough damage to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.819 
doesn't it doesn't do enough damage to
make<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.619> be

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
make up for it and I'm just going to be

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.910 
much health I'm going to be on by doing
it<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> I'm<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.649> I'm<00:02:01.770> just

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it so I'm this for this one I'm just

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880 
it so I'm this for this one I'm just
going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> go<00:02:02.130> face-first<00:02:02.520> into<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.930> big<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
going to go face-first into the big the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.670 
going to go face-first into the big the
big<00:02:04.920> big<00:02:05.759> menu<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> go<00:02:07.500> do

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
big big menu and then I'm going to go do

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.830 
big big menu and then I'm going to go do
it<00:02:07.710> from<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> other<00:02:08.670> point<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.030> view<00:02:09.179> going

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
it from the other point of view going

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710 
it from the other point of view going
into<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.379> mini<00:02:11.129> minions<00:02:11.670> first<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.209> step

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
into the mini minions first and step

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.930 
into the mini minions first and step
so<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.930> took<00:02:14.110> me<00:02:14.170> roughly<00:02:14.560> 15<00:02:15.160> seconds<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.880> I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
so this took me roughly 15 seconds and I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.320 
so this took me roughly 15 seconds and I
took<00:02:16.000> around<00:02:16.920> 250<00:02:17.920> damage<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:18.880> let's<00:02:19.090> take<00:02:19.210> a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
took around 250 damage now let's take a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.690 
took around 250 damage now let's take a
look<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.660> how<00:02:19.870> long<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.080> would<00:02:20.290> take<00:02:20.350> by<00:02:21.280> doing

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
look at how long it would take by doing

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.440 
look at how long it would take by doing
it<00:02:22.030> by<00:02:22.690> taking<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.140> minis<00:02:23.470> first<00:02:23.770> instead<00:02:24.450> now

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it by taking the minis first instead now

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.340 
it by taking the minis first instead now
this<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.660> going<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> be<00:02:25.900> from<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> point<00:02:26.230> of

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
this is going to be from the point of

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.590 
this is going to be from the point of
view<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.560> taking<00:02:27.010> down<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.370> mini<00:02:27.700> minions

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
view of taking down the mini minions

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.510 
view of taking down the mini minions
first<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.110> even<00:02:29.800> those<00:02:29.890> are<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.220> different

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
first and even those are the different

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.070 
first and even those are the different
camp<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.910> am<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.150> same<00:02:31.330> level<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.900> same

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
camp I am the same level of the same

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.290 
camp I am the same level of the same
stats<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.980> red<00:02:33.580> buff<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:34.000> has<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
stats and this red buff here has the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.850 
stats and this red buff here has the
same<00:02:34.510> stats<00:02:34.780> as<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.050> one<00:02:35.200> before<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.740> is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
same stats as the one before so this is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.490 
same stats as the one before so this is
going<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.600> similar<00:02:37.600> exercise<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.410> i'm

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
going to be a similar exercise and i'm

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.230 
going to be a similar exercise and i'm
going<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.650> start<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.070> off<00:02:39.220> at<00:02:39.400> 17<00:02:39.910> minutes

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
going to start this off at 17 minutes

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.360 
going to start this off at 17 minutes
and<00:02:40.480> we'll<00:02:41.050> see<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.650> i'm<00:02:41.740> taking<00:02:41.920> away<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
and we'll see so i'm taking away the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.780 
and we'll see so i'm taking away the
mini<00:02:42.580> ones<00:02:42.850> first<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:44.770> get<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.190> isolated

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
mini ones first to get this isolated

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:57.660 
mini ones first to get this isolated
damage<00:02:46.180> off<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.770> big<00:02:47.920> one<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.489> this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
damage off on to the big one so this

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.670 
damage off on to the big one so this
took<00:02:57.850> me<00:02:57.910> around<00:02:58.180> two<00:02:58.959> or<00:02:58.989> three<00:02:59.350> seconds

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
took me around two or three seconds

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.580 
took me around two or three seconds
longer<00:02:59.920> than<00:03:00.040> before<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.700> i<00:03:00.970> actually<00:03:01.150> took

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
longer than before and i actually took

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.800 
longer than before and i actually took
about<00:03:02.590> three<00:03:03.130> hundred<00:03:03.160> damage<00:03:04.150> by<00:03:04.360> doing<00:03:04.690> this

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
about three hundred damage by doing this

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.630 
about three hundred damage by doing this
the<00:03:05.110> reason<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.530> reason<00:03:05.980> why<00:03:06.100> i<00:03:06.130> took<00:03:06.220> more

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the reason for reason why i took more

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.699 
the reason for reason why i took more
damage<00:03:07.030> than<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.780> previous<00:03:08.230> clear<00:03:08.410> which<00:03:08.560> if

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
damage than the previous clear which if

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.320 
damage than the previous clear which if
you<00:03:08.800> remember<00:03:08.890> took<00:03:09.310> me<00:03:09.430> about<00:03:09.580> 15<00:03:10.000> seconds

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
you remember took me about 15 seconds

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.620 
you remember took me about 15 seconds
and<00:03:10.600> took<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.260> did<00:03:11.680> 250<00:03:12.640> damage<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.000> me<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
and took and did 250 damage to me the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.120 
and took and did 250 damage to me the
decided<00:03:14.020> more<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.350> because<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.709> took<00:03:14.800> me<00:03:14.950> so

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
decided more is because it took me so

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.460 
decided more is because it took me so
long<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.340> kill<00:03:15.670> those<00:03:15.880> minis<00:03:16.239> all<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.080> wildest

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
long to kill those minis all the wildest

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.870 
long to kill those minis all the wildest
big<00:03:17.500> guy<00:03:17.799> was<00:03:17.950> beating<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.400> me<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
big guy was beating on me and the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.479 
big guy was beating on me and the
isolated<00:03:19.420> q<00:03:19.660> damage<00:03:19.989> bonus<00:03:20.200> wasn't<00:03:21.100> enough<00:03:21.340> to

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
isolated q damage bonus wasn't enough to

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.250 
isolated q damage bonus wasn't enough to
make<00:03:21.640> up<00:03:21.820> for<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:22.060> i<00:03:22.120> was<00:03:22.150> but<00:03:22.510> didn't<00:03:22.870> kill<00:03:23.140> it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
make up for it i was but didn't kill it

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.920 
make up for it i was but didn't kill it
fast<00:03:23.590> enough<00:03:23.769> by<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.190> being<00:03:24.430> isolated<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:25.750> make

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
fast enough by it being isolated to make

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.560 
fast enough by it being isolated to make
it<00:03:26.110> worthwhile<00:03:26.640> now<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.670> know<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.910> showcase<00:03:28.420> this

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
it worthwhile now I know I showcase this

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.410 
it worthwhile now I know I showcase this

do<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.880> red<00:03:34.000> buff<00:03:34.120> because<00:03:34.209> that's<00:03:34.450> your

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
do on the red buff because that's your

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.120 
do on the red buff because that's your
trick<00:03:34.720> where<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:34.930> can<00:03:35.080> pull<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.470> if<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.980> pull

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
trick where you can pull it if you pull

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.949 
trick where you can pull it if you pull
the<00:03:36.310> big<00:03:36.459> red<00:03:36.519> buff<00:03:36.850> here<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:37.810> actually

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
the big red buff here you can actually

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.720 
the big red buff here you can actually
isolate<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.650> without<00:03:38.830> killing<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.250> minis<00:03:39.489> but

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
isolate it without killing the minis but

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.190 
isolate it without killing the minis but
this<00:03:39.850> was<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.269> demonstration<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:41.049> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
this was just a demonstration of the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.180 
this was just a demonstration of the
theory<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:41.950> concept<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:44.650> even

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
theory of the concept and it's even

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.400 
theory of the concept and it's even
worse<00:03:45.519> if<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.880> do<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.150> for<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.720> Wraith<00:03:47.110> camp

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
worse if you do it for the Wraith camp

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.750 
worse if you do it for the Wraith camp
because<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.769> has<00:03:47.920> three<00:03:48.280> minutes<00:03:48.610> that<00:03:48.730> you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
because that has three minutes that you

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.430 
because that has three minutes that you
need<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.060> kill<00:03:49.239> it's<00:03:49.720> pretty<00:03:49.900> much<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.230> same

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
need to kill it's pretty much the same

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.060 
need to kill it's pretty much the same
if<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.739> do<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.700> wolfcamp<00:03:52.239> and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
if you do it on the wolfcamp and

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.110 
if you do it on the wolfcamp and
obviously<00:03:54.070> there<00:03:54.280> are<00:03:54.310> no<00:03:54.400> minute<00:03:54.640> isolated

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
obviously there are no minute isolated

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.660 
obviously there are no minute isolated
on<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.239> white<00:03:55.330> camper<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.410> only<00:03:56.769> exception<00:03:57.489> I

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
on the white camper the only exception I

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.310 
on the white camper the only exception I
would<00:03:57.820> say<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.030> this<00:03:58.209> rule<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.570> possibly<00:03:59.110> on

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
would say to this rule is possibly on

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.860 
would say to this rule is possibly on
the<00:03:59.350> golems<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.880> but<00:04:00.880> even<00:04:01.120> then<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.480> reasons

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
the golems and but even then it reasons

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.810 
the golems and but even then it reasons
make<00:04:02.019> any<00:04:02.230> difference<00:04:02.500> basically<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.430> the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
make any difference basically this the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.270 
make any difference basically this the
more<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.570> story<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.590> doesn't<00:04:06.100> matter

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
more of the story is it doesn't matter

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.460 
more of the story is it doesn't matter
about<00:04:06.580> killing<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.269> minis<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.870> isolate<00:04:08.320> your

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
about killing the minis to isolate your

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.440 
about killing the minis to isolate your
queue<00:04:08.769> in<00:04:08.920> fact<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:09.400> actually<00:04:09.549> worse<00:04:10.090> for

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
queue in fact it's actually worse for

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.759 
queue in fact it's actually worse for
you<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.600> be<00:04:10.690> doing<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.110> lets<00:04:11.260> go<00:04:11.320> face-first

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
you to be doing it lets go face-first

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.910 
you to be doing it lets go face-first
into<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.910> big<00:04:13.180> creep<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.690> kill<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.620> as<00:04:14.709> fast

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
into the big creep and kill it as fast

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.740 
into the big creep and kill it as fast
as<00:04:15.100> possible<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:16.209> that's<00:04:16.359> what<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:16.510> want<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.690> do

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
as possible so that's what I want to do

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.120 
as possible so that's what I want to do
