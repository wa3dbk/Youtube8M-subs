by<00:01:21.659> drawing<00:01:22.080> an<00:01:22.290> O<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.549> flashlight<00:01:24.060> by

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
by drawing an O or the flashlight by

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
by drawing an O or the flashlight by
drawing<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.720> V<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.310> where<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.580> double<00:01:26.880> tap

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
drawing a V so where the double tap

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.819 
drawing a V so where the double tap
seems<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.600> working<00:01:28.020> fine<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:29.310> usual<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.829> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
seems to be working fine as usual and it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.030 
seems to be working fine as usual and it
is<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.280> useful<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.030> use<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.890> can

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
is very useful to use that as you can

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.980 
is very useful to use that as you can
see<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:35.939> through<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.450> dialer

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
see there just going through the dialer

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.420 
see there just going through the dialer
and<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> nice

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
and we can see here we get the nice

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.840 
and we can see here we get the nice
interface<00:01:42.500> which<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.530> very<00:01:43.950> nice<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> stuck

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
interface which is very nice and stuck

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.700 
interface which is very nice and stuck
here<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:46.340> we<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:48.259> we<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.290> quickly

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
here and we can see we can quickly

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.719 
here and we can see we can quickly
search<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.460> contact<00:01:50.729> using<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.479> search

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.730 
so I definitely recommend that you give
this<00:06:09.160> a<00:06:09.220> try<00:06:09.540> as<00:06:10.540> long<00:06:10.780> as<00:06:10.870> you<00:06:10.960> don't<00:06:11.110> need<00:06:11.410> the

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
this a try as long as you don't need the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.460
