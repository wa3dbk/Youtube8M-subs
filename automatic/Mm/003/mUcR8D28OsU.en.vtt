funny<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> walls<00:01:56.430> done

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
funny to say but it's on the walls done

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330 
funny to say but it's on the walls done
baseboard<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.140> almost<00:01:58.320> seems<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.040> lot<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
baseboard it almost seems like a lot of

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.950 
baseboard it almost seems like a lot of
people<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.909> they<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.299> put<00:02:00.450> cocking

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
people think they can just put cocking

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
people think they can just put cocking
on<00:02:01.079> their<00:02:01.320> run<00:02:01.860> their<00:02:02.040> finger<00:02:02.369> over<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.909> be

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
on their run their finger over it and be

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.700 
on their run their finger over it and be
done<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.600> can't<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> wipe

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
done you can't do that you have to wipe

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.980 
done you can't do that you have to wipe
it<00:02:04.890> off<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.369> rag<00:02:05.579> or<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> sponge

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it off with the rag or with the sponge

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.800 
it off with the rag or with the sponge
that<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:08.129> you're<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.789> only<00:02:09.030> getting

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that way you're really only getting

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
that way you're really only getting
into<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> gaps<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.489> wood

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
into the gaps and it's not on the wood

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.670 
into the gaps and it's not on the wood
it's<00:02:11.880> not<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> walls<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.840> when<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.380> paint

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's not on the walls and when you paint

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.130 
it's not on the walls and when you paint
it<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.010> looks<00:02:14.190> much<00:02:14.400> nicer<00:02:14.720> because<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:15.989> I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it it looks much nicer because if I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.440 
it it looks much nicer because if I
haven't<00:02:16.560> done<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.880> cocking<00:02:18.300> was

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
haven't done that and the cocking was

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.630 
haven't done that and the cocking was
still<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.050> would<00:02:19.380> once<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.220> gets<00:02:20.370> painted

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
still on this would once it gets painted

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.309 
still on this would once it gets painted
you're<00:02:20.970> going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.260> to

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
you're going to see that you're going to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
you're going to see that you're going to
see<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> cocking<00:02:23.130> wasn't<00:02:23.550> put<00:02:24.030> in

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
see that the cocking wasn't put in

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.780 
see that the cocking wasn't put in
properly<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.980> that's<00:02:26.130> pretty<00:02:26.340> much<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.670> you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
properly so that's pretty much what you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.000 
properly so that's pretty much what you
have<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.180> all<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.170> way<00:02:28.319> along<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.860> you're

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
sponge and renting it out because once

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
have to use the brush to actually

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.860 
have to use the brush to actually
individually<00:04:45.610> do<00:04:45.820> each<00:04:46.090> one<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.630> lines

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.300 
the roller doesn't get the paint in
there<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.750> then<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:50.830> have<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.040> go<00:04:51.130> back

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
there and then you have to go back

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.850 
there and then you have to go back
through<00:04:51.580> with<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.790> brush<00:04:52.350> doesn't<00:04:53.350> look<00:04:53.590> bad

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
through with the brush doesn't look bad

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.990 
through with the brush doesn't look bad
when<00:04:54.190> you're<00:04:54.310> looking<00:04:54.520> at<00:04:54.640> it<00:04:54.790> through<00:04:54.940> the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000

when you're looking at it through the
camera<00:04:55.240> right<00:04:55.540> now<00:04:55.600> but<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.230> really<00:04:56.650> don't<00:04:56.860> like

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
camera right now but I really don't like

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.220

how<00:04:57.340> it's<00:04:57.520> coming<00:04:57.730> out<00:04:57.970> I<00:04:58.000> kind<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.420> want<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.080> to

how it's coming out I kind of want it to

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.200 
how it's coming out I kind of want it to
be<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.380> real<00:04:59.650> nice<00:04:59.830> smooth<00:05:00.310> texture<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.180> the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
be a real nice smooth texture and the

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.720 
be a real nice smooth texture and the
roller<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.780> got<00:05:02.080> was<00:05:02.290> for<00:05:02.560> smooth<00:05:02.800> surfaces<00:05:03.490> but

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
roller I got was for smooth surfaces but

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.200 
roller I got was for smooth surfaces but
it<00:05:03.910> kind<00:05:04.450> of<00:05:04.510> coming<00:05:04.810> out<00:05:05.310> looking<00:05:06.310> textured<00:05:07.000> a

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
it kind of coming out looking textured a

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.240 
it kind of coming out looking textured a
little<00:05:07.810> bit<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:08.080> i<00:05:08.110> think<00:05:08.200> i<00:05:08.530> might<00:05:08.770> call<00:05:09.100> it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
little bit so i think i might call it

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.480 
little bit so i think i might call it
quits<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:10.140> wait<00:05:11.140> till<00:05:11.380> tomorrow<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:12.190> i<00:05:12.310> have

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
quits and wait till tomorrow and i have

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
a spray gun back at our shop and I might

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.100

just<00:05:15.430> mask<00:05:15.850> everything<00:05:16.480> in<00:05:16.570> this<00:05:16.660> room<00:05:16.780> and

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110
