00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
that's going to help give you some hold

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.910 
that's going to help give you some hold
because<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.729> have<00:02:10.140> sprayed<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> product<00:02:11.769> on

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.319 
there that's specifically for hold and
then<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.590> lock<00:02:14.859> that<00:02:14.920> hold<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:15.579> heat<00:02:15.819> so

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
then you lock that hold in with heat so

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.520 
then you lock that hold in with heat so
you're<00:02:16.450> gonna<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.750> lot<00:02:16.930> more<00:02:16.959> hold<00:02:17.350> that

you're gonna get a lot more hold that
way<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:19.000> when<00:02:19.720> all<00:02:19.900> else<00:02:19.930> fails<00:02:20.940> give

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
way and when all else fails give

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.920 
way and when all else fails give
yourself<00:02:22.329> a<00:02:22.420> little<00:02:22.540> scalp<00:02:22.959> massage<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.780> you

can<00:02:29.079> really<00:02:29.290> plump<00:02:29.739> that<00:02:29.920> up<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.600> that's<00:02:31.780> how

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
can really plump that up so that's how

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.489
