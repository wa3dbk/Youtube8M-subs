00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
think is a nice feature because it kind

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.030 
think is a nice feature because it kind
of<00:01:28.530> matches<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.100> color<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.640> bag<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.750> a
