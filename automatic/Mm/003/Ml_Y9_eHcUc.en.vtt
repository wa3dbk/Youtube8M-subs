00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.740 
to get nail polish and I realized if you
switch<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.700> think<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.000> polished<00:03:54.450> lovers

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
switch to I think it's polished lovers

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.090 
switch to I think it's polished lovers
that<00:03:57.750> might<00:03:57.930> not<00:03:57.959> be<00:03:58.170> right<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.500> anyway<00:03:58.920> there

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
that might not be right but anyway there

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.130 
that might not be right but anyway there
is<00:03:59.220> one<00:03:59.489> category<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.810> nothing<00:04:00.959> but

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
is one category that is nothing but

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.870 
is one category that is nothing but
polish<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:01.920> don't<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.550> get<00:04:02.670> other

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
polish so you don't have to get other

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.870 
polish so you don't have to get other
