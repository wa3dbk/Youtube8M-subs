00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.870
 today in the morning as my partner still 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.850
 He slept and did not look for when he was going to 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.380
 wake up I started thinking about the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.690
 members of the group of friends that your 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.160
 health has deteriorated the most curious thing is 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.190
 that they all go to the doctor and not 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.929
 they improve then I asked myself what are 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.910
 the factors that alter the response of 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.189
 the drugs in the body like my 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.189
 friend the only thing he does is sleep I decided 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.220
 run out investigate it doctor no 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.930
 I know how to start my research 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.490
 quiet son the first thing you should 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.399
 to know is that the factors that you are 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.360
 looking are divided into five groups one 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.690
 factors linked to patient two 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.969
 factors linked to the drug three 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.370
 factors linked to the environment four 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.370
 factors linked to the interaction with 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.489
 other drugs and five factors linked 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.010
 to the veterinarian you can go with 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.079
 miami wellness for the first point he 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.140
 you can channel for others 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.420
 good luck are you the friend or if 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.790
 sure yes he must be the friend of the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.009
 doctor dmg who wants to know about 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.670
 the factors indicated to the patient as 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.670
 he knew they are 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.050
 The doctor did not tell me to tell me 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.510
 would reach someone with glasses like 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.280
 mine must take into account that they are 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.650
 many species that exist in the 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.080
 cage and that within each species are 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.180
 many the stripes that make it up 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.360
 Within each ray there are individuals 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.220
 that as individuals have are unique in 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.260
 the way of life 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.480
 all this complicates the doctors 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.610
 give a correct diagnosis so that 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.930
 we must take into account many aspects 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.030
 physiological genetic in order of many 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.909
 types 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.920
 one factor is the age when it is medicated 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.450
 very young animals these have not yet 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.030
 developed its bio mechanisms 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.040
 transformation and expression in those of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.940
 old age the deficiency of said 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.940
 decreases 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.299
 just placing the same and I do not get by 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.910
 other side the weight and the state 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.830
 nutritional play also a factor 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.319
 important the obese animals will be 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.030
 always difficult to anesthetize since 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.129
 the anesthetics are retained in the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.440
 fat the slender animals are 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.069
 intoxicated frequently with organs 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.220
 chlorinated and phosphorus-containing organs 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.400
 store these medications in fat 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.319
 I work for Minister Gordon 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.390
 I will need only the new ones this is so 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.010
 only all the factors are examples 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.250
 linked to the patient we believe about 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.760
 account are anatomical differences and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.620
 physiological of the digestive system 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.560
 different responses between individuals 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.739
 of the same species current own 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.780
 each species race weight status 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.610
 Nutritional sex function only technique 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.840
 idiosyncrasies the state of health or 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.090
 disease development of tolerance 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.310
 temperament genetic factors and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.380
 physiological variables 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.900
 I want to take what it takes I do not have 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.209
 remedy 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.700
 beckham the bug sister the doctor for 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.069
 to help you with the other points 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.590
 pray my grandfather died because he 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.040
 they applied imberbes team fast doctor 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.129
 I need to know more son you can call me 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.680
 pull doctor as is brother seemed 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.260
 but like that style fate to is not 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.450
 My prestige to the point, what are the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.579
 Factors linked to the drug factors 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.629
 linked to the drug that we must take 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.659
 in account are size of the drug 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:46.849
 purpose drug reactivity design 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:50.220
 of php drugs than the therapeutic dose 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.220
 and administration day increased better 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.920
 or biological tree and that means weight 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.659
 little grasshopper is the bean it 's time 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.040
 to go with the grandfather to ask 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.989
 about other points 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.540
 Grandpa wanted to know if you can 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.889
 help finish my investigation 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.780
 I need to know the factors linked to 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.370
 environment factors linked to the 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.319
 interaction with other drugs and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.329
 factors linked to the vet no 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.600
 I want to cry with two of these six 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.940
 groups 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.820
 light environments are the cover of 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.730
 Drug administration is important 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.920
 Do not take medications at odd hours and 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.470
 the temperature at which you should have a 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.270
 drug for its correct conservation 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.860
 physics and chemistry 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.590
 the factors linked to the interaction 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.420
 with other drugs are their humiliation or 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.130
 addiction kinetic potentialization 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.200
 antagonism this means that there 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.270
 drugs that help improve the effect 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.360
 of others or stabilize their reactions 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.490
 metabolic than others that can get 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.190
 to counteract the effect of others for 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.710
 anti data supplied because I do not have 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.140
 to pay attention to us when the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.320
 pain recovros or ones but not and on the other 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.210
 love holder for pop blues I'm going to 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.160
 finish the investigation right where the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.900
 I started I think the doctor boom is the 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.850
 indicated to explain the factors 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.250
 linked to the veterinarian granma 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.320
 son , I know what you're doing well 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.230
 tell the factors linked to us the 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.240
 exact doctors 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.420
 and these factors are the following 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.780
 error in the diagnosis application of a 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.040
 inadequate treatment and dosage 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.710
 absence of a treatment when not 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.630
 there is therapeutic response is important 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.880
 take into account every aspect of the 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.890
 factors that seem minimal since 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.110
 we put at risk the integrity of 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.690
 patient and it is our duty to take care of it 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.130
 through a good use of drugs 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.700
 thank you doctor this is the end of my 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.700
 investigation
