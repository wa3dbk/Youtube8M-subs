many harmonic situations we don't have

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.899 
many harmonic situations we don't have
time<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.500> get<00:01:15.619> into<00:01:15.829> it<00:01:16.070> that<00:01:16.220> deeply<00:01:16.610> here<00:01:16.790> but

time to get into it that deeply here but

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.749 
time to get into it that deeply here but
I<00:01:16.939> wanted<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.299> present<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:19.280> my

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
ideas about this the the lick is made up

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.460 
ideas about this the the lick is made up
of<00:01:23.409> in<00:01:24.409> this<00:01:24.530> case<00:01:24.770> G<00:01:25.579> minor<00:01:25.759> 7<00:01:25.909> c7<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.570> c7<00:01:27.110> bebop

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
of in this case G minor 7 c7 a c7 bebop

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.590 
of in this case G minor 7 c7 a c7 bebop
scale<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:30.189> three<00:01:31.189> other<00:01:31.549> arpeggios<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.270> G

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
scale and three other arpeggios a G

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.520 
scale and three other arpeggios a G
minor<00:01:32.899> 7<00:01:33.409> arpeggio<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.630> E<00:01:35.630> have<00:01:35.990> diminished

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
minor 7 arpeggio and E have diminished

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.539 
minor 7 arpeggio and E have diminished
arpeggio<00:01:36.979> or<00:01:37.460> minor<00:01:37.759> 7<00:01:38.090> flat<00:01:38.119> 5<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:39.380> up<00:01:40.250> a

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
arpeggio or minor 7 flat 5 and up a

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.170 
arpeggio or minor 7 flat 5 and up a
b-flat<00:01:41.119> major<00:01:41.360> 7<00:01:41.840> arpeggio<00:01:42.520> so<00:01:43.520> what<00:01:44.030> is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
b-flat major 7 arpeggio so what is

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.080 
b-flat major 7 arpeggio so what is
important<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.869> me<00:01:45.049> about<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:46.060> why<00:01:47.060> I

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
important to me about this and why I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.850 
important to me about this and why I
call<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.509> microcosmic<00:01:47.990> bebop<00:01:48.469> line<00:01:48.680> is

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
call it the microcosmic bebop line is

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.580 
call it the microcosmic bebop line is
because<00:01:49.159> from<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.490> small<00:01:50.000> idea<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.229> small

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
because from this small idea the small

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.090 
because from this small idea the small
four<00:01:52.070> bar<00:01:52.430> phrase<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:53.119> can<00:01:53.689> explain<00:01:54.469> to<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.680> a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
four bar phrase I can explain to you a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.020 
four bar phrase I can explain to you a
lot<00:01:55.640> about<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:57.049> bigger<00:01:57.289> picture<00:01:57.409> of<00:01:57.799> how<00:01:58.030> to

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
lot about the bigger picture of how to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.620 
lot about the bigger picture of how to
put<00:01:59.360> together<00:01:59.450> jazz<00:01:59.899> lines<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.240> how<00:02:02.240> chord

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
put together jazz lines and how chord

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.120 
put together jazz lines and how chord
substitutions<00:02:02.750> work<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:03.649> how<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.799> bebop

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
substitutions work and how the bebop

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.389 
substitutions work and how the bebop
scale<00:02:04.490> works<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.810> line<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.320> G<00:02:06.770> minor<00:02:07.009> 7

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
scale works so the line is G minor 7

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.959 
scale works so the line is G minor 7
arpeggio<00:02:07.880> then<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.899> c7<00:02:09.800> bebop<00:02:10.250> scale

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.630 

so<00:02:13.239> Dominus<00:02:13.780> 7p<00:02:14.200> bump<00:02:14.439> scale<00:02:14.829> from<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.310> third

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so Dominus 7p bump scale from the third

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.910 
so Dominus 7p bump scale from the third
and<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.359> goes<00:02:16.540> down<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:17.739> that's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and it goes down and on and that's

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.809 
and it goes down and on and that's
usually<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:19.079> usage<00:02:20.079> of<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.500> bebop<00:02:20.920> scale<00:02:21.219> it's

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
usually the usage of a bebop scale it's

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.000 
usually the usage of a bebop scale it's
always<00:02:22.060> used<00:02:22.239> in<00:02:22.480> motion<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.620> used<00:02:23.890> to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
always used in motion and it's used to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.429 
always used in motion and it's used to
get<00:02:24.310> from<00:02:24.519> octave<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:25.000> octave<00:02:25.109> it's<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.200> very

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
get from octave to octave it's a very

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.569 
get from octave to octave it's a very
saxophone<00:02:27.129> like<00:02:28.079> idea<00:02:29.079> so<00:02:29.920> when<00:02:30.099> I<00:02:30.129> get<00:02:30.340> from

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
saxophone like idea so when I get from

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.369 
saxophone like idea so when I get from
that<00:02:30.730> e<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.799> next<00:02:33.069> e<00:02:33.420> from<00:02:34.420> there<00:02:34.659> I<00:02:34.840> go<00:02:35.140> up

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
that e to the next e from there I go up

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.429 
that e to the next e from there I go up

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
go down my bebop scale one octave okay

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.729
