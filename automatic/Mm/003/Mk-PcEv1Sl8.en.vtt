a little bit but you know I thought the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.720 
a little bit but you know I thought the

offensive well and then I thought the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.730 
offensive well and then I thought the
defense<00:03:08.210> really<00:03:08.510> played<00:03:08.900> well<00:03:09.140> when<00:03:09.440> they<00:03:09.560> had

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
defense really played well when they had

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.190 
defense really played well when they had
to<00:03:09.950> ban<00:03:10.190> some<00:03:10.430> three-and-outs<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.420> some

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200

out it seems like they're shooting into
an<00:04:13.250> ocean<00:04:13.430> but<00:04:14.210> when<00:04:14.360> Roy's<00:04:14.600> Pollard<00:04:14.990> is

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110

grabbing everything like that is that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.710 
grabbing everything like that is that
kind<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.730> how<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.940> feels<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.239> chuck<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.480> ball

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
in his direction definitely there's

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.820

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
going to ask for and for that reason in

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.110 
going to ask for and for that reason in
those<00:04:30.259> situations<00:04:30.470> i<00:04:30.919> throw<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.610> jump<00:04:31.819> ball<00:04:31.849> to
