in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.120 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.060> wrap<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> chain<00:00:03.689> around<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.500> arms<00:00:04.890> and

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
to wrap the chain around the arms and

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.950 
to wrap the chain around the arms and
cannon<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.060> original<00:00:06.509> Black<00:00:06.750> Rock

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
cannon of the original Black Rock

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.620 
cannon of the original Black Rock
Shooter<00:00:07.319> figure<00:00:08.300> these<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
Shooter figure these are the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.030 
Shooter figure these are the
instructions<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.260> come<00:00:10.440> with<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.769> figure

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
instructions that come with the figure

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.480 
instructions that come with the figure
in<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:12.420> last<00:00:12.809> panel<00:00:13.230> they<00:00:13.559> show<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.219> chain

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
in the last panel they show the chain

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.189 
in the last panel they show the chain
going<00:00:14.790> from<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.389> front<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> figure

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
going from the front of the figure

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.040 
going from the front of the figure
through<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> hand<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.340> out<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> back

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
through the hand and out the back

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.390 
through the hand and out the back
without<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.350> around<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.920> outside<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
without it going around the outside of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.450 
without it going around the outside of
the<00:00:20.580> cannon<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.769> but<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:22.890> look<00:00:23.189> at<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the cannon here but if we look at the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.189 
the cannon here but if we look at the
production<00:00:23.880> photographs<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:24.990> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
production photographs on the back of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.589 
production photographs on the back of
the<00:00:25.289> box<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:26.460> looks<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> chain<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.420> going

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
the box it looks like the chain is going

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.009 
the box it looks like the chain is going
around<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> back<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:29.570> didn't<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.750> at<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
around the back and didn't look at the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.780 
around the back and didn't look at the
original<00:00:31.289> illustration<00:00:32.219> that's<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> side

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
original illustration that's on the side

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.120 
original illustration that's on the side
of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> box<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.170> see<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.590> again<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
of the box we can see that again that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.889 
of the box we can see that again that
chains<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.610> around<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> outside<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
chains going around the outside of the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.110 
chains going around the outside of the
cannon<00:00:37.260> before<00:00:37.440> calling<00:00:38.430> back<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> where<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
cannon before calling back to where the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.360 
cannon before calling back to where the
hand<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> we're<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> try

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
hand is so we're actually going to try

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
hand is so we're actually going to try
to<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.850> way<00:00:42.059> instead<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.930> spite<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to do it that way instead of in spite of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840 
to do it that way instead of in spite of
the<00:00:43.350> instructions<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.579> way<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the instructions the way the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.750 
the instructions the way the
instructions<00:00:45.360> say<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.289> easier<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.309> we're

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
instructions say is easier but we're

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.610 
instructions say is easier but we're
going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.809> quote-unquote

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
going to go with the more quote-unquote

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.270 
going to go with the more quote-unquote
authentic<00:00:50.160> look<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.129> I've

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
authentic look this is the one I've

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.250 
authentic look this is the one I've
already<00:00:56.489> done<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
already done so we can see it is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.220 
already done so we can see it is
possible<00:00:59.030> it's<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> matter<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.600> doing<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
possible it's just a matter of doing it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.060 
possible it's just a matter of doing it
in<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.920> take<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:03.379> fidgety<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.769> say<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
in one take it's fidgety to say the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:22.550 
in one take it's fidgety to say the
least<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> doable

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.500 

so<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.100> without<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.270> chain<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:27.510> it's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
so this is it without the chain and it's

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.100 
so this is it without the chain and it's
important<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.110> note<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:30.330> lip<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.840> sleeve

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
important to note the lip and the sleeve

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.990 
important to note the lip and the sleeve
right<00:01:32.140> here<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:33.220> chain<00:01:33.490> will<00:01:33.670> be<00:01:33.700> going

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
right here the chain will be going

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.190 
right here the chain will be going
through<00:01:34.150> this<00:01:34.330> part<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.390> also<00:01:37.690> a

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
through this part and there is also a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440 
through this part and there is also a
small<00:01:38.740> indentation<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.820> hoodie<00:01:40.120> for

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
small indentation in the hoodie for

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.860 
small indentation in the hoodie for
where<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.660> chains<00:01:41.020> going<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.260> go<00:01:41.380> past<00:01:41.650> as<00:01:41.830> well

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.180 

the<00:01:46.870> first<00:01:47.170> step<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:48.130> take<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.490> chain<00:01:48.760> and

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
the first step is to take the chain and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.150 
the first step is to take the chain and
place<00:01:51.190> it<00:01:51.430> between<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.910> hands<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:53.160> then

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
place it between the hands and then

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.980 
place it between the hands and then
drape<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.700> back<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.630> front<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.860> want<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:01.660> want

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
drape it back to front you want you want

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.170 
drape it back to front you want you want
it<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.350> be<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.770> little<00:02:03.250> bit<00:02:03.460> longer<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:04.090> the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
it to be a little bit longer in the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.660 
it to be a little bit longer in the
front<00:02:04.360> than<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.720> back<00:02:04.900> say<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:06.460> way<00:02:06.550> it

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
front than the back say to the way it

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.040 
front than the back say to the way it
touches<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.150> bottom<00:02:07.479> part<00:02:07.660> at<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.900> base

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
touches this bottom part at the base

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.530 
touches this bottom part at the base
here<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.220> back<00:02:09.399> kind<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.760> dangles

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
here and the back kind of dangles

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.560 
here and the back kind of dangles
slightly<00:02:10.869> above<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.550> rest<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.730> base<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
slightly above the rest of the base the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.530 
slightly above the rest of the base the
next<00:02:17.290> thing<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.740> want<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:18.010> do<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:19.120> take<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
next thing you want to do is to take the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.610 
next thing you want to do is to take the
chain<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.810> back<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:21.840> put<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> loop<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.380> a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
chain and back and put a loop in it a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.970 
chain and back and put a loop in it a
loop<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.670> inside<00:02:26.550> around<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.700> arm<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.980> we

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
loop to the inside around the arm and we

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.970 
loop to the inside around the arm and we
take<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> cannon<00:02:31.290> put<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> cannon<00:02:32.770> through

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
take the cannon put the cannon through

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.420 
take the cannon put the cannon through
that<00:02:33.220> loop

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that loop

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.289 
that loop
and<00:02:35.659> on<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.739> hand<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.849> going<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.299> rest<00:02:39.540> on

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
and on to the hand it's going to rest on

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.300 
and on to the hand it's going to rest on
right<00:02:42.299> there<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.819> sits<00:02:45.269> on<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.629> hand<00:02:45.900> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
right there so it sits on the hand and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.670 
right there so it sits on the hand and
we<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.790> chain<00:02:48.060> looping<00:02:48.569> up<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.959> down

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
we have the chain looping up and down

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.599 
we have the chain looping up and down
through<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:52.220> that's<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.370> part<00:02:53.579> that's

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
through and that's the part that's

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.550 
through and that's the part that's
actually<00:02:54.060> dangling<00:02:54.569> where<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.349> hoodie

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
actually dangling where the the hoodie

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.800 
actually dangling where the the hoodie
is<00:02:56.689> now<00:02:57.689> the<00:02:57.750> tricky<00:02:58.170> part<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:59.239> you<00:03:00.239> have<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:00.480> we

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
is now the tricky part is you have to we

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.399 
is now the tricky part is you have to we
start<00:03:01.079> with<00:03:01.230> taking<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.650> front<00:03:01.950> chain

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
start with taking the front chain

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.319 
start with taking the front chain
passing<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.530> underneath<00:03:05.189> that<00:03:05.760> lip<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.209> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
passing it underneath that lip of the

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.809 
passing it underneath that lip of the
sleeve<00:03:07.310> down<00:03:08.310> around<00:03:09.349> below<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.680> crux<00:03:11.129> of<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
sleeve down around below the crux of the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.670 
sleeve down around below the crux of the
cannon<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.019> up<00:03:16.109> into<00:03:16.409> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
cannon and we have to get it up into the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.770 
cannon and we have to get it up into the
hand<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:19.590> actually<00:03:19.769> want<00:03:20.780> specifically

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
hand and we actually want specifically

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.520 
hand and we actually want specifically
want<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.200> get<00:03:22.409> what<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:26.459> was<00:03:26.639> weird<00:03:27.530> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
want to get what the that was weird the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.869 
want to get what the that was weird the
chain<00:03:28.799> kind<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.099> caught<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.519> thumb<00:03:29.730> wall

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
chain kind of caught on the thumb wall

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.449 
chain kind of caught on the thumb wall
on<00:03:30.000> its<00:03:30.120> own<00:03:30.620> well<00:03:31.620> we<00:03:31.799> want<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:31.980> get<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.250> part

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
on its own well we want to get this part

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.009 
on its own well we want to get this part
of<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.730> chain<00:03:32.939> on<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> thumb<00:03:33.389> not<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.810> part

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
of the chain on the thumb not that part

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.369 
of the chain on the thumb not that part
of<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.200> chain<00:03:34.379> so<00:03:34.879> we<00:03:35.879> kind<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.840> place<00:03:37.200> our

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
of the chain so we kind of place our

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.870 
of the chain so we kind of place our
hands<00:03:37.620> here<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.040> hold<00:03:38.310> things<00:03:38.700> where<00:03:39.449> they<00:03:39.540> are

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.770 

like<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.180> doesn't<00:03:45.450> happen<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:47.400> know

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
like so that doesn't happen you know

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.210 
like so that doesn't happen you know
take<00:03:48.780> our<00:03:48.930> thumb<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.320> kind<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.710> push<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
take our thumb and kind of push the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.190 
take our thumb and kind of push the
chain<00:03:50.430> up<00:03:50.550> into<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.880> hand<00:03:51.210> and<00:03:51.450> we<00:03:51.750> want<00:03:51.960> one

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
chain up into the hand and we want one

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.780 
chain up into the hand and we want one
of<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.440> links<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.890> chain<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.220> go<00:03:53.310> over<00:03:53.670> the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
of the links of the chain to go over the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.670 
of the links of the chain to go over the
thumb<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.420> we<00:03:55.380> want<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.860> other<00:03:56.070> link<00:03:57.680> there

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
thumb and we want the other link there

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.670 
thumb and we want the other link there
the<00:03:58.890> next<00:03:59.070> link<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.580> be<00:03:59.700> parallel<00:04:00.600> with<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
the next link to be parallel with the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.230 
the next link to be parallel with the
fingers<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.100> perpendicular<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.030> first

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
fingers like perpendicular to the first

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.740 
fingers like perpendicular to the first
link<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.380> then<00:04:04.590> up<00:04:05.460> against<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.970> fingers<00:04:08.750> let

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
link and then up against the fingers let

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.740 
link and then up against the fingers let
me<00:04:09.840> reposition<00:04:10.080> this

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
me reposition this

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.890 
me reposition this
all<00:04:12.260> right

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
all right

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.800 
all right
Nik<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.739> tricky<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.909> may<00:04:16.090> take<00:04:16.299> more<00:04:16.630> than

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
Nik it is tricky it may take more than

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.879 
Nik it is tricky it may take more than
one<00:04:16.989> try<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.290> get<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:17.650> right

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.809 

okay<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:25.879> we<00:04:26.060> got<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.509> thumb<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:27.770> one<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.729> the

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
okay so we got the thumb in one of the

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.450 
okay so we got the thumb in one of the
links<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.270> we'll<00:04:29.449> use<00:04:29.509> our<00:04:30.159> thumb<00:04:31.159> on<00:04:31.370> our

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
links and we'll use our thumb on our

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.230 
links and we'll use our thumb on our
other<00:04:31.580> hand<00:04:31.789> to<00:04:31.909> kind<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.150> hold<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.449> there<00:04:34.240> well

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
other hand to kind of hold it there well

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.290 
other hand to kind of hold it there well
we<00:04:35.389> kind<00:04:35.599> of<00:04:36.310> want<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.370> we<00:04:37.699> want<00:04:37.879> to<00:04:37.939> increase

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
we kind of want to we want to increase

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.879 
we kind of want to we want to increase
the<00:04:38.360> tension<00:04:38.719> on<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.199> chain<00:04:39.379> all<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.800> way

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
the tension on the chain all the way

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:40.330 
the tension on the chain all the way
around

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
around

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.679 
around
make<00:04:40.490> sure<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.789> cannons<00:04:41.120> in<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.360> correct

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
make sure the cannons in the correct

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.189 
make sure the cannons in the correct
position<00:04:42.169> on<00:04:42.259> the<00:04:42.319> base<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:43.639> kind<00:04:44.150> of<00:04:44.270> work

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
position on the base and kind of work

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.879 
position on the base and kind of work
the<00:04:45.469> chain<00:04:45.710> around<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:47.810> that's<00:04:48.020> it's<00:04:48.710> good

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
the chain around so that's it's good

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.490 
the chain around so that's it's good
amount<00:04:49.099> of<00:04:49.159> tension<00:04:49.400> keeping<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.180> on<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:51.020> hand

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
amount of tension keeping it on the hand

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.550 
amount of tension keeping it on the hand
and<00:04:52.569> hopefully<00:04:53.569> if<00:04:53.689> everything's<00:04:54.169> going

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
and hopefully if everything's going

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.749 
and hopefully if everything's going
right<00:04:56.830> it'll<00:04:57.830> stay<00:04:59.560> it<00:05:00.560> did<00:05:00.770> not<00:05:00.919> stay<00:05:01.279> so

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
right it'll stay it did not stay so

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.659 
right it'll stay it did not stay so
we're<00:05:01.939> gonna<00:05:02.060> have<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.270> give<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.449> another<00:05:02.599> try

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
we're gonna have to give it another try

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:24.360 
we're gonna have to give it another try
as<00:05:04.669> just<00:05:04.969> kind<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.270> way<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.479> is

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370
