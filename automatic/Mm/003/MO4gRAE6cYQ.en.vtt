check<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.200> but<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.410> wouldn't

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:07.080 

Flanigan<00:01:52.920> look<00:01:53.190> at<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.550> looks<00:01:54.030> like

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.770 

get<00:02:08.090> on<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:13.310> see<00:02:13.879> my<00:02:14.120> swash<00:02:14.510> plate

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
get on this now you see my swash plate

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.479 
get on this now you see my swash plate
should<00:02:15.080> I've<00:02:15.760> moved<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.090> linkage<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:21.489> now

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
should I've moved that linkage and now

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.839 
should I've moved that linkage and now
all<00:02:22.700> my<00:02:22.879> endpoints<00:02:23.720> will<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.080> same<00:02:27.849> always

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
all my endpoints will be the same always

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.860 
all my endpoints will be the same always
fix<00:02:29.120> yourself<00:02:29.599> mechanically<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:31.690> think<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.750> lot

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
fix yourself mechanically I think a lot

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.699 
fix yourself mechanically I think a lot
of<00:02:32.900> try<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.230> travel<00:02:33.799> it<00:02:34.099> just<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.840> speeds<00:02:36.379> it

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
of try to travel it just that speeds it

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.860 
of try to travel it just that speeds it
up<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.190> slows<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.819> down<00:02:37.849> but<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.569> still

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
up and slows it down but that still

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.860 
up and slows it down but that still
doesn't<00:02:39.200> stop<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.879> teeter-totter

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:58.030 

you<00:02:45.470> should<00:02:45.830> reapply<00:02:46.190> thanks<00:02:47.030> for<00:02:47.150> watching

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.209 

guess<00:02:58.670> who's<00:02:58.909> back
