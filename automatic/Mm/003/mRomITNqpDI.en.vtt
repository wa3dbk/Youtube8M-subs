my<00:03:40.610> face<00:03:40.820> right<00:03:40.940> now<00:03:41.170> um<00:03:42.170> i<00:03:43.090> really<00:03:44.090> like<00:03:44.630> it

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
my face right now um i really like it

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.040 
my face right now um i really like it
it's<00:03:45.370> not<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.070> oily<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.750> gives<00:03:50.900> me
