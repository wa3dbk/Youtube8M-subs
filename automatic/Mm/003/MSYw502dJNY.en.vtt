00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:05.214
 Hello, I'm John Greene, this Crash Course series. Can we make these books a progressive intervention in the future? 

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.674
 I do not feel like this is a video of Crash Course unless there is a rolling. 

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:16.558
 "Start badge" 

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:19.853
 Today, before we begin our short series of English reading and writing, 

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.774
 We will discuss how and why we read. If you see our chain of world history, 

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:28.946
 You will remember that writing and the ability to read call the signs of civilization. 

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:34.284
 This is a really problematic idea. There are great stories that we have memorized, 

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:39.289
 For example, one of my favorite books is "Mules and Men" by Zora Neal Herston 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.584
 A collection of folkloric stories lived in oral tradition until Neal Herston falsely denied it. 

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.504
 The same can be said about one of my favorite books, Odyssey. 

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:49.633
 But we give writing and reading a privilege because they enable us to communicate directly 

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:54.680
 And transparently with people living in places far removed from us, as they allow us 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.599
 Hear the voices of the dead somewhat. I do not mean to go deeper into the humanities 

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:01.812
 But I want to make it clear: For me, stories are about communication. 

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:05.148
 We did not invent grammar to make your lives miserable in primary school 

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:09.570
 While you are trying to learn what is the character of the shelf, right Marquis? By the way, in this series, 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.241
 I will use the names of my favorite authors instead of the exclamation formulas. 

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.161
 We invented grammar because we without traction characters we would not describe 

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:23.292
 Flying between the clouds or jumping over a pond or "Faulkner" under the stars. 

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:27.462
 Now, for example, if I do my duty and you do your duty 

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:32.259
 You do not think about being my mouth, my tongue, my love for the latest voices 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.596
 Turn into ideas in your minds. This is not what happens! 

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:40.767
 However, if my language becomes confusing, it is spoken in French or "order words used incorrectly" 

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:45.647
 Or I spoke with an incomprehensible blasphemy, I would be a barrier between you and me. 

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.859
 Between you and me? Between me and you. Writing, or at least writing eloquently, 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.364
 Is the result of the desire to use language to exchange ideas and complex experiences between humans, 

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.743
 This is true whether you read Shakespeare's works or poor fiction about vampires. 

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:02.831
 Reading is always an act of passionate reincarnation, and it always portrays for ourselves someone else's place. 

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.917
 So, when Shakespeare uses pentagonal hair 

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:09.505
 Or when Salinger uses a red hunting helmet metaphorically, they do not 

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:12.466
 English teachers have a tool to torture you. But they do 

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:16.803
 At least that they did so on purpose, to make life run through the story in your imagination. 

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:22.059
 But, for your information, asking if they do it deliberately is not a question worth asking! 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:26.563
 Are we still carrying out the "Open Letters" paragraph? 

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:31.318
 Open letter to the author's intention. But first, let's see what's in the secret room today. 

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:36.198
 It is a boat that opposes the current, constantly moving into the past. 

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:40.661
 Dear author intention, as a writer, let me speak frankly: You are not important. 

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.622
 I will not exaggerate as postmodernists did and say "the authors died" 

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:47.793
 Because that will make me feel very nervous. But the author is not that important. 

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:52.381
 Whether the author has intended to use symbolic echo in his book or not is not important, 

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:56.051
 Only important is whether it exists or not because the book is not directed to the author, 

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.971
 It is directed to you. 

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:02.808
 And if we readers can live a richer and better experience with the world 

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:07.479
 By reading a code in the text that the author did not intend to use, we are still the beneficiaries. 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:12.401
 Yes, readers are inevitably a conversation between author and reader, 

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:17.948
 But give yourself some strength in that conversation, readers, go and make a world. 

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:19.575
 With regards, John Green. 

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:24.413
 It is very difficult to make others feel what we feel. 

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:27.416
 You may have experienced such a situation in your life. Suppose my lover cut off her relationship with me, 

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:30.544
 This has actually happened. I want to explain what I feel to my best friends, 

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:36.466
 I say: "It has been completely destroyed, it has broken my heart. 

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.595
 My heart has broken down and turned into a million pieces. " 

00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:43.557
 Well, there are a few things to clarify here. First, I tell you that my heart has not broken. 

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:47.311
 It pumps blood just as it did before separation. 

00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:51.815
 Secondly, I will tell you again that I have not been completely destroyed. 

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:55.652
 If I had been completely destroyed, it would have been so. 

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.907
 I use the exaggeration in my sentence for destruction 

00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:04.119
 And metaphor in my sentence about the broken heart to try to describe what happens in my decision. 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:08.165
 But because I did not use innovative or particularly appealing metaphorical terms, 

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:12.961
 My friend may suffer in an attempt to sympathize with me, and we are talking about my best friends all over the world. 

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:17.466
 Now imagine that you are trying to convey more complex and complex experiences and feelings, 

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:21.637
 Instead of trying to deliver it to your best friends, 

00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:26.058
 You are trying to talk to strangers, some of them may be living very far from you, 

00:04:26.058 --> 00:04:29.436
 And even after your death for many centuries. On top of that, instead of happening during a friendly conversation 

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:33.774
 They read your blank, expressionless texts written on a page. 

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:38.070
 So they can not hear the toning in your voices or see the tears on your cheeks 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.241
 Even if it turns out that this separation will be the most wonderful thing that happened to you in your life. 

00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:44.243
 That is the challenge facing Shakespeare, 

00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:48.413
 It is also the challenge you face whenever you write a text directed to an audience, 

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:52.793
 Whether it's a novel or a good comment on YouTube about the accuracy of our golferian writing. 

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:57.172
 Hush! This is a wonderful golferin writing. So, I will ask you to read a critical reading 

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:02.135
 And consider the text carefully and pay attention to the hidden methods through which the author tries 

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:08.058
 Delivering human experience in full complexity, but I am not asking you to prospect for symbols 

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:12.646
 As if reading is a treasure map you are looking for symbols to get an excellent mark in the classroom. 

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:15.983
 What I ask of you is to critically read you by understanding the language 

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:19.736
 1. You will have a broader understanding of the lives of people other than yourselves, 

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.281
 Which in turn 2 - will help you to be more sympathetic, 

00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:26.535
 In turn 3 - will help you avoid exposure to abandonment in the first place, but more importantly ... 

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:32.583
 4 - critical and insightful reading gives you the linguistic tools necessary to share your stories more accurately. 

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:36.086
 This will help people understand your joys and joys already, but it will also be helpful 

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:40.215
 In many other ways, for example in your attempt to impress the company 

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:44.595
 To adopt your strategy for the fourth quarter or whatever it was that the real job owners do. 

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.388
 Reading closely gives us better tools 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.934
 To explain the profits of companies and the corrupt interests, as we connect with each other. 

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:54.771
 The real reason why the green light in Gatsby's great novel is a wonderful symbol 

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:59.443
 Is that we all know the feeling of standing outside in the evening and staring at the horizon 

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:03.989
 And contemplating a future we may not realize. All of us felt the mixture that slips the bed 

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:08.911
 Of longing and ambition gripping Gatsby while staring at the green light behind the harbor. 

00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:10.829
 Through our correspondence with Gatsby, 

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:16.001
 We learn more about the people around us and about the people who preceded us, as well as about ourselves. 

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.544
 So, over the next few weeks, 

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:23.592
 We will not only read Gatsby but also Romeo and Juliet and some Emily Dickinson poems 

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:27.554
 And the novel "Catcher in the Rye". There are links to download all of these books in the video information below. 

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:30.641
 We will start Bromio and Juliet next week. See you then. 

00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:34.520
 Crash Course produced and directed by Stan Muller. The text supervisor is Meredith Danko. 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.482
 The co-producer is Danica Johnson. The program is my own. 

00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:40.817
 The graphics team is Thought Bubble. If you have any questions about today's video, 

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.778
 You can leave it in the comments section where our expert team will answer. 

00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:48.283
 If you have not done so yet, read Romeo and Juliet, it's a very interesting play, 

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.911
 Though sometimes reminiscent of the "West Side Story". Thank you for watching Crash Course. 

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.497
 As they say in my hometown: "Do not forget to be wonderful."
