 edition of the goals of the week as 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.879
 you can see we have new intro and it's 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.980
 special at the end we will explain why 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.539
 but for the moment we're going with the cap on the 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.639
 number 10 is July for a time with a goal 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.960
 of league master online that the ball is going 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.060
 towards the crisis band that normal or that 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.250
 comes running quickly goes those 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.840
 players and therefore a 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.449
 whiplash to the second post that ends 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.830
 entering very close to the squads 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.750
 there really is not much that is created for 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.939
 play respects dribble simply runs 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.070
 runs runs and shoots the second post 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.110
 let's go from something the number of the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.850
 ranking is from cristÃ³bal without data no 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.470
 we know in what way you have marked it because 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 he has not recorded it as he should 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.560
 so here you have the start of play 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.150
 and his fake towards the band after 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.220
 turn around and now in the center 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.570
 to get to the hotel and running fixos 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.480
 there you have it and how it will surprise us 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.040
 yes friends with a goodbye and read that 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 ends up entering the blocks 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.690
 so well to the second post crossed 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.720
 magnificent this Chilean the truth that is 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.040
 deserves allow in this post 9 some 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.600
 you ask what can be a Chilean 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.520
 to be better then have more play 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.470
 but it really is a goal some number 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.570
 8 also from July comment wraps as 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.310
 master online cake you have the awakening of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.930
 his rival face my head and fixing 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.150
 I would encourage you to let it happen in a way 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.800
 pretty and now stick it with the right 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.500
 with the bad leg above the 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.730
 uncle uncle very very very very far 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.380
 let's see here again the repetition 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.030
 they must be close to them about 37 35 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.920
 meters out there catch the goalie 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.810
 unsuspecting and with the bad leg what 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.270
 just beating for articulating the truth 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 that a pretty nice goal is going to happen 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.110
 to the next goal so numerous and from the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.330
 online access flight and the game is very 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.010
 simple we have here a free-kick is 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.869
 the racist pass applies it pulls the 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.010
 hat and before the pole falls 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.360
 short stick 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.250
 and although the goalkeeper stretches 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.990
 close to interpreting them they do not succeed 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.390
 it only manages to divert not a little 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 so that this ends in colon and in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.369
 heart the number 6 is 97 mx online 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.619
 gay tennis recommended them the center of 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.420
 field second pass third pass for 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.009
 look for the partners because if it is associated 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.340
 let's see what the internal application does 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.710
 the manual volley bout will send the appointment 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.330
 the second suit a goal is enough 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.429
 pretty the play is not there in what is 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.130
 almost to the first touch everything and then 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.990
 leave it and the pass of the Balkan 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.520
 it's pretty good to end up with a 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.250
 annual ancestor with five terms of 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.390
 96 tdt is online and the play starts 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.790
 here in the band is now going to the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.610
 half way forward we have it already 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.500
 they walk jacques and natasha I do not know who 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.090
 cojones is that uncle but perfect if 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.130
 all that was just done in front of 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.470
 diego silva surprises him with that other the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.690
 taco nazo the pizza goes to the ground its 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.250
 rival and the penalty that has not gotten that 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.220
 this goal reaches higher I imagine that it has 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.290
 been that that shot is slightly 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.390
 deflected by the goalkeeper does not just 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.590
 have a very nice building and it's because 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.150
 that sure we're getting high 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.980
 because after this heel of this 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.720
 12 perfect Alix and dodge the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.670
 tarascada de Dodge also thiago 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.400
 silva and from your vehicle two the tread and 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.870
 from the shot to goal is a great goal 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.210
 to see four of santiago alejandro 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.610
 Astrada is the strange language and fix 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.090
 because he pulls out and holds the heel 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.090
 back 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.050
 it is calculated tremendously and ends up entering 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.190
 the half the goal without the goalkeeper 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.690
 can do anything 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.580
 obviously this goal with which many of 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.290
 this guy are clueless the goalkeeper 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.500
 Of course it is inverse not to take away what 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.690
 nice to hit a goal 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.400
 that is not easy to put it and that's why 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.830
 has taken him to position 4 in the post 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 number 3 is the flight before we will see 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.580
 the plays of they can the pdi the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.850
 the person who stings her is given to him by harvard 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.470
 that also stings and makes a pulley 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.820
 very close to the squad enters through its 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.190
 theory that yes after the squad 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.500
 that you have the itch and hit it hard to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.900
 buffon to end up getting close 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.760
 of separated goal number 2 is from Carlos 7 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.020
 This goal is online in the tournament 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.670
 the podiums right now that we've 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.190
 rebooted the water h kendrick think 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.060
 is that he clears 96 with lennon goes and 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.739
 de rossi takes the opportunity to splice a 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.230
 spectacular volley that takes an effect 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.270
 could leave that effect that both goes up and 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.010
 come down from the sky we will see it 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.989
 repeated now as the center 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.209
 clears eren and approaches one of the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.489
 two do not get there we're playing the 26th and 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.780
 the volley of de rossi is odd alaminos 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.860
 in position number one is a goal of 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.570
 sergio fall on your card is in two 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.520
 against two there you have sacks 100 and the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.169
 passenger good vinta la pasa quiere 10 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.790
 but it did not germinate is in plan I suppose 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.919
 is coming and let's see what's here 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.540
 now, how are you going from those two and 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.070
 this is how perfect is the return it 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.420
 goes in the middle of three leaves 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.880
 we grab it and define from there the 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.960
 second stick a chicharrazo that has 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.820
 taken the first place of the player 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.440
 individual with gervinho a player who 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.000
 besides we all know then that it is not the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.000
 typical sitting as a ronaldo Christian 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.290
 messi or any of that style so 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.790
 nothing, I only hope you liked the 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.590
 ranking this week and now I leave you 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.900

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.970

 when I no longer go up and I have 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.770
 prepared this week simply because 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.270
 has risen a ranking with five goals 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.550
 mine then to introduce the series 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.100
 you can see it there and now as soon as 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.990

 nobody demands goals here because they do not 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.440
