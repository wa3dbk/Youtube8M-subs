00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:10.180
 This time I did an adult Christmas date makeup, so I hope to see it until the end 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.180
 Please let's get started 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:23.189
 Ys was the child will continue to use here if or here firmly, such as care of the t zone 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 The it is very shine hard to me to and tightly ask walk to hard to light 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:35.730
 It's a very recommended studio, so it will strike you over the entire white high 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 Next I will use liquid foundation for foundations, such as gold 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.380
 Give me a natural cover 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.940
 Because it is finished to the skin of the semi-mat that has been devoted, it is finished to a very refined skin 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.940
 I will use this 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.970
 Next I will use this concealer Bear and I'm worried 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:04.890
 I will hide the redness etc. after this 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:10.340
 The hybrid's over of rmk is very favorite because it also contains sunscreen effect 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.079
 At the end lightly swallow 5 minutes of mobility face powder 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.149
 I will suppress 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:20.850
 The powder of and the mode show me so beautifully and finished in a soft feeling 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.650
 So I use it recently 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:30.540
 So we will then move to eye makeup First in here 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:36.060
 I will put the color of the Lamely bronze on the entire eyelid. 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.850
 I think that it is not Kana who pulled eye makeup at all with this Kata beautiful here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.540
 I will 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:48.430
 I will put this on my eyelids and spread it as above 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:52.659
 Then the lower eyelids 2/3 can also make the same color with the concealer brush 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:58.390
 Next I will use this ping pout brown 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:02.540
 I put it with my finger this time because there is a fine gold glitter 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:08.259
 I'm heading towards the corners of the eyes to be gradation from the eyes 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:13.540
 I will put the same color in the lower eyelids 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.040
 Then we will use it as a food accounted for here Bordeaux Poi Brown 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.630
 First, towards the inner corner of the eye continue to put in a little darker towards the outer corner of the eye 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.230
 Or 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.680
 I will put to flow 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.960
 After putting it like this 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.550
 Blur with a blending brush with nothing attached 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.020
 I will put out a natural shadow 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:38.740
 Then I will cut it to the same color lower eyelid 1/3 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:44.890
 Next from the Shimmer Brick child bar diamond palette 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:50.190
 Mix the three colors above and mix them with the brush you used earlier 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:53.880
 That beautiful champagne gold looks like this will be a jass at once 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:59.480
 I didn't want to argue so much this time 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.960
 At first we will fill the mucous membrane firmly with gel liner 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.130
 Brown only kid eyeliner 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.500
 So as to flow from the eyes of the middle et al strange 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.390
 I will put in the bottom of the eyes a little thicker 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.310
 To go 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.400
 Apply a purple- like silver pencil eyeliner to the eyelids to get a white eye 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.330
 I will show you 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:26.440
 And I will make the eyelashes curl from the base firmly in the burer 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:31.150
 I will finish with only mascara this time without using the end of the month 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:37.030
 I really like this avance 's mascara recently 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.620
 The length also volume also like to say Do not come down rear curling really come out well recently 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.780
 I use 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.750
 Here 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.750
 Both will continue to paint with plenty of up and down from the object 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.170
 Then it is the completion of eye makeup in such a feeling 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:02.990
 I will write with a pencil for eyebrows on the moon 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:06.890
 I will continue to blur with a brush if I write firmly for 4 seconds with a pencil 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:12.470
 And I think they will use the things of this time Hey Billy 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:18.730
 The tip is round and it is very easy to use here and I like it quite 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:24.640
 We will Trimmed painted with the feeling that say go paying is along the flow received on eyebrows 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.520
 Pose Seno is inserted from the spot of the eye 's most depressed eye towards the eyebrows and it blooms. 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.379
 Will burn 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.860
 And the highlights are more gorgeous with gold glitter 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.860
 I will go 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:47.659
 Next, cheeks will use their matte makeup and so on 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.819
 I wanted to finish it maturely , but I wanted to look like a girl, so it's reddish 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:53.529
 I chose pink and tried 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:05:00.340
 I will put it in a portrait to feel the end and soft 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:05:05.080
 And we will continue to softer feel Honwari will be put to eyebrows the same teak 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:08.800
 And finally the lip is a Christmas make-up. 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.800
 This time I will use the red lip of why 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:18.400
 The current trend is the lip contour 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:20.330
 Since it does not take a fluffy so much contour or say that over Otani scum trends First lips 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.700
 Put it on the pom-pom 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:33.200
 I let it touch with my finger and repeat it several times to adjust the color tone 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:38.870
 Click here if just a little gloss is wearing Finally, the gross so would lose the root 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:43.490
 A little wisdom and it's finished, how are you feeling like this- Christmas date makeup completed 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:47.200
 Thank you for watching until the end of the day I will meet again at the next cup
