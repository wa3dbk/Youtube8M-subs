00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
think that the GMP is overpowered mmm

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.670 
think that the GMP is overpowered mmm
for<00:01:13.390> example<00:01:13.930> if<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:14.470> are<00:01:15.420> playing<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:17.380> I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
for example if you are playing and I

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.770 
for example if you are playing and I
don't<00:01:17.860> know<00:01:17.950> searching<00:01:18.820> destroy<00:01:19.060> or<00:01:19.270> hardcore

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
don't know searching destroy or hardcore

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.710 
don't know searching destroy or hardcore
Search<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.200> Destroy<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:21.520> know<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:22.240> you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
Search and Destroy and I know that you

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.610 
Search and Destroy and I know that you
can<00:01:22.960> kill<00:01:23.320> pretty<00:01:23.710> easy<00:01:23.950> someone<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:25.930> UMP

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
can kill pretty easy someone with a UMP

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.600 
can kill pretty easy someone with a UMP
45<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.260> guess<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:30.159> it's<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.580> little

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
45 and but I guess that it's a little

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
45 and but I guess that it's a little
bit<00:01:31.299> hard<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.380> use<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.190> mp4<00:01:33.580> if<00:01:33.940> I've<00:01:34.090> as

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
bit hard to use it you mp4 if I've as

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.190 
bit hard to use it you mp4 if I've as
other<00:01:35.290> weapons<00:01:36.220> like<00:01:36.460> on<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:37.240> don't<00:01:37.299> know<00:01:37.479> each

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
other weapons like on I don't know each

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.010 
other weapons like on I don't know each
year<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.729> example<00:01:40.210> it's<00:01:40.479> because<00:01:40.659> they

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
year for example it's because they

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.840 
year for example it's because they
