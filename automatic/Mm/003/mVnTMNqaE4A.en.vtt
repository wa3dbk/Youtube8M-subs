00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
I've portable and you'll notice unlike

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.779 
I've portable and you'll notice unlike
the<00:01:11.399> other<00:01:11.580> two<00:01:11.940> cereals<00:01:12.780> we've<00:01:12.929> done<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.319> far

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
the other two cereals we've done so far

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.050 
the other two cereals we've done so far
the<00:01:14.789> cereal<00:01:15.420> pieces<00:01:15.630> come<00:01:16.050> in<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.410> colors

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
the cereal pieces come in two colors

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.100 
the cereal pieces come in two colors
there's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.330> plain<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.740> red<00:01:20.780> perhaps<00:01:21.780> that's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
there's a plain and a red perhaps that's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.900 
there's a plain and a red perhaps that's
because<00:01:22.170> cherry<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> pretty<00:01:23.250> overwhelming

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
because cherry is a pretty overwhelming

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.180 
because cherry is a pretty overwhelming
flavor<00:01:24.349> so<00:01:25.349> we<00:01:25.440> got<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.649> balance<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> out

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
flavor so we got to balance that out

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.779 
flavor so we got to balance that out
with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.550> vanilla<00:01:27.740> or<00:01:28.740> maybe<00:01:29.160> I'm<00:01:29.399> just

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
with a little vanilla or maybe I'm just

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.070 
with a little vanilla or maybe I'm just
talking<00:01:30.149> out<00:01:30.209> my<00:01:30.270> ass<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.869> looks<00:01:33.869> like

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
purple yellow and pink marshmallows
which<00:01:38.160> make<00:01:38.459> us<00:01:38.580> not<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.819> lick<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> sense<00:01:39.390> given

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.100 
which make us not a lick of sense given
the<00:01:39.810> context<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.880> maybe<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> makes<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.840> lick<00:01:42.989> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the context but maybe it makes a lick of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.050 
the context but maybe it makes a lick of
sense<00:01:43.259> given<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.950> actual<00:01:44.190> licking<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.880> the

cherry<00:02:36.730> flavor<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.270> not<00:02:37.300> too<00:02:37.870> cherry<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:39.060> think

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
cherry flavor but not too cherry I think

the<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.570> duality<00:02:41.170> here<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.270> vanilla

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
the the duality here of the the vanilla

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.850 
the the duality here of the the vanilla
and<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.160> cherry<00:02:45.160> pieces<00:02:46.320> really<00:02:47.320> balances

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
and the cherry pieces really balances

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.920 
and the cherry pieces really balances
out<00:02:48.040> cherries<00:02:48.550> usually<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> strong<00:02:49.300> flavor<00:02:49.690> if

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
most of the flavors confined to the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.570 
most of the flavors confined to the
cereal<00:03:40.720> itself<00:03:41.080> which<00:03:41.830> is<00:03:41.950> pretty<00:03:42.130> amazing

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
cereal itself which is pretty amazing

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.160 
cereal itself which is pretty amazing
considering<00:03:42.910> Count<00:03:43.209> Chocula<00:03:43.390> kind<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:43.990> failed

there and Boo Berry never even had the
flavor<00:03:51.360> yeah<00:03:52.360> that's<00:03:52.480> an<00:03:52.540> interesting<00:03:52.630> mixed

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
flavor yeah that's an interesting mixed

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.070 
flavor yeah that's an interesting mixed
I<00:03:53.290> mean<00:03:53.440> I've<00:03:53.890> got<00:03:54.100> orange<00:03:54.370> pink<00:03:55.060> purple<00:03:55.330> and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080

lick of sense given the the theme here
I'm<00:04:00.670> beginning<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.209> think<00:04:01.300> that<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
I'm beginning to think that the the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.740 
I'm beginning to think that the the
white<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.620> red<00:04:02.650> Marsha

in part man sharing part vanilla it's

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.140 
in part man sharing part vanilla it's
weird<00:04:14.020> this<00:04:14.440> is<00:04:14.500> really<00:04:15.280> really<00:04:15.520> good<00:04:15.880> it's

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.249 
haven't been seen for for a decade or
more<00:04:43.009> but<00:04:43.910> this<00:04:44.030> is<00:04:44.090> really<00:04:44.419> great<00:04:44.720> this<00:04:45.050> is

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
more but this is really great this is

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.960 
more but this is really great this is
the<00:04:45.380> better<00:04:45.590> flavor<00:04:45.949> I<00:04:46.310> think<00:04:46.759> this<00:04:46.849> little

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
the better flavor I think this little

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.189 
the better flavor I think this little
piece<00:04:47.180> here<00:04:47.419> which<00:04:47.599> you<00:04:47.690> probably<00:04:47.840> can't<00:04:48.139> see

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
piece here which you probably can't see

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.719 
piece here which you probably can't see
but<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.560> has<00:04:48.710> Mane's<00:04:48.919> in<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.220> like<00:04:49.310> it's<00:04:49.490> bloody

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
but it has Mane's in it like it's bloody

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.580 
but it has Mane's in it like it's bloody
and<00:04:49.940> maybe<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.509> real<00:04:50.660> monster<00:04:51.080> here<00:04:51.110> is<00:04:51.380> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
and maybe the real monster here is the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.820 
and maybe the real monster here is the
the<00:04:51.830> corporate<00:04:52.539> serial<00:04:53.539> ugly<00:04:53.930> Archie<00:04:54.229> I'm

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
the corporate serial ugly Archie I'm

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.510 
the corporate serial ugly Archie I'm
pretty<00:04:55.099> sure<00:04:55.190> it's<00:04:55.310> an<00:04:55.370> unlucky<00:04:56.080> oligarchy

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
pretty sure it's an unlucky oligarchy

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.650 
pretty sure it's an unlucky oligarchy
oligarchy<00:04:58.520> but<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.210> know<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.389> moment<00:04:59.599> they

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
oligarchy but you know the moment they

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.730 
oligarchy but you know the moment they
give<00:04:59.780> us<00:04:59.870> something<00:05:00.050> with<00:05:00.259> just<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.650> right

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
give us something with just the right

flavor<00:05:01.099> like<00:05:01.430> this<00:05:01.819> or<00:05:02.740> OJ's<00:05:03.740> cereal<00:05:04.190> really

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
flavor like this or OJ's cereal really

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.409 
flavor like this or OJ's cereal really
could<00:05:05.229> they<00:05:06.229> take<00:05:06.380> it<00:05:06.530> off<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.740> market<00:05:07.419> and

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
could they take it off the market and

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.020 
could they take it off the market and
and<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:09.139> know<00:05:09.199> give<00:05:09.410> us<00:05:09.530> more<00:05:09.680> bland<00:05:10.099> crap<00:05:10.729> I
