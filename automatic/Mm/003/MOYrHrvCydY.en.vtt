00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey guys it's Dallas when X is 5 soft

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.619 
hey guys it's Dallas when X is 5 soft
monitor<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:02.790> today<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.389> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.540> show

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
monitor and today we're going to show

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.880 
monitor and today we're going to show
you<00:00:03.810> how<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.080> might<00:00:04.290> be<00:00:04.319> able<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.680> get<00:00:04.859> a

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
you how you might be able to get a

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.889 
you how you might be able to get a
little<00:00:05.190> extra<00:00:05.430> sleep<00:00:05.700> by<00:00:06.330> installing<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
little extra sleep by installing a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.860 
little extra sleep by installing a
simple<00:00:07.200> app<00:00:07.379> on<00:00:07.649> your<00:00:08.040> rooted<00:00:08.340> nexus<00:00:08.490> 5<00:00:08.970> now

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
simple app on your rooted nexus 5 now

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.900 
simple app on your rooted nexus 5 now
the<00:00:09.929> premise<00:00:10.320> behind<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.769> one<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.700> blue

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the premise behind this one is the blue

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.209 
the premise behind this one is the blue
light<00:00:12.120> disrupt<00:00:12.809> your<00:00:13.110> circadian<00:00:13.500> rhythm<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
light disrupt your circadian rhythm and

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.340 
light disrupt your circadian rhythm and
therefore<00:00:14.790> suppresses<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> secretion<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
therefore suppresses the secretion of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.040 
therefore suppresses the secretion of
melatonin<00:00:16.970> studies<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.090> shown<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.510> effect

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
melatonin studies have shown this effect

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.099 
melatonin studies have shown this effect
is<00:00:19.140> actually<00:00:19.560> true<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.820> LED<00:00:21.480> backlight

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is actually true and the LED backlight

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.429 
is actually true and the LED backlight
on<00:00:22.140> your<00:00:22.410> Nexus<00:00:22.769> 5<00:00:23.039> does<00:00:24.000> tend<00:00:24.420> towards<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
on your Nexus 5 does tend towards the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.859 
on your Nexus 5 does tend towards the
blue<00:00:25.650> end<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> light<00:00:26.460> spectrum<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.750> we

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
blue end of the light spectrum so we

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
blue end of the light spectrum so we
have<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.080> app<00:00:28.320> CF<00:00:28.800> lumen<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.849> actually

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
have this app CF lumen which actually

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.290 
have this app CF lumen which actually
filters<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.439> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> blue<00:00:32.130> during<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
filters out a lot of the blue during the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.990 
filters out a lot of the blue during the
nighttime<00:00:33.510> hours<00:00:33.800> it<00:00:34.800> uses<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.160> location<00:00:35.820> to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
nighttime hours it uses your location to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.690 
nighttime hours it uses your location to
determine<00:00:36.750> when<00:00:37.020> sunset<00:00:37.500> occurs<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.129> then

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
determine when sunset occurs and then

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700 
determine when sunset occurs and then
starts<00:00:39.030> filtering<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.540> blue<00:00:39.870> after<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
starts filtering out blue after that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.459

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.899 
know when the sunset and sunrise occur
where<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.850> are

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.850 

but<00:01:57.909> in<00:01:58.000> order<00:01:58.149> to<00:01:58.270> get<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.600> actually<00:01:59.020> tested

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
but in order to get this actually tested

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.800 
but in order to get this actually tested
out<00:01:59.979> I'll<00:02:00.159> try<00:02:00.700> location<00:02:01.420> where<00:02:01.600> it's

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
out I'll try location where it's

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.620 
out I'll try location where it's
currently<00:02:02.219> nighttime<00:02:03.219> so<00:02:03.909> we<00:02:04.030> can<00:02:04.240> see<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.509> in

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
currently nighttime so we can see it in

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.460 
currently nighttime so we can see it in
effect<00:02:05.310> because<00:02:06.310> during<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.640> daytime<00:02:07.470> this

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
effect because during the daytime this

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.900 
effect because during the daytime this
app<00:02:08.619> actually<00:02:08.830> makes<00:02:09.130> no<00:02:09.340> changes<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.670> pick

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
app actually makes no changes so we pick

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.550 
app actually makes no changes so we pick
over<00:02:13.150> here<00:02:13.300> somewhere<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.720> China<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.140> suppose

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
over here somewhere in China I suppose

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.710 
over here somewhere in China I suppose
and<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:16.030> if<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.330> back<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.290> app<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
and then if we back out of the app and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.990 
and then if we back out of the app and
head<00:02:19.720> back<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.430> you'll<00:02:21.430> notice<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.880> it's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
head back in you'll notice it it's

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.089 
head back in you'll notice it it's
already<00:02:22.300> change<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.200> color<00:02:23.410> filter<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
already change the color filter on the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.280 
already change the color filter on the
on<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.400> screen<00:02:24.760> as<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.510> thinks<00:02:25.599> it's<00:02:25.840> after

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
on the screen as it thinks it's after

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.140 
on the screen as it thinks it's after
sundown<00:02:26.709> we<00:02:27.280> don't<00:02:27.459> need<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.700> blue<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.060> our

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
sundown we don't need the blue in our

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.970 
sundown we don't need the blue in our
screen<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.930> it's<00:02:29.019> taking<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.380> out<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.830> works

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
screen so it's taking that out it works

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.650 
screen so it's taking that out it works
by<00:02:30.190> adding<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.549> grayscale<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.150> converting

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
by adding a grayscale or converting

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.630 
by adding a grayscale or converting
everything<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.140> grayscale<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.340> simply

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
everything to grayscale and then simply

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.240 
everything to grayscale and then simply
adding<00:02:33.970> colors<00:02:34.299> back<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.620> don't<00:02:35.860> get<00:02:36.010> as

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
adding colors back so you don't get as

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.940 
adding colors back so you don't get as
much<00:02:36.459> blue<00:02:36.849> as<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.870> would<00:02:37.959> normally<00:02:38.110> get

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.800 

these<00:02:41.950> other<00:02:42.069> screens<00:02:42.459> everywhere<00:02:42.819> instead

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
these other screens everywhere instead

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.960 
these other screens everywhere instead
of<00:02:43.900> having<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.260> tent<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.980> tends<00:02:45.430> towards<00:02:45.819> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
of having a tent that tends towards the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.120 
of having a tent that tends towards the
blue<00:02:46.180> end<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.630> spectrum<00:02:46.860> they<00:02:47.860> will<00:02:48.010> now

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
blue end of the spectrum they will now

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.640 
blue end of the spectrum they will now
have<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.370> reg<00:02:48.819> perhaps<00:02:49.480> maybe<00:02:49.780> yellowish<00:02:50.319> tint

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
have a reg perhaps maybe yellowish tint

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.680 
have a reg perhaps maybe yellowish tint
but<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.519> all<00:02:51.670> good<00:02:51.910> actually<00:02:52.150> because

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
but this is all good actually because

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.530 
but this is all good actually because
that's<00:02:53.620> exactly<00:02:53.769> what<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.340> need<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:55.180> ensure

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
that's exactly what we need to ensure

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.890 
that's exactly what we need to ensure
that<00:02:55.569> our<00:02:56.970> circadian<00:02:57.970> rhythm<00:02:58.599> is<00:02:58.720> not

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
that our circadian rhythm is not

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.229 
that our circadian rhythm is not
interrupted<00:02:59.230> at<00:02:59.620> night<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.880> course<00:03:00.910> for
