at<00:00:00.210> fitc<00:00:00.989> 2010<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.129> attended<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.909> Libra<00:00:03.360> manado

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
at fitc 2010 I attended a Libra manado

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.410 
at fitc 2010 I attended a Libra manado
session<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.170> multi-touch<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.980> flash<00:00:05.240> in<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
session on multi-touch and flash in the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.680 
session on multi-touch and flash in the
session<00:00:06.750> he<00:00:06.839> showed<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:08.150> multi-touch<00:00:09.150> display

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
session he showed a multi-touch display

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.080 
session he showed a multi-touch display
from<00:00:10.320> 3m<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:10.980> could<00:00:11.160> buy<00:00:11.490> commercially

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
from 3m that you could buy commercially

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.419 
from 3m that you could buy commercially
I<00:00:12.269> took<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.960> out<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.320> picked<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
I took that out and picked it up and

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.829 
I took that out and picked it up and
since<00:00:14.940> then<00:00:15.089> I'm<00:00:15.210> messing<00:00:15.570> around<00:00:15.660> with

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
since then I'm messing around with

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.609 
since then I'm messing around with
multi-touch<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.410> flash<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> first<00:00:19.560> thing

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
multi-touch and flash so the first thing

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.260 
multi-touch and flash so the first thing
I<00:00:19.770> started<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.250> multi-touch<00:00:20.730> was

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
I started to do with multi-touch was

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.720 
I started to do with multi-touch was
figure<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.109> raw<00:00:22.289> input<00:00:22.740> modes<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
figure out just the raw input modes so

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.849 
figure out just the raw input modes so
for<00:00:23.970> example<00:00:24.500> detecting<00:00:25.500> multiple<00:00:25.650> points

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
for example detecting multiple points

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.439 
for example detecting multiple points
after<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.310> comfortable<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.210> raw

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
after I got comfortable with the raw

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.930 
after I got comfortable with the raw
input<00:00:30.990> data<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.500> started<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> mess<00:00:32.430> around<00:00:32.579> with

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
input data I started to mess around with

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
input data I started to mess around with
how<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.329> use<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.600> data<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.190> create

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
how we can use that data to create

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250 
how we can use that data to create
different<00:00:36.059> types<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> effects<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.079> for

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
different types of effects so for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.650 
different types of effects so for
example<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.829> case<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.879> only<00:00:38.940> having<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
example in this case not only having the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.720 
example in this case not only having the
input<00:00:39.899> mode<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.320> giving<00:00:40.590> them<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.920> velocity

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
input mode but giving them a velocity

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:54.490 
input mode but giving them a velocity
and<00:00:42.000> boundaries

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.560 

and<00:00:54.590> of<00:00:55.250> course<00:00:55.460> all<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.910> was<00:00:56.090> done<00:00:56.270> fly

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
and of course all this was done fly

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.170 
and of course all this was done fly
brush<00:00:56.840> in<00:00:56.960> mind<00:00:57.170> in<00:00:57.410> terms<00:00:57.470> of<00:00:58.280> how<00:00:58.820> we<00:00:58.880> can<00:00:59.060> use

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
brush in mind in terms of how we can use

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.900 
brush in mind in terms of how we can use
multi-touch<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.900> augment<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.500> existing

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
multi-touch to augment the existing

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:14.620 
multi-touch to augment the existing
motion<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.090> physics<00:01:02.510> controls<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.989> my<00:01:03.110> brush

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.480 

so<00:01:15.259> no<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.530> practical<00:01:16.009> example<00:01:16.430> of

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
so no the practical example of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.429 
so no the practical example of
multi-touch<00:01:16.939> is<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.479> stuff<00:01:17.780> like<00:01:17.810> Microsoft

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
multi-touch is in stuff like Microsoft

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.730 
multi-touch is in stuff like Microsoft
Surface<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.670> case<00:01:19.969> I<00:01:20.210> have<00:01:20.270> just<00:01:20.740> redone

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
Surface in this case I have just redone

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.609 
Surface in this case I have just redone
a<00:01:22.039> version<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.820> photo<00:01:23.630> viewer<00:01:23.930> in<00:01:24.170> this

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
a version of the photo viewer in this

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.410 
a version of the photo viewer in this
case<00:01:24.860> I'm<00:01:25.100> pulling<00:01:25.399> from<00:01:25.520> Flickr<00:01:25.850> based<00:01:26.180> on

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
case I'm pulling from Flickr based on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.139 
case I'm pulling from Flickr based on
just<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.110> keyword<00:01:27.380> search<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:28.460> I'm<00:01:28.789> using<00:01:28.970> the

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
just a keyword search so I'm using the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.910 
just a keyword search so I'm using the
same<00:01:29.360> code<00:01:29.659> is<00:01:29.840> with<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.079> ball<00:01:30.229> demos<00:01:30.619> but

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
same code is with the ball demos but

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.919 
same code is with the ball demos but
just<00:01:31.159> applying<00:01:31.399> it<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.579> photographs<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:32.840> in

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
just applying it to photographs so in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:33.910 
just applying it to photographs so in
this<00:01:32.990> case<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:33.350> can<00:01:33.439> grab<00:01:33.560> multiple

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
this case we can grab multiple

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.950 
this case we can grab multiple
photographs<00:01:34.360> I'm<00:01:35.360> kind<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.659> just<00:01:35.869> moving

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
photographs I'm kind of just moving

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.630 
photographs I'm kind of just moving
around<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.380> screen<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:36.860> sort<00:01:37.159> them<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:37.460> order

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
around the screen and sort them in order

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.740 
around the screen and sort them in order
them<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.060> all<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.270> stuff<00:01:40.569> but<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:41.720> thing

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
them and all that stuff but the thing

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.059 
them and all that stuff but the thing
that's<00:01:42.049> important<00:01:42.439> understand<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.039> that

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
that's important understand is that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.850 
that's important understand is that
flash<00:01:43.490> has<00:01:43.789> two<00:01:44.119> input<00:01:44.569> modes<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:45.020> has<00:01:45.200> raw

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
flash has two input modes it has raw

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.169 
flash has two input modes it has raw
touch<00:01:46.159> data<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:47.810> has<00:01:48.280> gesture<00:01:49.280> input<00:01:49.429> they

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
touch data and it has gesture input they

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.539 
touch data and it has gesture input they
don't<00:01:50.390> work<00:01:50.569> at<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.750> same<00:01:51.049> time<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.189> to

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
don't work at the same time so to

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.429 
don't work at the same time so to
demonstrate<00:01:53.209> that<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:53.869> can<00:01:53.990> see<00:01:54.229> here<00:01:54.409> that

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
demonstrate that you can see here that

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.980 
demonstrate that you can see here that
I've<00:01:54.590> grabbed<00:01:55.039> multiple<00:01:55.549> objects<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.569> I'm

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
I've grabbed multiple objects and I'm

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.520 
I've grabbed multiple objects and I'm
using<00:01:57.170> raw<00:01:57.470> touch<00:01:57.770> data<00:01:58.069> to<00:01:58.700> move<00:01:58.880> them<00:01:59.030> around

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
using raw touch data to move them around

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.809 
using raw touch data to move them around
but<00:02:00.530> if<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:00.740> want<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.950> actually<00:02:01.099> rotate<00:02:01.700> and

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
but if I want to actually rotate and

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.550 
but if I want to actually rotate and
scale<00:02:01.880> those<00:02:02.330> using<00:02:02.599> the<00:02:02.689> built-in<00:02:03.080> gesture

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
scale those using the built-in gesture

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.160 
scale those using the built-in gesture
recognition<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.880> use<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.390> gesture

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
recognition you have to use the gesture

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.259 
recognition you have to use the gesture
input<00:02:06.319> mode<00:02:06.709> so<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:07.369> can<00:02:07.490> toggle<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.970> down

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
input mode so we can toggle that down

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.900 
input mode so we can toggle that down
here<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:08.959> now<00:02:09.530> we<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.190> move<00:02:10.340> an<00:02:10.489> image<00:02:10.700> around

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
here and now we can move an image around

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.300 
here and now we can move an image around
still<00:02:11.269> but<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.750> can't<00:02:12.049> move<00:02:12.260> multiple<00:02:12.709> because

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
still but we can't move multiple because

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.360 
still but we can't move multiple because
we're<00:02:13.459> not<00:02:13.489> responding<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:15.560> multiple<00:02:16.160> touch

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
we're not responding to multiple touch

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.039 
we're not responding to multiple touch
points<00:02:16.400> we're<00:02:16.940> only<00:02:17.090> responding<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.810> one

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
points we're only responding to one

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:24.160 
points we're only responding to one
touch<00:02:18.290> point<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.859> then<00:02:19.569> gestures<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:24.019> can

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
touch point and then gestures you can

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.890 
touch point and then gestures you can
search<00:02:24.350> for<00:02:24.590> another<00:02:24.769> object<00:02:25.069> let's<00:02:25.489> say

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
search for another object let's say

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.850 
search for another object let's say
cookies

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:42.380 

and<00:02:33.060> still<00:02:34.060> being<00:02:34.210> in<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.390> gesture<00:02:34.720> mode

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.920 

you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.110 

switch<00:02:48.930> back<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.290> raw<00:02:49.409> touch<00:02:49.680> data<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.970> can

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
switch back to raw touch data you can

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.869 
switch back to raw touch data you can
see<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:52.110> objects<00:02:52.650> will<00:02:53.010> respond<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.849> same

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
see the objects will respond the same

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.900 
see the objects will respond the same
way<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.329> did<00:02:54.360> before

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
way they did before

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.760 
way they did before
now<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.600> doesn't<00:02:56.840> mean<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.200> can't<00:02:57.530> have

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
now this doesn't mean you can't have

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.560 
now this doesn't mean you can't have
multiple<00:02:58.310> touch<00:02:58.460> points<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:59.000> gestures

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
multiple touch points and gestures

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.360 
multiple touch points and gestures
running<00:02:59.840> at<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.960> same<00:03:00.110> time<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.160> means

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
running at the same time it just means

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.880 
running at the same time it just means
that<00:03:01.490> if<00:03:01.670> you're<00:03:01.790> going<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.210> gestures

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that if you're going to have gestures

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.050 
that if you're going to have gestures
you're<00:03:03.890> going<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.070> have<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.430> respond<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:04.940> them

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
you're going to have to respond to them

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.940 
you're going to have to respond to them
manually<00:03:05.450> with<00:03:05.990> your<00:03:06.170> own<00:03:06.290> classes<00:03:06.800> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
manually with your own classes and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.690 
manually with your own classes and
objects<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.440> that's<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.740> for<00:03:09.950> now<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.550> can

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
objects so that's it for now you can

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.270 
objects so that's it for now you can
