00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
of logic by flow studio now power of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.700 
of logic by flow studio now power of
logic<00:00:29.779> is<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:29.929> game<00:00:30.079> probably<00:00:30.380> haven't<00:00:30.649> heard

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
logic is a game probably haven't heard

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.560 
logic is a game probably haven't heard
of<00:00:30.919> but<00:00:31.399> it<00:00:31.579> is<00:00:31.669> a<00:00:31.699> board<00:00:32.059> game<00:00:32.210> because<00:00:32.449> it's

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
of but it is a board game because it's

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.150 
of but it is a board game because it's
based<00:00:32.780> on<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:32.960> old<00:00:33.140> mastermind<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:33.980> game

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
based on the old mastermind in the game

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.470 
based on the old mastermind in the game
where<00:00:34.579> you're<00:00:34.640> trying<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.879> crack<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.300> code

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
where you're trying to crack the code

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.390 
where you're trying to crack the code
how<00:00:36.409> does<00:00:36.559> it<00:00:36.680> play<00:00:36.800> what's<00:00:37.129> it<00:00:37.250> look<00:00:37.370> like

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
how does it play what's it look like

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.360 
how does it play what's it look like
well<00:00:38.120> let's<00:00:38.329> go<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.600> iPad<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:38.989> find<00:00:39.140> out

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
well let's go to the iPad and find out

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.130 
well let's go to the iPad and find out
here<00:00:40.370> we<00:00:40.519> have<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.730> title<00:00:41.089> screen<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.600> it's

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
here we have the title screen and it's

you<00:00:42.229> see<00:00:42.379> their<00:00:42.530> single<00:00:42.920> play<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.399> play

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
you see their single play to play

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.000 
you see their single play to play
through<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.850> one-foot<00:00:44.510> puzzle<00:00:44.930> or<00:00:45.229> a<00:00:45.290> career

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
through a one-foot puzzle or a career

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.979 
through a one-foot puzzle or a career
play<00:00:46.280> which<00:00:46.550> basically<00:00:46.879> is<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.629> go<00:00:47.780> through

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
play which basically is you go through

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.450 
play which basically is you go through
levels<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.350> get<00:00:48.530> progressively<00:00:49.010> harder<00:00:49.220> as

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
levels to get progressively harder as

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.099 
levels to get progressively harder as
you<00:00:49.489> go<00:00:49.989> we'll<00:00:50.989> do<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> single<00:00:51.559> play<00:00:51.829> right<00:00:52.010> now

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
you go we'll do a single play right now

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.479 
you go we'll do a single play right now
okay<00:00:54.109> you'll<00:00:54.320> see<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.500> timer<00:00:54.769> counting<00:00:55.160> up<00:00:55.309> here

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
okay you'll see a timer counting up here

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.069 
okay you'll see a timer counting up here
and<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.090> basically<00:00:56.269> keeps<00:00:56.660> track<00:00:56.870> of<00:00:56.899> how

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
and that basically keeps track of how

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.020 
and that basically keeps track of how
long<00:00:57.109> it<00:00:57.289> takes<00:00:57.559> me<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.739> solve<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.100> puzzle<00:00:58.429> the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
long it takes me to solve the puzzle the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.910 
long it takes me to solve the puzzle the
longer<00:00:59.390> it<00:00:59.420> takes<00:00:59.539> me<00:00:59.929> to<00:01:00.260> lower<00:01:00.440> my<00:01:00.500> score

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
longer it takes me to lower my score

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.200 
longer it takes me to lower my score
will<00:01:01.010> be<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:01.339> you<00:01:01.429> kind<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.640> want<00:01:01.789> to<00:01:01.879> race

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
will be so you kind of want to race

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.359 
will be so you kind of want to race
against<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.570> clock<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.710> way<00:01:03.829> you<00:01:03.890> crack<00:01:04.160> the

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
against the clock the way you crack the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.790 
against the clock the way you crack the
code<00:01:04.550> or<00:01:04.759> solve<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.750> puzzle<00:01:06.050> is<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.560> drag

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
code or solve the puzzle is you drag

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.830 
code or solve the puzzle is you drag
these<00:01:06.950> colors<00:01:07.280> up<00:01:07.460> into<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.820> four<00:01:08.090> empty

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
these colors up into the four empty

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.380 
these colors up into the four empty
slots<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:10.640> have<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.850> get<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.030> right<00:01:11.179> color

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
slots you have to get the right color

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.749 
slots you have to get the right color
and<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.810> right<00:01:11.960> spot<00:01:12.320> for<00:01:12.350> all<00:01:12.710> four<00:01:13.039> and<00:01:13.280> you

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
and the right spot for all four and you

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.389 
and the right spot for all four and you
win<00:01:13.940> at<00:01:14.179> first<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:14.929> just<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.200> guessing<00:01:15.409> game<00:01:15.590> so

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
win at first is just a guessing game so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.850 
win at first is just a guessing game so
let's<00:01:16.580> say<00:01:16.990> gray<00:01:17.990> yellow<00:01:18.970> orange<00:01:19.970> pink<00:01:20.860> to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
let's say gray yellow orange pink to

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.320 
let's say gray yellow orange pink to
test<00:01:22.100> my<00:01:22.280> theory<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:22.909> drag<00:01:23.119> my<00:01:23.270> finger

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
test my theory I just drag my finger

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.770 
test my theory I just drag my finger
cross<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.899> connect<00:01:24.140> them<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:25.030> have<00:01:26.030> two<00:01:26.360> colors

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
cross to connect them I have two colors

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.830 
cross to connect them I have two colors
that<00:01:27.670> are<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.820> right<00:01:29.000> color<00:01:29.270> in<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.689> right

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
that are the right color in the right

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.359 
that are the right color in the right
slot<00:01:30.140> that's<00:01:30.439> what<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.680> green<00:01:30.920> light<00:01:31.130> tells

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
slot that's what the green light tells

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.080 
slot that's what the green light tells
me<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:32.420> second<00:01:32.840> slot<00:01:32.990> here<00:01:33.229> says<00:01:33.470> zero<00:01:34.090> that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
me the second slot here says zero that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.280 
me the second slot here says zero that
would<00:01:35.210> normally<00:01:35.299> tell<00:01:35.600> me<00:01:35.719> how<00:01:35.869> many<00:01:36.049> colors

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
would normally tell me how many colors

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.569 
would normally tell me how many colors
are<00:01:36.619> correct<00:01:36.920> but<00:01:37.070> they're<00:01:37.219> just<00:01:37.399> in<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
are correct but they're just in the

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.649 
are correct but they're just in the
wrong<00:01:37.759> spot<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.049> two<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.380> these<00:01:39.619> are<00:01:39.799> right<00:01:40.659> so

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
wrong spot so two of these are right so

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.179 
wrong spot so two of these are right so
now<00:01:41.780> i<00:01:41.810> have<00:01:41.930> just<00:01:42.170> say<00:01:42.350> okay<00:01:42.710> which<00:01:42.920> two<00:01:43.159> are

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
now i have just say okay which two are

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:52.020 
now i have just say okay which two are
they<00:01:43.490> let's<00:01:43.759> try<00:01:44.290> grey<00:01:45.670> yellow<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.670> let's<00:01:49.670> try

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
they let's try grey yellow and let's try

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.819 
they let's try grey yellow and let's try
red<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.210> purple<00:01:53.590> Craig<00:01:54.590> across<00:01:56.079> okay<00:01:57.079> two<00:01:57.680> are

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
red and purple Craig across okay two are

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.499 
red and purple Craig across okay two are
still<00:01:58.039> on<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.310> right<00:01:58.460> doesn't<00:01:59.000> necessarily

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
still on the right doesn't necessarily

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.899 
still on the right doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.930> gray<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.439> yellow<00:02:00.880> but<00:02:01.880> I

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
mean this the gray in the yellow but I

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.959 
mean this the gray in the yellow but I

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
can test that theory out by going gray

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.270 
can test that theory out by going gray

only<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.840> spot<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:13.319> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
only one is in the right spot now and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.540 
only one is in the right spot now and
one<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> wrong<00:02:14.160> spot<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.780> means

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
one is in the wrong spot so that means

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.180 
one is in the wrong spot so that means
that<00:02:17.550> one<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.850> these<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.360> right<00:02:18.540> here<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.050> one

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
that one of these is right here and one

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.120 
that one of these is right here and one
of<00:02:20.190> these<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.370> right<00:02:20.700> down<00:02:20.910> here<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:23.010> have

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
of these is right down here and I have

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.400 
of these is right down here and I have
to<00:02:23.220> keep<00:02:23.430> using<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:23.910> these<00:02:24.600> puzzle<00:02:25.080> solving

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
so now I'm going to go back and look at

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.470 
so now I'm going to go back and look at
this<00:02:31.650> puzzle<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.580> decided<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.000> hopefully

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
this puzzle and I decided that hopefully

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.210 
this puzzle and I decided that hopefully
the<00:02:33.600> yellow<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.170> red<00:02:34.290> were<00:02:34.620> correct<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
the yellow and the red were correct and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.820 
the yellow and the red were correct and
that's<00:02:35.340> why<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.580> had<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.730> right<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:36.420> ah<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's why I had to right there ah the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.860 
that's why I had to right there ah the
yellow<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> red<00:02:41.520> are<00:02:41.670> correct<00:02:42.030> put<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
yellow on the red are correct put the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.259 
yellow on the red are correct put the
blue<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.290> orange<00:02:43.470> or<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.790> now<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> can

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
blue and the orange or not so now I can

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.910 
blue and the orange or not so now I can
just<00:02:45.450> keep<00:02:45.690> repeating<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.200> yellow<00:02:46.440> up<00:02:46.650> here

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
just keep repeating the yellow up here

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.330 
just keep repeating the yellow up here
the<00:02:47.820> red<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.269> here<00:02:48.709> why<00:02:49.709> not<00:02:49.890> let's<00:02:50.070> flip

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the red right here why not let's flip

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.270 
the red right here why not let's flip
the<00:02:50.519> blue<00:02:50.760> over<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.920> play<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.980> green

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the blue over here and play a green

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.930 
the blue over here and play a green
there<00:02:58.069> note<00:02:59.069> that<00:02:59.280> didn't<00:02:59.550> work<00:02:59.640> for<00:02:59.700> me

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
there note that didn't work for me

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
there note that didn't work for me

there's no green and no blue and the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.120 
there's no green and no blue and the
puzzles<00:03:02.069> what<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.489> telling<00:03:02.670> me<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:05.040> know

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
puzzles what this is telling me you know

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.920 
puzzles what this is telling me you know
looking<00:03:05.370> at<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> colors<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.060> I've<00:03:06.239> used<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
looking at the colors that I've used and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.750 
looking at the colors that I've used and
the<00:03:07.080> clues<00:03:07.260> that's<00:03:07.500> given<00:03:07.769> me<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.580> appears

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the clues that's given me it appears

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.650 
the clues that's given me it appears
that<00:03:09.060> there<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.600> no<00:03:10.230> gray<00:03:11.540> doesn't<00:03:12.540> think

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
that there is no gray doesn't think

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.410 
that there is no gray doesn't think
there's<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.900> purple<00:03:13.370> because<00:03:14.370> again<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:15.269> would

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
there's a purple because again it would

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.789 
there's a purple because again it would
say<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.840> there<00:03:16.019> was<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> right<00:03:16.380> color<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
say that there was a right color in the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.560 
say that there was a right color in the
wrong<00:03:16.920> spot<00:03:17.190> if<00:03:17.340> there<00:03:17.640> was<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> purple<00:03:18.150> or<00:03:18.239> gray

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
wrong spot if there was a purple or gray

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.479 
wrong spot if there was a purple or gray
so<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.079> think<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.620> actually<00:03:19.829> another<00:03:20.130> yellow

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
so I think it's actually another yellow

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.580 
so I think it's actually another yellow
and<00:03:20.700> red<00:03:20.850> somewhere<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.329> here<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.260> we'll<00:03:22.350> try

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and red somewhere in here so we'll try

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.960 
and red somewhere in here so we'll try
yellow<00:03:23.130> yellow<00:03:24.110> red<00:03:25.110> red<00:03:25.410> ah<00:03:28.730> we're<00:03:29.730> getting

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
yellow yellow red red ah we're getting

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:38.440 
yellow yellow red red ah we're getting
warmer<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> we're<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.480> go<00:03:36.510> yellow<00:03:37.400> red

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
warmer so we're going to go yellow red

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.640 
warmer so we're going to go yellow red
now<00:03:39.450> maybe<00:03:39.690> actually<00:03:40.140> when<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.320> was<00:03:40.410> down<00:03:40.500> here

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
now maybe actually when I was down here

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.349 
now maybe actually when I was down here
maybe<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:41.040> pink<00:03:41.280> was<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> right<00:03:41.850> spot<00:03:41.910> so

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
maybe that pink was in the right spot so

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.090 
maybe that pink was in the right spot so
you<00:03:42.480> try<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> pink<00:03:43.019> up<00:03:43.200> there<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.980> gonna

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
you try a pink up there and I'm gonna

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.400 
you try a pink up there and I'm gonna
put<00:03:47.280> another<00:03:47.370> red<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:47.880> there<00:03:48.170> because<00:03:49.170> that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
put another red up there because that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.020 
put another red up there because that
would<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:50.100> one<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.609> was<00:03:50.700> out<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.850> place

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
would be the one that was out of place

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.100 
would be the one that was out of place
down<00:03:51.390> below<00:03:53.359> there<00:03:54.359> we<00:03:54.570> go<00:03:54.750> solve<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.350> puzzle

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
down below there we go solve the puzzle

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.770 
down below there we go solve the puzzle
and<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.710> shows<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.160> winning<00:03:58.370> combination

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.230 

took<00:04:05.780> me<00:04:05.900> seven<00:04:06.260> tries<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.860> four<00:04:07.730> minutes<00:04:07.970> 39

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
took me seven tries and four minutes 39

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.730 
took me seven tries and four minutes 39
seconds<00:04:08.720> although<00:04:08.900> not<00:04:09.080> really<00:04:09.380> because<00:04:09.530> I

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
seconds although not really because I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.590 
seconds although not really because I
was<00:04:09.890> pausing<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:10.900> explained<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.910> final

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
was pausing and explained so final

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.090 
was pausing and explained so final
thoughts<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:14.990> power<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.350> logic<00:04:15.710> well<00:04:15.890> I<00:04:15.920> did

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
thoughts and power of logic well I did

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.289 
thoughts and power of logic well I did
learn<00:04:16.220> one<00:04:16.459> thing<00:04:16.489> during<00:04:16.790> this<00:04:16.940> review<00:04:17.269> and

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
learn one thing during this review and

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.180 
learn one thing during this review and
that's<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:18.019> difficult<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.709> do<00:04:19.010> that

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
that's that it is difficult to do that

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.160 
that's that it is difficult to do that
kind<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.430> thinking<00:04:19.700> while<00:04:20.390> talking<00:04:20.720> and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
kind of thinking while talking and

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.780 
kind of thinking while talking and
