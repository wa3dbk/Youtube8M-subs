00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:14.349
 There are several dinosaurs that inhabited La Rioja 120 million years ago 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.019
 the lackluster ones by their judgments and the knowledge of the species that 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.670
 they existed at that time 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.670
 directly by finding your bones and teeth 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.780
 we know that there were bipedal carnivores and herbivores 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.780
 as well as quadruped dinosaurs 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.660
 maybe the most popular and known is the same they are not 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.600
 the one that has been found traces 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 in several localities in La Rioja 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.510
 it came out well known 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 it is the turret century 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.950
 small team no runner that formed little by precarious 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.520
 as it is deduced from the study of his footprints 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.090
 that appear forming parallel traces 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.410
 that move in the same direction 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.740
 efe 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.630
 We know with certainty that this dinosaur asked in La Rioja 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.120
 by the finding of his bones in nigeria uses that are exposed in the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.570
 interpretation Center 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.090
 other dinosaurs known for their bones found in igea 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.540
 Spanish 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.370
 a carnivore specialized in fishing large fish such as sclerosis 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.880
 those he caught using the Mexicans 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 after communicating 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.040
 the anatomical form of marioni was known 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.770
 and their way of life but we do not know the color of their skin 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 speculation that is repeated in the interpretation of all dinosaurs 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.270
 the paleontologists of aranzadi found in igea a part of the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.840
 jaw of this dinosaur we made the determination to head to london 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.949
 al british museum 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.019
 which would not be our surprise when the next day after seeing this 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.649
 searching and find nothing similar 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:19.839
 the subjef of emte partamento of vertebrados of the british museum we 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.829
 teaches the jaw of the vary and singles 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.659
 i see that it is accurate is just a little larger and confirms that 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.779
 what we have a hand is a remainder of marc of variables therefore its 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.279
 second copy 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.900
 at the level of a vial of this dinosaur that is now known and with the aggravating 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.719
 that the first one has not yet described it is to say there is no 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 publication where it appears 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.120
 the igenea locality is located in an area of ​​extraordinary 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.579
 paleontological richness 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.439
 santi carrillo 500 with goiás and where important remains have been discovered 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.729
 bone 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.049
 suppress Riojan dinosaurs 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.479
 also here two new fossil botanical species have been found 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.569
 and a well castedo 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.489
 in its mountains and ravines there are about thirty deposits 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.909
 immunological 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.489
 more spectacular duels those located on the slopes of the tower 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.659
 the most recent works focus on the peladillo era 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:42.259
 in cornago there is a very important arborescent fern deposit 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.929
 and the magnificent wind flora makes its fossil footprints difficult 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.249
 we fly over navalsaz and its interesting deposits 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.199
 and we arrive at valdecevillo 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.540
 Enclave belonging to the town of Enciso well known for its footprints 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.539
 discovered in 1971 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.909
 enciso has a paleontological center 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.219
 and also has the valdecevillo 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:18.699
 the sites of the virgin of the field the slope of andorra and the sine 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:25.550
 in the term of munilla we find the deposits of the channel 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.580
 with a spectacular trail and good don tito of 36 footsteps 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.080
 and that of peña sporting 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.020
 where there is an exceptional trail that preserves the tail mark of the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.020
 dinosaur along with other footprints of various sizes 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.159
 near gea in the houses belonging to cervera del río alhama, the 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.229
 outcrop of bucket for sherry 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.169
 In addition to the tracks of Ixil or photo we find very interesting traces of 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.349
 other carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs like this one that matched with 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.749
 well I think that the births of dinosaur footprints of the Rioja are 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.849
 the most for its significant importance of the European register 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.039
 both the fund this part and worldwide which offers
