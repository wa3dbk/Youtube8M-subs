00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:33.640

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.970
 little salt 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.800
 first let's make the machine the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.740
 We put in the pot obviously with 2 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.330
 cups of water and let it boil 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.860
 approximately 20 minutes until 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.110
 that is as we show it in the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.730
 screen then we do a mix with 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.440
 all other ingredients and their 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.840
 we put in a principle so that 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.610
 super fast eggs hit the balkans 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.370

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.730

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.730
 the syrup 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.400
