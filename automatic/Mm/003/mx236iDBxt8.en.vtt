00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.480
 greet you dear friends in touch 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.780
 Michael treble in this mini course we 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 we design your kitchen from scratch for 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.910
 example, I decided to take my kitchen which 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040
 I designed for my one-room 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.860
 apartments 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:27.990
 here she is this kitchen well here sorry for 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.770
 poor quality photo apparently filmed on 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.730
 digital camera 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.749
 but I think you forgive me for that 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:41.089
 principle here and so everything is clear yes here 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:46.710
 such a simple kitchen is small 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:51.359
 only 2330 millimeters wide well 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 here the principle is room 2,400 well i did 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.589
 such a size because here was 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.129
 what that pipe, I can not remember why 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:05.909
 I am such a size so they I live she 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.960
 quite simply without any angles without 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.020
 any crooked ruler but the same time 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:19.799
 so elegant and the period on the eye well 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 for a start, it will suit us so even 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.229
 if you are new and nothing in it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.439
 understand then after passing this 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.539
 course you can easily 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.600
 create such unpretentious kitchen and 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.740
 learn all the subtleties and nuances that are up to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.170
 this was for you 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.539
 riddle and also I recommend to go 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.100
 this mini course 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:52.109
 an experienced master maybe you something 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.049
 pick up from this course a new meal or 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:58.170
 the crypt of the skills that are already 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.289
 you have no principle always doing this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.560
 even if I know something about a course 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:08.250
 I was reading or reading a book there 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.009
 there the film watched something else I 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.830
 happy if i like it i can 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.780
 some 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.270
 pass there learn to read and this 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.940
 even better so I advise you too 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:30.220
 do it so what else would say in 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.870
 this introductory course yes and before 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.510
 As we begin to practice 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.420
 Me download here the presentation I had 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.630
 created specifically to us 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.090
 it was easier to pass this course is such 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.030
 instructional presentation that is here 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.240
 tour informe you used before 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.910
 its cuisine here which we Sizes 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.890
 we will create this kitchen 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.790
 so we download it under the video I tell you 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:09.090
 I will lay out the link and download source codes and 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:13.470
 We will work in principle, everything 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.470
 see you in the next lesson
