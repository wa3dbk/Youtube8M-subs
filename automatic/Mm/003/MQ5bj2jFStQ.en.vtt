because you going to go through it a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
because you going to go through it a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
make sure you keep it in the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
make sure you keep it in the
refrigerator<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.369> doesn't<00:01:32.729> take<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> go

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
refrigerator so that doesn't take and go

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.630 
refrigerator so that doesn't take and go
off<00:01:33.270> driving<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.079> doesn't<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.159> an<00:01:35.369> awful

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
off driving with doesn't have an awful

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.550 
off driving with doesn't have an awful
lot<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.759> alcohol<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.470> going

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
lot of alcohol in it so that's not going

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
lot of alcohol in it so that's not going
to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.680> acting<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.159> preservative<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.750> is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to be acting as a preservative and it is

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.390 
to be acting as a preservative and it is
a<00:01:39.900> wine<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.619> therefore<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> take

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a wine and therefore it's going to take

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.359 
a wine and therefore it's going to take
and<00:01:41.549> go<00:01:41.640> bad<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.720> quickly<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> real<00:01:44.070> wine

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and go bad not as quickly as a real wine

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
and go bad not as quickly as a real wine
would<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.360> far<00:01:45.659> quicker<00:01:45.990> than<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> spirit

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
would but far quicker than a spirit

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.319 
would but far quicker than a spirit
would<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:47.790> good<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> keep<00:01:48.149> that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
would and so it's very good to keep that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.460 
would and so it's very good to keep that
in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.509> refrigerator<00:01:49.049> whenever<00:01:49.259> possible

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in the refrigerator whenever possible

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.080 
dashes like that what I'm going to do
instead<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.860> hopefully<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> steady<00:02:41.970> hand

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
instead is hopefully with a steady hand

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.990 
instead is hopefully with a steady hand
and<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.989> spoon<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.500> fairly<00:02:44.250> small<00:02:44.520> bowl<00:02:44.820> on

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
and a spoon of the fairly small bowl on

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.260 
and a spoon of the fairly small bowl on
it<00:02:45.860> okay<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.190> about<00:02:47.459> two<00:02:47.670> dashes<00:02:47.880> that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
it okay that was about two dashes that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.910 
it okay that was about two dashes that
spilt<00:02:48.630> over<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.290> hands<00:02:49.500> isn't<00:02:49.650> quite<00:02:49.890> that

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
spilt over so my hands isn't quite that

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.620 
spilt over so my hands isn't quite that
steady<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:52.130> dump<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> remainder<00:02:53.700> now

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
steady so now we dump the remainder now

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.400 
steady so now we dump the remainder now
we<00:02:54.690> had<00:02:54.840> our<00:02:54.959> ice<00:02:59.840> now<00:03:00.840> again<00:03:01.110> we're<00:03:01.230> going<00:03:01.320> to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
we had our ice now again we're going to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.720 
we had our ice now again we're going to
differ<00:03:01.680> from<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.070> original<00:03:02.100> recipe<00:03:02.640> because

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
differ from the original recipe because

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.520 
differ from the original recipe because
he<00:03:02.910> called<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.269> shake<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:04.410> obviously

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
he called to shake it but obviously

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.350 
he called to shake it but obviously
shaking<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.280> drink<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.060> wouldn't<00:03:06.239> be

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
shaking a drink like this wouldn't be

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.290 
shaking a drink like this wouldn't be
appropriate<00:03:06.510> because<00:03:06.840> we'd<00:03:07.200> cloud<00:03:07.440> up

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
appropriate because we'd cloud up

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.520 
appropriate because we'd cloud up
especially<00:03:09.300> if<00:03:09.690> you're<00:03:09.810> using<00:03:09.959> equal<00:03:10.260> parts

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
especially if you're using equal parts

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.990 
especially if you're using equal parts
of<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.709> ingredients<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> creme<00:03:11.910> de

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
of all ingredients so the creme de

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.150 
of all ingredients so the creme de
violette<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.930> dry<00:03:13.080> vermouth<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.980> the

violette and the dry vermouth and the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.770 
violette and the dry vermouth and the
absinthe<00:03:14.610> which<00:03:14.820> would<00:03:15.150> cloud<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.540> quite<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
absinthe which would cloud up quite a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.620 
absinthe which would cloud up quite a
bit<00:03:17.269> very<00:03:18.269> nice<00:03:19.310> purple<00:03:20.310> violet<00:03:21.030> color<00:03:21.360> is

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
bit very nice purple violet color is

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.420 
bit very nice purple violet color is
obviously<00:03:22.290> coming<00:03:22.560> from<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.860> cream<00:03:23.070> bulet

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
obviously coming from the cream bulet

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:32.330 
obviously coming from the cream bulet
which<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.150> very<00:03:24.360> nice<00:03:24.750> way<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.019> do<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:31.250> now<00:03:32.250> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
which is very nice way to do it now the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.000 
which is very nice way to do it now the
there<00:03:33.000> was<00:03:33.120> no<00:03:33.269> garnish<00:03:33.780> called<00:03:34.260> for<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.860> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
there was no garnish called for in the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.310 
there was no garnish called for in the
drink<00:03:35.220> originally<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.540> could<00:03:36.780> try<00:03:36.989> think<00:03:37.230> a

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
drink originally you could try think a

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.229 
drink originally you could try think a
lemon<00:03:38.010> peel<00:03:38.190> would<00:03:38.370> work<00:03:38.489> very<00:03:38.519> well<00:03:38.820> on<00:03:39.000> this

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
lemon peel would work very well on this

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.479 
lemon peel would work very well on this
i<00:03:39.989> wouldn't<00:03:40.530> try<00:03:40.650> things<00:03:40.829> like<00:03:41.040> cherries<00:03:41.370> or

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
i wouldn't try things like cherries or

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.120 
i wouldn't try things like cherries or
olives<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.630> since<00:03:42.810> he<00:03:42.989> didn't<00:03:43.260> call<00:03:43.410> for<00:03:43.769> a

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
olives but since he didn't call for a

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.340
