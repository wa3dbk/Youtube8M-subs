00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
well let's take a brief video to uncover

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.220 
well let's take a brief video to uncover
the<00:00:09.880> question<00:00:10.180> about<00:00:10.330> the<00:00:11.200> Indian<00:00:11.830> systems

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
the question about the Indian systems

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.440 
the question about the Indian systems
human<00:00:14.230> number<00:00:14.410> we<00:00:14.860> covered<00:00:15.549> again<00:00:15.789> burly<00:00:16.240> move

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
human number we covered again burly move

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.359 
human number we covered again burly move
against<00:00:16.810> them's<00:00:16.990> a<00:00:17.080> bitch<00:00:17.289> now<00:00:17.980> what<00:00:18.220> two

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
against them's a bitch now what two

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.480 
against them's a bitch now what two
burly<00:00:18.580> Moe<00:00:19.030> and<00:00:19.300> Mitch<00:00:19.720> have<00:00:19.960> in<00:00:20.080> common<00:00:20.490> well

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
burly Moe and Mitch have in common well

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.359 
burly Moe and Mitch have in common well
they<00:00:22.269> both<00:00:22.599> have<00:00:22.990> their<00:00:23.199> names<00:00:23.439> prefixed<00:00:24.220> as

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
they both have their names prefixed as

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.980 
they both have their names prefixed as
in<00:00:24.730> nimzo-indian<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.890> BOGO<00:00:27.429> -<00:00:27.730> Indian<00:00:28.300> so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
in nimzo-indian and BOGO - Indian so

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.040 
in nimzo-indian and BOGO - Indian so
these<00:00:29.619> Indian<00:00:30.220> systems<00:00:30.669> arise<00:00:31.029> in<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.509> D<00:00:31.689> for

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
these Indian systems arise in the D for

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.980 
these Indian systems arise in the D for
openings<00:00:32.950> so<00:00:33.610> after<00:00:33.910> Knight<00:00:34.090> f6<00:00:34.300> this<00:00:34.840> in

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
openings so after Knight f6 this in

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.080 
openings so after Knight f6 this in
itself<00:00:35.320> as<00:00:35.530> a<00:00:35.560> hyper-model<00:00:36.190> move<00:00:36.430> because

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
itself as a hyper-model move because

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.090 
itself as a hyper-model move because
it's<00:00:37.270> exerting<00:00:37.870> influence<00:00:38.050> i<00:00:38.559> was<00:00:38.710> key

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
it's exerting influence i was key

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.400 
it's exerting influence i was key
central<00:00:39.489> squares<00:00:39.940> it's<00:00:40.570> not<00:00:40.780> occupying<00:00:41.260> the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
central squares it's not occupying the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.430 
central squares it's not occupying the
center<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.520> there's<00:00:43.059> a<00:00:43.210> few<00:00:43.510> major<00:00:43.750> branches

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
center and there's a few major branches

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.560 
center and there's a few major branches
of<00:00:44.590> indian<00:00:45.010> systems<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:46.000> obviously<00:00:46.329> we've<00:00:46.539> got

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
of indian systems so obviously we've got

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.920 
of indian systems so obviously we've got
nimzo-indian<00:00:47.219> which<00:00:48.219> is<00:00:48.370> Knight<00:00:48.640> c3<00:00:48.940> Bishop

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
nimzo-indian which is Knight c3 Bishop

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.979 
nimzo-indian which is Knight c3 Bishop
b4<00:00:50.410> now<00:00:51.129> if<00:00:51.370> white<00:00:51.609> avoids<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.690> nimzo-indian

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
b4 now if white avoids the nimzo-indian

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.920 
b4 now if white avoids the nimzo-indian
and<00:00:53.530> plays<00:00:53.739> Knight<00:00:54.010> f3<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:55.210> most<00:00:55.420> popular

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
and plays Knight f3 the most popular

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.250 
and plays Knight f3 the most popular
move<00:00:56.140> here<00:00:56.559> is<00:00:57.300> b6<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.480> we<00:00:58.570> call<00:00:58.750> this<00:00:58.870> Queen's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
move here is b6 and we call this Queen's

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.650 
move here is b6 and we call this Queen's
Indian<00:00:59.530> territory<00:01:00.219> but<00:01:00.850> there's<00:01:01.090> also<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.390> kind

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
Indian territory but there's also a kind

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.689 
Indian territory but there's also a kind
of<00:01:01.809> weird<00:01:02.230> mixture<00:01:02.679> of<00:01:02.829> Queens<00:01:03.100> engine<00:01:03.519> and

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
of weird mixture of Queens engine and

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.390 
of weird mixture of Queens engine and
Bishop<00:01:04.570> befalls<00:01:05.019> called<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.620> kind<00:01:05.830> of<00:01:05.920> BOGO

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
Bishop befalls called the kind of BOGO

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.760 
Bishop befalls called the kind of BOGO
Indian<00:01:06.990> Territory<00:01:07.990> where<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.350> Bishop

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
Indian Territory where like Bishop

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.190 
Indian Territory where like Bishop
before<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.580> think<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:10.299> is<00:01:10.420> BOGO<00:01:10.780> Indian

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
before I think this is BOGO Indian

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.499 
before I think this is BOGO Indian
territory<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:12.100> these<00:01:12.280> nine<00:01:12.520> prefixes<00:01:13.330> with

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
territory so these nine prefixes with

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.340 
territory so these nine prefixes with
Indian<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.850> know<00:01:15.970> or<00:01:16.240> are<00:01:16.630> often<00:01:17.020> that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
Indian you know or are often that

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.550 
Indian you know or are often that
they're<00:01:17.590> directly<00:01:18.100> linked<00:01:18.640> infused<00:01:19.240> with<00:01:19.780> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
they're directly linked infused with the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.149 
they're directly linked infused with the
reins<00:01:20.799> of<00:01:20.979> hyper-modern<00:01:21.460> players<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.950> have

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
reins of hyper-modern players we have

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.940 
reins of hyper-modern players we have
also<00:01:24.520> like<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.420> growing<00:01:25.689> food<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.140> not<00:01:26.290> hasn't

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
also like the growing food is not hasn't

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.039 
also like the growing food is not hasn't
got<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.100> word<00:01:27.369> Indian<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:28.299> but<00:01:28.930> I<00:01:28.960> think

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
got the word Indian in it but I think

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.910 
got the word Indian in it but I think
it's<00:01:29.439> still<00:01:29.680> classified<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.840> an<00:01:32.560> Indian

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
it's still classified as an Indian

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.980 
it's still classified as an Indian
system<00:01:33.189> but<00:01:34.060> before<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:34.479> check<00:01:34.630> out<00:01:34.869> the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
system but before we check out the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.350 
system but before we check out the
ground<00:01:35.200> for<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.470> king's<00:01:35.710> engine<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:37.210> this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
ground for the king's engine is in this

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.170 
ground for the king's engine is in this
one<00:01:37.540> where<00:01:38.140> white<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:39.220> know<00:01:39.250> allowed<00:01:39.970> to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
one where white is a you know allowed to

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.109 
one where white is a you know allowed to
establish<00:01:40.329> this<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.110> broad<00:01:41.399> center<00:01:42.399> just<00:01:42.970> to

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
establish this this broad center just to

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.060 
establish this this broad center just to
try<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.360> undermine<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.899> later<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.470> Kings<00:01:44.799> -

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
try and undermine that later so Kings -

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.429 
try and undermine that later so Kings -
Indian<00:01:45.549> obviously<00:01:46.210> no<00:01:46.390> prior<00:01:46.689> nine<00:01:46.960> prefix

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
Indian obviously no prior nine prefix

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.090 
Indian obviously no prior nine prefix
there<00:01:47.740> but<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.670> gong<00:01:48.820> field<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.829> where<00:01:50.829> black

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
there but the gong field is where black

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.149 
there but the gong field is where black
plays<00:01:51.399> like<00:01:51.670> d5<00:01:52.329> here<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:53.229> stop<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.710> efore

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
plays like d5 here to stop that efore

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.139 
plays like d5 here to stop that efore
pawn<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.740> apparently<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:57.610> considered<00:01:58.060> an

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
pawn and apparently it's considered an

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.959 
pawn and apparently it's considered an
Indian<00:01:58.420> defense<00:01:58.780> as<00:01:58.990> well<00:01:59.200> but<00:01:59.890> we<00:02:00.549> have<00:02:00.759> also

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
Indian defense as well but we have also

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.639 
Indian defense as well but we have also
simply<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.110> old<00:02:02.380> Indian<00:02:03.039> which<00:02:04.649> defense

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
simply the old Indian which defense

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.290 
simply the old Indian which defense
which<00:02:05.920> i<00:02:06.159> think<00:02:06.219> is<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.240> like<00:02:07.420> d6<00:02:08.190> here

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
which i think is is just like d6 here

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.240 
which i think is is just like d6 here
we'll<00:02:10.300> review<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.690> just<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:11.080> plain<00:02:11.350> 485<00:02:12.070> it's

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
nightmare moved to e4 which which is

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.240 
nightmare moved to e4 which which is

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
games in the Alec on defense but um so

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.240 
games in the Alec on defense but um so
it's<00:04:21.299> got<00:04:21.419> hyper-modern<00:04:21.870> traits<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.830> maybe<00:04:23.070> we

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
it's got hyper-modern traits so maybe we

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.659 
it's got hyper-modern traits so maybe we
can<00:04:23.430> also<00:04:23.550> consider<00:04:24.080> yeah

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
can also consider yeah

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.520

the teachings of Steinitz and tarish we

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.439 
the teachings of Steinitz and tarish we
needed<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.740> contrast<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.610> think<00:04:40.879> and<00:04:41.180> we

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
needed that contrast I think and we

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.749 
needed that contrast I think and we
needed<00:04:41.749> that<00:04:41.870> contrast<00:04:42.379> later<00:04:42.650> when<00:04:42.949> Karpov

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
needed that contrast later when Karpov

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.790 
needed that contrast later when Karpov
became<00:04:44.150> dominant<00:04:44.509> that<00:04:44.719> it's<00:04:44.900> it's<00:04:45.289> great<00:04:45.499> for

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
became dominant that it's it's great for

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.290 
became dominant that it's it's great for
the<00:04:45.919> game<00:04:46.039> that<00:04:46.099> Kasparov<00:04:46.669> came<00:04:46.879> along<00:04:47.120> which

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
the game that Kasparov came along which

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.659 
the game that Kasparov came along which
again<00:04:47.840> we<00:04:48.050> established<00:04:48.499> this<00:04:48.620> dynamic<00:04:49.159> aspect

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
again we established this dynamic aspect

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.450 
again we established this dynamic aspect
of<00:04:49.879> the<00:04:50.479> game<00:04:50.689> so<00:04:51.289> this<00:04:51.439> this<00:04:51.710> hyper<00:04:51.979> modern

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460

kind of you know hyper modernism to me
is<00:04:56.300> like<00:04:56.479> putting<00:04:57.289> our<00:04:57.499> arrogance<00:04:58.009> in<00:04:58.219> check

to cover perhaps next which NIMS I beat
the<00:05:47.659> Kings<00:05:47.930> engine<00:05:48.969> but<00:05:49.969> I<00:05:50.270> think<00:05:50.509> it<00:05:50.629> was<00:05:50.719> the

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:50.899 
the Kings engine but I think it was the

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:54.040 
the Kings engine but I think it was the
Russians<00:05:51.589> which<00:05:51.919> really<00:05:52.310> invigorated<00:05:53.210> things

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
Russians which really invigorated things

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.329 
Russians which really invigorated things
like<00:05:54.199> the<00:05:54.289> Kings<00:05:54.469> engine<00:05:54.740> later<00:05:54.979> in<00:05:55.219> the

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:55.339 
like the Kings engine later in the

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:57.339 
like the Kings engine later in the
forties<00:05:55.759> so<00:05:55.789> people<00:05:56.300> like<00:05:56.419> Bronstein<00:05:57.110> in

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
forties so people like Bronstein in

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.369 
forties so people like Bronstein in
particular<00:05:57.889> and<00:05:58.689> another<00:05:59.689> players<00:05:59.930> like<00:06:00.139> him

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
particular and another players like him

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.639 
particular and another players like him
and<00:06:00.649> they<00:06:01.479> revisited<00:06:02.479> so<00:06:03.110> some<00:06:03.349> of<00:06:03.379> these<00:06:03.500> are

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:03.649
