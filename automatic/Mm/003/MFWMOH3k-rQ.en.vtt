Wednesday May 27th 2009 today I think
our<00:00:14.190> model<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> little<00:00:15.179> more

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
our model is a little more

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.730 
our model is a little more
straightforward<00:00:15.900> than<00:00:16.160> yesterday's<00:00:17.160> volcano

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
straightforward than yesterday's volcano

straightforward than yesterday's volcano
today<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:20.039> doing<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.699> chair<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.830> it<00:00:22.830> uses<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
today we're doing a chair and it uses a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.910 
today we're doing a chair and it uses a
regular<00:00:24.300> piece<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.750> origami<00:00:25.050> paper<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.830> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
regular piece of origami paper but you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.169 
regular piece of origami paper but you
do<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> make<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.820> cut<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:28.340> gather<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.640> your

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
do have to make a cut so gather up your

of paper with the white side or off
color<00:00:46.530> side<00:00:47.239> facing<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.820> you're<00:00:50.820> going

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
color side facing you and you're going

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.439 
color side facing you and you're going
to<00:00:51.210> fold<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:52.590> piece<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.340> half<00:00:56.210> open<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> back

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to fold your piece in half open it back

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
to fold your piece in half open it back
up<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.820> then<00:00:59.820> fold<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.510> sides<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
up and then fold the sides to that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.929 
up and then fold the sides to that
center<00:01:03.420> line<00:01:03.619> into<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.860> line<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.140> side

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
center line into that line so one side

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.640 
center line into that line so one side
and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> other<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.990> then<00:01:12.990> open<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.470> back

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and then the other and then open it back

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.870 
and then the other and then open it back
up<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> will<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.950> divided<00:01:17.700> your

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
up so you will then have divided your

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.330 
up so you will then have divided your
paper<00:01:18.470> into<00:01:19.470> four<00:01:20.299> sections<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.250> what<00:01:23.250> you're

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
paper into four sections and what you're

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
paper into four sections and what you're
going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.670> next<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.360> take<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> pair<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
going to do next is take a pair of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.380 
going to do next is take a pair of
scissors<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.189> cut<00:01:26.880> off<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.960> last<00:01:28.200> section<00:01:28.770> so

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
scissors and cut off the last section so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
scissors and cut off the last section so
you're<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.720> left<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.200> three<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're going to be left with three of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.920 
you're going to be left with three of
the<00:01:32.250> four<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> cut<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the four so you're going to cut one of

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.670 
the four so you're going to cut one of
these<00:01:34.110> sections<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
these sections off and and then the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.249 
these sections off and and then the
section<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.159> has<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.450> three<00:01:39.840> that's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
section that has the the three that's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.660 
section that has the the three that's
left<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.280> we're<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.610> using

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
left that's what we're going to be using

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
left that's what we're going to be using
to<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.390> our<00:01:42.600> chair<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> had<00:01:46.079> my<00:01:46.200> piece<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
to make our chair so I had my piece of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.899 
to make our chair so I had my piece of
paper<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.549> cut<00:01:47.850> off<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.229> these<00:01:50.189> four

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
paper and I cut off one of these four

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.840 
paper and I cut off one of these four
sections<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.170> now<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.850> three

like so alright so we folded your paper

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.590 
like so alright so we folded your paper
down<00:02:11.030> in<00:02:11.660> half<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:13.000> next<00:02:14.000> what<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.270> want<00:02:14.480> to

down in half and next what you want to
do<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:15.050> fold<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.860> corners<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.800> those<00:02:20.080> lines

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
do is fold the corners in to those lines

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.310 
do is fold the corners in to those lines
and<00:02:21.910> then<00:02:22.910> fold<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.660> right<00:02:23.810> back<00:02:23.990> out<00:02:24.200> because

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
down the triangular bit that's created

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.820 
down the triangular bit that's created
by<00:02:42.530> those<00:02:42.770> corner<00:02:43.250> folds<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.660> first<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.650> one

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
by those corner folds so first the one

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.350 
by those corner folds so first the one
side<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.700> other<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:47.060> you're

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
this one is a boomerang plane so I guess

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.939

when<00:04:34.669> you<00:04:34.789> fly<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.690> spins<00:04:36.470> around<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
when you fly it it spins around and

when you fly it it spins around and
comes<00:04:37.220> back<00:04:37.460> at<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.810> will<00:04:38.930> be<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.080> fun
