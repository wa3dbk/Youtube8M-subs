bottle and I only used one finger now
let's<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.750> detail

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.319 

here's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> technique<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> need<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> perform

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
here's the technique you need to perform

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.109 
here's the technique you need to perform
this<00:01:30.570> trick<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.579> hard

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this trick actually it's not that hard

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.740 
this trick actually it's not that hard
the<00:01:33.780> secret<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.720> moisten<00:01:36.720> your

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the secret is that you moisten your

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.710 
the secret is that you moisten your
finger<00:01:37.280> with<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> celeea<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.540> your

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

finger with a bit of celeea from your
tongue<00:01:40.280> like<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.930> now<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.350> will<00:01:43.530> stick<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
tongue like so and now it will stick to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
tongue like so and now it will stick to
the<00:01:44.340> bill<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> hit<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:47.689> your<00:01:48.689> finger

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the bill so when you hit it your finger

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
will stick to the bill and it will be

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.109 
will stick to the bill and it will be
quite<00:01:51.750> easy<00:01:52.020> actually<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:53.100> remove<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
quite easy actually to remove it it
