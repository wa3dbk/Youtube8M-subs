quick<00:04:35.349> little<00:04:35.620> tender<00:04:36.039> in<00:04:36.400> now<00:04:37.210> this<00:04:37.810> I

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
quick little tender in now this I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.420 
quick little tender in now this I
figured<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.860> will<00:04:39.009> kind<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.280> be<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.400> little

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
figured it will kind of be a little

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.270 
figured it will kind of be a little
difficult<00:04:39.729> because<00:04:40.650> if<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:41.770> just<00:04:41.949> want<00:04:42.159> right

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
difficult because if you just want right

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.149 
difficult because if you just want right
here<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.789> it<00:04:42.880> matches<00:04:43.090> up<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:43.509> there<00:04:44.159> right

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
here and it matches up with there right

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.710 
here and it matches up with there right
there<00:04:45.370> so<00:04:45.820> what<00:04:46.000> if<00:04:46.090> you're<00:04:46.210> like<00:04:46.360> trying<00:04:46.539> to

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
put your foot in like very sad and you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.270 
put your foot in like very sad and you
just<00:04:48.669> can't<00:04:49.000> get<00:04:49.509> it<00:04:49.570> on<00:04:50.500> there<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.070> have<00:04:51.250> to

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
just can't get it on there you have to

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.010 
just can't get it on there you have to
wait<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:51.699> his<00:04:51.789> lineup<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.330> push<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.840> in<00:04:52.990> there
