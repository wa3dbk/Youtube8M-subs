00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
fun compositional tool is it provided me

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.030 
fun compositional tool is it provided me
with<00:04:39.780> ideas<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.380> might<00:04:40.560> not<00:04:40.710> have<00:04:40.740> thought

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
with ideas that I might not have thought

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.300 
with ideas that I might not have thought
of<00:04:41.220> when<00:04:41.639> playing<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.000> regular<00:04:42.270> guitar<00:04:43.310> let's

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
of when playing a regular guitar let's

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.590 
of when playing a regular guitar let's
check<00:04:44.520> out<00:04:44.669> what<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.910> instrument<00:04:45.180> sounds

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
check out what the instrument sounds

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.120 
check out what the instrument sounds
like<00:04:45.780> plugged<00:04:46.080> into<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.440> Fishman<00:04:46.919> loud

box<00:04:47.400> 100<00:04:47.880> amp<00:04:48.060> I'm<00:04:48.990> going<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.380> start<00:04:49.650> out<00:04:49.770> using

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
box 100 amp I'm going to start out using

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.100 
box 100 amp I'm going to start out using
just<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.550> pickup<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.240> then<00:04:51.390> dial<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:51.840> one<00:04:51.990> of

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
the aura images here's what it sounds

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.529 
the aura images here's what it sounds
with<00:04:55.650> just<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.040> pickup<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.700> onboard<00:04:56.880> EQ

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.540 

and<00:05:19.440> here's<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.590> multi-tool<00:05:20.950> using<00:05:21.370> one<00:05:21.520> of

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
and here's the multi-tool using one of

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.400 
and here's the multi-tool using one of
the<00:05:21.700> oral<00:05:22.030> imagers<00:05:22.390> also<00:05:22.780> going<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:22.960> boost<00:05:23.260> the

the oral imagers also going to boost the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
base a little bit on it so that's the go

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.430 
base a little bit on it so that's the go
down<00:05:55.720> mood

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
down mood

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.750 
down mood
I'm<00:05:56.620> sure<00:05:56.800> that<00:05:56.950> someone<00:05:57.160> who<00:05:57.310> has<00:05:57.430> really

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
I'm sure that someone who has really

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.550 
I'm sure that someone who has really
studied<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.180> ODE<00:05:58.330> could<00:05:58.930> do<00:05:59.080> much<00:05:59.530> more

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
studied the ODE could do much more

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.890 
studied the ODE could do much more
justice<00:06:00.190> to<00:06:00.370> its<00:06:00.490> capabilities<00:06:01.120> but<00:06:01.570> I<00:06:01.630> found

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
justice to its capabilities but I found

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.090 
justice to its capabilities but I found
that<00:06:02.020> it<00:06:02.140> even<00:06:02.350> offers<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.860> lot<00:06:03.070> of

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
that it even offers a lot of

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.460 
that it even offers a lot of
possibilities<00:06:03.310> for<00:06:03.820> guitarists<00:06:04.600> I<00:06:04.750> had<00:06:05.290> never

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
possibilities for guitarists I had never

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.810 
possibilities for guitarists I had never
played<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.770> nude<00:06:05.980> before<00:06:06.160> checking<00:06:06.550> this<00:06:06.760> one

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
played a nude before checking this one

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.670 
played a nude before checking this one
out<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.510> I<00:06:07.600> didn't<00:06:07.840> having<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.110> lot<00:06:08.410> of<00:06:08.440> fun
