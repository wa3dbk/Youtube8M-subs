00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.160
 in this video we will learn to decorate 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.019
 a tree is very important the choice 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.400
 of the tree type depending a little on 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.430
 the characteristics of our house 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.610
 let's choose the width the size and the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.439
 height in this case we have chosen the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.089
 pencil model that you can find here 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.099
 in green - that now that it is a 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.539
 tree model that is a little bit more 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.980
 narrow what we are used to 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.449
 there are different styles in green 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 now for example where did I show 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 a more traditional style with 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.590
 red tones with the typical 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.080
 golden then another collection that is the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.950
 golden silver with silver colors and 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.570
 golden intermingled or alone and by 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.340
 last the calm collection that is the one that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.590
 We will use and ornaments in color 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.080
 white with a more rustic character with 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.450
 Toasted tones with shades or 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.640
 brush strokes of blue color once chosen 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.670
 and the style with which we are going to decorate 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.829
 the tree first place is the lights 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 we have chosen a garland of lights 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.829
 LEDs with blue tones and giving you the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.070
 back to the tree 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.700
 we must engage with a branch 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.700
 i 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.520
 the important thing is that from luminosity to 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.520
 long 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.580
 they should not stay too far outside 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.500
 get inside the tree 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.180
 and an aspect to keep in mind so 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.190
 place a timer so that it 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.590
 turn off and never leave it for 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.240
 nights lit the second element to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.670
 use is a garland and in this case 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.130
 we have taken a white these are going to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.870
 bring a lot of light and they are a little 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.940
 different from the Christmas hell that 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.740
 We are accustomed to use 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.090
 agreement 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.090
 let's make layers 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.659
 Y 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.700
 once we have placed the covers 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.700
 We are going to choose them for the ornaments 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.740
 we have chosen these are some ornaments 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.050
 socks with wings and little angels 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.940
 to see a little of the typical balls 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.210
 that can also be combined with these 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.380
 with these objects we can reuse 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.360
 endless ornaments that we have at home 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.820
 from different years but this time 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.200
 we have chosen these two in the first place 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.690
 let's place the biggest ones that are 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.120
 what are the socks and we will go 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.370
 alternating always in the gaps are the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.690
 spaces that have been left once 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.690
 placed the garlands 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.230
 an important way to place them not 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.300
 is to leave them like that but we would put together the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.420
 strip around the fir we would give 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.580
 turns and we will double the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.819
 the spruce so that the adornment is 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.890
 Attached to the fir branch is important 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.170
 place these ornaments very purpose 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.880
 little bit bigger in the spaces more 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.989
 large where no gaps have been created 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.989
 once placed the garlands 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.060
 ah 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.630
 It is also very important not to leave 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.520
 place the ornaments on the part in the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.960
 lower part of the tree because they would touch 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.360
 in its liquidate an aspect as of 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.220
 heaviness that the ornament throws to the tree 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.700
 so I think the number of 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.920
 ornaments would be a little bit this go placing 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.140
 go see where the holes where where 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.590
 there is more space to place the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.590
 ornament 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.280
 let's go placing the ornaments that are 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.140
 smaller and with toasted tones in the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.900
 holes that have been left of the 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.650
 garland and the little angels 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.650
 we will always start from top to bottom 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.219
 and the placement is the same as we have 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.670
 explained with the socks pegaditos a 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:06.670
 the branch 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.140
 you do not have to fill the tree too much 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.700
 It is not very motley because then 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.850
 you only see a cluster of ornaments and 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:26.360
 you do not see 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:28.760
 really the decoration once already 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.200
 we have decorated 'workshop something and missing a 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.750
 most fundamental element the part 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.940
 superior is quite traditional that 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.410
 star places but we that 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.320
 says that I've decided to give it an air 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.150
 different and that's why we have chosen some 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.370
 angel wings to place on the tip 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.600
 from the tree these angel wings do not 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.270
 they only serve to decorate the tree 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.729
 but also to decorate the chairs 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.889
 and we're going to put them on the tip 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.180
 well with this we wanted to show you 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.659
 the decoration of an album a little bit 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.129
 different and you can combine 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.979
 these elements together with others that 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.800
 have in your house as balls ornaments of 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.210
 different years of different colors 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.749
 but we have wanted to show you something 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.749
 different 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.090
 or not
