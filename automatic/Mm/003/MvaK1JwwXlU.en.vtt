00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.410
 very good to all friends of 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:05.850
 youtube how are you here one more day 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.310
 as always I have put friend party 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:15.059
 commenting and well after just 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:17.250
 get out the first teaser of pcs 2015 and not 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.470
 you can see too much in the teaser a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.690
 couple of significant images but 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 you can not either take a 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.310
 too relevant conclusion not about 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.600
 that topic the truth is that he has called me 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.660
 the attention the snow so maybe you can 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.090
 there is snow in the new fish 2015 but 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.340
 for me it's really the least 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.810
 because what I want is that it changes the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.960
 playability that is a gameplay 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.240
 better than the gameplay that I had 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.850
 because it has face 2014 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.110
 that really is not the same one that has 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.820
 the 2015 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.950
 that is something different because it is that if 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 they are not basically going to sell us the same 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.940
 game although there is snow though 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.860
 add a couple of things but if the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.570
 gameplay is the same going to be the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.400
 same game practically as in 2014 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.950
 so 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.590
 the truth is that I would like 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.910
 I went back more or less to what it was in 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.540
 2013 in playability especially I do not know 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.910
 open 2006 evidently with graphics 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.580
 different etcetera no but but the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.310
 playability that there is a change in the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.200
 playability that I can 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.190
 go well with the game that's what 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.570
 I really care so I do not know 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.000
 you can not see too much 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.860
 we do not like to be and neither am I going to go up 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.170
 the trailers because basically 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.210
 with no new policies youtube 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.100
 you can upload or iteisa trailers already 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.110
 that you can get a strike or 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.390
 anything and you can close the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.260
 account that you have to have it enough in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.450
 account 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.600
 It's worth last year, yes, yes, I went up 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.660
 trailers and tennis I hope with the new 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.290
 Youtube policies at the end of this 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.530
 year they changed because they started me 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.760
 jump out of copyright claims 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.190
 then I had to delete the videos 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.280
 as if you realize then if you see in 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.800
 my channel the videos of the trailers that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.480
 I went up after 2014 so as no longer 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.630
 they were because I was erasing not because 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.209
 I skip the claim then and have 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.270
 be careful when climbing if you upload trailers 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.300
 or maybe because I can get you a strike of 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.630
 youtube you can have a strike and said 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.600
 this, I say 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.480
 they have also said the date of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.710
 launch of the first gameplay of 2015 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.690
 that will be the day to your friends July 25 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.330
 July 25 will be the day on which 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.770
 will show for the first time the gameplay of 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.130
 the expected football delivery of 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.280
 Conavi is worth noting that because of the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.890
 launch of teix apps 2015 for me 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.260
 he has also redesigned his website 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.069
 where they show us the new motto of the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.560
 franchise from pitch is ours 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.689
 the playing field is our do not want 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.790
 say which is a statement of 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.319
 confidence in the quality of quality 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.909
 of the title and a guarantee that the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.790
 Perez's goal remains the 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.520
 playing field then this would have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.070
 to think it makes me think then 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.170
 notice the statement leaves the ground of 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.510
 game is ours then what do you want 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.240
 say that the gameplay has been focused 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.030
 that is going to return that weight that we 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.910
 illusion esp is that when 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.260
 we took what could be the console 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.020
 we started playing and we did not stop 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.770
 playing matches, we played 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.230
 hours back to that weight really I 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.150
 I hope so and I hope it continues that 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.760
 phrase to me fills me with hope and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:57.930
 illusion but it is a phrase that if you read it 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.930
 with pause and you notice a lot 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.690
 can that mean whatever we want 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.360
 things within the gameplay and lola has 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.920
 considerably improved so that the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.500
 game is much more attractive to the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.780
 time to play it and get hooked between 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.540
 quotes not at all and good finally 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.420
 friends is that kampusch kobayashi has 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.150
 revealed that next Thursday 19 of 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.450
 June will be a play test like this 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.710
 all friends as this it the own 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.190
 news that is 2015 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.710
 I do not know what you think you think 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.110
 The truth is that 20 years of 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.139
 the saga of pro evolution soccer 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.300
 in this 2015 and the truth is that it has 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.729
 that being a different fish has to be 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.589
 a weight 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.589
 since he will be 20 years old because he has 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:51.219
 to be something new something out of the 

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:52.990
 common of everything that is 2014 because 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:56.229
 have changed 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.039
 to a better game and then let's hope that 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.580
 so whether it is more or less more than 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.259
 same as in 2014 because the truth is that 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.270
 they will not have evolved anything not then 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.639
 I hope that the gameplay so 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.069
 less the gameplay to me the snow and if 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.830
 they are important factors but I 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.300
 after seeing what I saw with penn 2014 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.139
 that's good with all the updates 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.379
 it's been a better game but but to me 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.559
 it does not matter if there is nobody who adds rain 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.809
 that add a lot of things when the 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.979
 gameplay will continue to be more or 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:32.710
 minus the same then that's going to 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.300
 serve you're going to play a game that is 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.099
 practically the same as 2014 but 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.689
 With snow and water , what's the use? 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.889
 if you're not going to have fun anyway 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.550
 then the gameplay I think is 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.080
 the most important thing and hopefully they have 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.720
 changed in that aspect so 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.449
 I hope you liked the video is 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.000
 celebrating now the e3 fair where 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.180
 more news will come as much weight as 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.780
 fifa 15 who will be reporting so 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.639
 they are not attentive to my channel because 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.550
 you are going to see enough news about weight 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.490
 2015 fifa 15 etc. so it's worth nothing 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.479
 I say goodbye to you and I'll see you in the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.479
 next video
