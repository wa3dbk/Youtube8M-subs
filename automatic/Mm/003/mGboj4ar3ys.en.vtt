being<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.820> frustrated<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
being a little bit frustrated with the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
being a little bit frustrated with the
size<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.080> device<00:01:28.380> even<00:01:28.680> though<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> can

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
size of this device even though I can

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.230 
size of this device even though I can
wrap<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:29.220> hands<00:01:29.430> around<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.820> find<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.180> when

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
wrap my hands around it I find that when

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
wrap my hands around it I find that when
I<00:01:30.360> put<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.630> pocket<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.200> tends<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> stick<00:01:31.799> out

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I put in my pocket it tends to stick out

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
I put in my pocket it tends to stick out
from<00:01:32.490> about<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:33.240> making<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.810> hard

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
from about here up making it really hard

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
from about here up making it really hard

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
find that to be an issue and I'm finding

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.020 
find that to be an issue and I'm finding
you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.220> funny<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.759> look

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you know more it's funny because I look

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.460 
you know more it's funny because I look
in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.479> couple<00:01:45.600> days<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.290> this

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
in the first couple days like a this

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.020 
in the first couple days like a this
isn't<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.770> big<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.070> deal<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> found<00:01:47.939> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
isn't as big of a deal and I found that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240 
isn't as big of a deal and I found that
on<00:01:48.149> day<00:01:48.360> 2<00:01:48.420> n<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.960> day<00:01:49.079> 10<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.350> day<00:01:49.590> 12<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
on day 2 n kind of day 10 and day 12 and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.490 
on day 2 n kind of day 10 and day 12 and
day<00:01:51.030> 14<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.659> creeped<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> where<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> am

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
day 14 is that creeped up to where I am

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.260 
day 14 is that creeped up to where I am
right<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
right now I was like you know what the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.060 
right now I was like you know what the
size<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> an<00:01:55.710> issue<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
size is a little bit of an issue that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
size is a little bit of an issue that
said<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> trade-off<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> find<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
said it's a trade-off and I find it in a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.179 
said it's a trade-off and I find it in a
lot<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.170> stuff<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> make<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
lot of this stuff you got to make a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.740 
lot of this stuff you got to make a
decision<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.299> features<00:02:00.659> are

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
decision for you which features are

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.149 
decision for you which features are
going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.200> important<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.770> yes<00:02:01.979> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
going to be more important so yes this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.190 
going to be more important so yes this
is<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> bigger<00:02:02.640> device<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.780> does<00:02:03.930> pack

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
is a bigger device but what it does pack

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.980 
is a bigger device but what it does pack
is<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.850> 3100<00:02:05.850> milliamp<00:02:06.149> hour<00:02:06.329> battery<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.869> get

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
is a 3100 milliamp hour battery to get

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
is a 3100 milliamp hour battery to get
better<00:02:07.170> battery<00:02:07.590> life<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.039> packs<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.550> larger<00:02:08.910> HD

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
better battery life it packs a larger HD

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.119 
better battery life it packs a larger HD
display<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.869> 5.5<00:02:10.500> inches<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.099> a

display at 5.5 inches so you get a

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.650 
display at 5.5 inches so you get a
bigger<00:02:11.400> display<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.910> work<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.480> have

bigger display to work with you have

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.070 
bigger display to work with you have
cool<00:02:12.900> abilities

to use white that probably wouldn't look
too<00:02:20.200> good<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.830> we<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.070> draw<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.310> these<00:02:21.580> and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
a very useful application I'm also

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.930 
a very useful application I'm also
finding<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.490> talked<00:02:33.670> about<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.910> a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
finding like I talked about in a

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.150 
finding like I talked about in a
previous<00:02:33.970> video<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.410> S<00:02:35.530> Pen<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:35.800> far

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
previous video that the S Pen is far

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.920 
previous video that the S Pen is far
more<00:02:36.310> responsive<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.390> noticed<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.750> it's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
more responsive and I noticed that it's

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.510 
more responsive and I noticed that it's
a<00:02:37.960> lot<00:02:38.110> more<00:02:38.260> responsive<00:02:38.770> more<00:02:38.980> accurate<00:02:39.430> to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
a lot more responsive more accurate to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.460 
a lot more responsive more accurate to
typical<00:02:40.000> writing<00:02:40.420> what<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.660> mean<00:02:40.870> by<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.230> is

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
typical writing what I mean by that is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.410 
typical writing what I mean by that is
when<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.340> look<00:02:42.490> at<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.880> comparison<00:02:43.330> to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
when you look at this in comparison to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.060 
when you look at this in comparison to
the<00:02:43.480> original<00:02:43.570> note<00:02:44.110> you'll<00:02:44.560> find<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:44.950> the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
the original note you'll find that the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.320 
the original note you'll find that the
writing<00:02:45.370> is<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.490> little<00:02:45.640> bit<00:02:45.730> more<00:02:45.820> real<00:02:46.060> you

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
writing is a little bit more real you

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.820 
writing is a little bit more real you
can<00:02:46.480> see<00:02:46.690> for<00:02:46.840> example<00:02:46.930> when<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.380> type<00:02:47.620> my<00:02:47.650> name

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
can see for example when I type my name

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.920 
can see for example when I type my name
that's<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.880> little<00:02:49.060> bit<00:02:49.150> more<00:02:49.330> how<00:02:49.540> my<00:02:49.690> name

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
that's a little bit more how my name

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.540 
that's a little bit more how my name
would<00:02:50.470> actually<00:02:50.890> look<00:02:51.010> if<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.220> were<00:02:51.310> writing

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
would actually look if I were writing

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.430 
would actually look if I were writing
this<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.330> real<00:02:52.600> piece<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.930> paper<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.230> often

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
this on a real piece of paper I often

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.250 
this on a real piece of paper I often
found<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> note<00:02:54.190> one<00:02:54.459> had<00:02:54.880> an<00:02:55.000> issue

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
found that the note one had an issue

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.720 
found that the note one had an issue
transcribing<00:02:56.260> at<00:02:56.530> least<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.920> real<00:02:57.160> way<00:02:57.430> this

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
transcribing at least in a real way this

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.520 
transcribing at least in a real way this
actually<00:02:58.300> looks<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:58.690> my<00:02:58.840> handwriting<00:02:59.140> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
actually looks like my handwriting and
