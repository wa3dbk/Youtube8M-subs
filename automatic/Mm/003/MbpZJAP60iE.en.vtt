00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.660
 Caravan 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.220
 From the eyes of a loner 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 A few drops I stole 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.533
 I sent you this morning 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.200

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.840
 Loaded from myself 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.140
 I buy, I can't sell 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 I can't swallow. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.760

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.840
