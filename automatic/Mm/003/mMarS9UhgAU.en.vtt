iron and a blow-dryer the first step is
find<00:00:26.429> your<00:00:26.550> part<00:00:26.880> sometimes<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.749> want<00:00:27.929> to<00:00:27.990> do

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.180 
a low part on cat purrs is really strong
right<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.259> I<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.349> went<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:31.919> it

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190 
right here so I just went with it

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.130 
right here so I just went with it
the<00:00:32.400> next<00:00:32.700> step<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.150> take<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> volumizing

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the next step is to take the volumizing

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.320 
the next step is to take the volumizing
spray<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.620> spray<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.340> well<00:00:35.550> under<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> hair

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
spray and spray it well under the hair

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330 
spray and spray it well under the hair
so<00:00:36.810> what<00:00:36.990> this<00:00:37.110> does<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.560> help<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.890> create<00:00:38.250> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so what this does is help to create a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850 
so what this does is help to create a
stacking<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.720> hair<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.740> it's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
stacking to the hair you can see it's

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
stacking to the hair you can see it's
already<00:00:41.130> getting<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.700> good<00:00:41.850> lift<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.750> next

already getting a good lift the next

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.780 
already getting a good lift the next

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
down and hit it underneath the hair so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.710

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
they also have a little bit of hold so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.860 
they also have a little bit of hold so
that<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> use<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.400> iron<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.120> sets<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.750> in

give you a nice section in the back
and<00:01:35.770> then<00:01:36.250> clip<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.910> hair<00:01:37.360> out<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.870> way<00:01:37.930> so

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
and then clip the hair out of the way so

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.380 
and then clip the hair out of the way so
to<00:01:38.800> start<00:01:39.160> with<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.460> what<00:01:39.940> I'm<00:01:40.030> going<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.210> do

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
to start with on what I'm going to do

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.910 
to start with on what I'm going to do
that<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.960> key<00:01:41.230> point<00:01:41.530> here<00:01:41.680> is

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
that and this is a key point here is

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.400 
that and this is a key point here is
this<00:01:42.550> row<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.300> all<00:01:43.540> going<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.810> be<00:01:43.900> moving<00:01:44.290> in

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
this row is all going to be moving in

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.860 
this row is all going to be moving in
one<00:01:44.590> direction<00:01:44.940> when<00:01:45.940> I<00:01:45.970> get<00:01:46.180> into<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.510> second

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
one direction when I get into the second

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.420 
one direction when I get into the second
row<00:01:46.990> it'll<00:01:47.410> be<00:01:47.500> moving<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.040> opposite

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
row it'll be moving in the opposite

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.610 
row it'll be moving in the opposite
direction<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:49.120> what<00:01:49.690> this<00:01:49.810> does<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.440> helps

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
direction and what this does is it helps

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.820 
direction and what this does is it helps
create<00:01:51.160> that<00:01:51.190> stack<00:01:51.760> effect<00:01:52.000> one<00:01:52.480> and<00:01:52.780> two<00:01:53.500> it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
create that stack effect one and two it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.920 
create that stack effect one and two it
gives<00:01:54.160> away<00:01:54.820> from<00:01:55.150> inch<00:01:55.360> into<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.660> hair

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
gives away from inch into the hair

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.780 
gives away from inch into the hair
you're<00:01:56.380> going<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:56.740> about<00:01:56.890> four<00:01:57.370> or<00:01:57.580> five

others is the two front sections are

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.370 
others is the two front sections are
both<00:02:15.970> going<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.330> moving<00:02:16.720> away<00:02:16.870> from<00:02:17.080> the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
both going to be moving away from the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.470 
both going to be moving away from the
face<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:18.250> rest<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.030> going<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.360> be

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
face the rest of it is going to be

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.810

moving<00:02:19.840> all<00:02:19.990> in<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> same<00:02:20.620> direction<00:02:20.830> now

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
moving all in the same direction now

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.550

what<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> did<00:02:22.240> different<00:02:22.570> for<00:02:22.720> Christina<00:02:23.110> was<00:02:23.380> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
what I did different for Christina was I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.290 
what I did different for Christina was I
dropped<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.430> little<00:02:24.730> bit<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:25.150> going<00:02:25.270> to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
dropped it a little bit so I'm going to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.510 
dropped it a little bit so I'm going to
take<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.690> hair<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.170> roll<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> back<00:02:26.620> there's<00:02:27.430> a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
take the hair and roll it back there's a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.100 
take the hair and roll it back there's a
little<00:02:27.790> bit<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.910> drag<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.510> hair<00:02:28.780> right<00:02:28.959> in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
little bit of drag to the hair right in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.940 
little bit of drag to the hair right in
there<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.470> what<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:29.920> does<00:02:30.310> is<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.300> helps<00:02:31.630> it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
there and what that does is it helps it

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.440 
there and what that does is it helps it
to<00:02:32.950> look<00:02:33.130> more<00:02:33.370> modern<00:02:33.610> where<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.060> comes<00:02:34.270> down

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
to look more modern where it comes down

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.240 
to look more modern where it comes down
instead<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.990> having<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.410> lot<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.590> wave<00:02:35.830> up<00:02:36.070> down

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
instead of having a lot of wave up down

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.040 
instead of having a lot of wave up down
the<00:02:36.400> front<00:02:36.550> last<00:02:36.940> step<00:02:37.209> what<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.390> want<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.720> do<00:02:37.840> is
