00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.760
 there is a hello everyone knows 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.920
 sardinha so we end up 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.900
 today for a little video on 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.059
 black ops of on search and destruction 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.949
 so it's a knife gameplay 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.269
 fighting and fighting ax or 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.790
 automatic that's you who see 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.710
 then you will surely have noticed 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.390
 the introduction of qg code and cf codes 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.010
 at the beginning of the video and everything 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.350
 simply because I conclude dismiss my 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.850
 video I think the subject we 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.250
 let's go into this risk video 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.690
 to please them then before approaching this 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.280
 subject strictly speaking I first 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.320
 talked a little bit about the video in 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.460
 she even then as I wanted 17 a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.160
 little gameplay in search and 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.680
 destruction with the fighting knife 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.640
 an equipment that I do not have 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.470
 the habit of using 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.789
 and if I admit that I had released a good 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 little gameplay for research and 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.610
 destruction but you'll see it I'm going 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.840
 not tell you again the score I have 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.970
 done but it's quite a score 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.759
 honorable in research and destruction 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.979
 so I played with the drone the drone 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.679
 hunting and the strategic package in 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.240
 score strikes is also the grenades 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.680
 flash finally I think it was the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.380
 flash grenades but regardless it did 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.460
 not really important 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.939
 so we will also want you 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.930
 well talk about the subject we're going 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.579
 tackle there are we going all 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.079
 just talk about the chains 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.000
 in this video 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.549
 and although this is a subject dear to my 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.780
 heart to speak in this video because I 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.700
 finds that it is not often discussed 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.920
 in youtube videos though this is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.409
 true we call all of them 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.840
 all those gameplay on it 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.909
 the channels but we rarely talk about 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.549
 his compassion by rarely chains 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.079
 community etc. what should they 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.060
 can serve that's it's getting a little 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.209
 mechanical to post I'm going to say 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.620
 videos on community channels and 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.820
 in the end it's true concert we even know 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.290
 more what they serve these channels 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.090
 so I think it was interesting 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.220
 to come back to what she could 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.350
 serve 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.870
 gold goal and it's so good it's true that 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.660
 I often see he hears mostly it's 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.120
 rather I often hear youtuber 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.100
 to say that they will go on a chain 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.510
 community to have a lot 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.340
 subscribers so to have a maximum 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.150
 of subscribers then indeed I think that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.160
 that's one of the reasons 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.110
 I think it must not be the only one 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.420
 reasons that push to pass on 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.140
 a community channel 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.850
 personally passing on 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.830
 a community channel can me 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.290
 finally allow can allow people 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.940
 first of all to watch my videos and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.400
 to entertain them eventually any 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.230
 depends on the type of videos I post and 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.120
 can also allow to do 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.090
 know my job if I can say my 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.640
 passion earlier while the chain and 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.290
 5000 10000 without a thousand million 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.630
 subscribers personally it does not matter to me 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.220
 little is true that if cities and 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.500
 finally people subscribe to my channel 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.090
 it's all the more profitable but good 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.400
 it will not be my concern my concern 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.080
 principal one will say then it must not 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.420
 forget or not that a chain 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.760
 Community does not only serve a 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.470
 people to dd gameplay but serves 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.390
 also to entertain the community of 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.920
 video game and some channels 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.010
 even make it possible to learn things 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.570
 on editing software like sony 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.940
 vegas photoshop etc 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.230
 we're not going to tell them what to do 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.080
 they can finally what they can 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.340
 learn but here are some chains 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.660
 allow you to learn things and 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.269
 it's really awesome 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.860
 then there are also youtuber too 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.790
 they are trying to send gameplay 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.790
 every day to the chains 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 without necessarily putting it 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.350
 all the chances on their side for 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.870
 to say to spend all they want 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.340
 it happened on the 100 channel I think 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.310
 provide quality content 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.870
 by force they try to pass there 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.100
 not happen and then they all ask 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.239
 days harassing the chains 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.200
 Community and I think at the end 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.630
 it ends up soul is then passed on 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.980
 a big chain like code qg and coast 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.940
 cf even the others huh I 'll say he 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.709
 are many other community channels 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.850
 but I think that going on a chain 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.910
 community is worth it 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.220
 and that's really saying 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.410
 put thoroughly to say it really 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.430
 passed over 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.590
 so here's what I can 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.880
 to do is to give you maybe 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.010
 some quick tips to say 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.180
 to be plots of the most easily on his 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.250
 different channels 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.580
 like a land so I think it 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.800
 must first of all that your video your 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.780
 subject is original so that is to say 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.449
 that for example you have to talk about a 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.130
 interesting topic or your video should 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.199
 be the same if you post on black ops 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.850
 in this case be a correct gameplay 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.720
 not going to make a bad gameplay for 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.880
 to say to pass in front of a chain 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.830
 still community though it depends 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.210
 a little eh it's true that I've already seen 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.470
 people with gameplay for there 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.509
 go on a community channel but 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.830
 it may be a bit of a video 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.620
 particular who's talking about something else 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.479
 finally here but Thursday as a rule 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.509
 it's true that your video needs to be 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.550
 acceptable good quality anyway 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.620
 your subject you must also it must 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.490
 also be an original subject or a 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.789
 subject we do not often talk about 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.199
 this is then you must also be 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.849
 comfortable speaking so that is not 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.590
 necessarily be comfortable in the sense that 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.630
 you leave whites where you say 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.699
 a lot of 2 e 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.800
 here is in the video it does not necessarily 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.530
 too much importance what is important 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.960
 it is especially so for two I would say 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.479
 to be comfortable but it does not mean 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.070
 of course not to say not to 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.599
 repeat all the same words it wants 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.680
 also to know his subject well 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.780
 as I said earlier and 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.449
 frankly show that you are 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.370
 really comfortable with a microphone and that 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.830
 you can comment a part is 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.419
 adorned with a variety of topics then you 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.940
 must also know your 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.639
 subject that it's sure then it is necessary that 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.260
 the message you send is 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.240
 nice for the community channel 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.750
 which binds him so that is to say if you 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.540
 want to send a little gain 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.680
