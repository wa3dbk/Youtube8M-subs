00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 it's getting harder and harder to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.730
 meet a girl and watched her 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.980
 natural complexion in abidjan the phenomenon of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.980
 depigmentation of the skin reaches 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.990
 10.6 worrying proportions 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.810
 the phenomenon has developed to such an extent 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.290
 that he did not escape the vigilance of the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:37.079
 sociologists this is a phenomenon that dates 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.520
 times since backed up and the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.270
 accurate literature that already as much 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 Pharaonic 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.120
 there were young Egyptians who 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 would use products 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.899
 lightening compared to others and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.309
 you know in a context that can 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.960
 aim for white skin to document the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.940
 skin looks like an act 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.090
 of self-defense and its part of the states 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.329
 united that the bad movie will spread in 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.030
 west i say to the eyes in europe and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.840
 thereafter in africa targeting 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.909
 first countries 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.869
 hartford and then francophones and after 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.210
 Portuguese-speaking countries 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.979
 the prevalence of these farms in hill 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.869
 of ivory lie around 6 in 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.380
 imposing on the literature 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.299
 if I do a few comparisons 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.100
 if all a bit high at the level of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.570
 Senegal, which reached about before in 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 removing from its 10% at the level of mali a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.880
 a little over 25% 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.619
 but in Togo the rate is around 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.600
 passers-by signal this is a movie a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.439
 human being is doing a wall in the middle 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.270
 urban urban then it's a 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.520
 film that essentially affects 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.670
 women much more women than 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.740
 men and if you take us to the level 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.850
 of age 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.149
 it is particularly the population 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.200
 I help young people the young population 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.350
 of course there are adults but the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.680
 youth population from 15 to 34 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.640
 according to 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.410
 the a calculation of amaury asia yes and what 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 to variables in costume can also 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.710
 subsidized washing but it must 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.180
 it's simple that touches all 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.410
 socio-professional layers and there I 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.690
 I could not talk about doing 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.650
 very sharp studies for for better 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.010
 appreciate the situation 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.690
 now what are the motivations 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.230
 she wants to look like the woman 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.390
 Eastern 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.820
 but for the main ones concerned the 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.459
 first reason is the desire to 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.070
 make beautiful my cam oil decades 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.530
 under mac and they get married despite that 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.530
 the regretted because for the foundry 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.100
 the elysee does it to be in madmen in 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.100
 stern and cost-based 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.300
 however the player the world sees the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.100
 automatisms that we can see that is not 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.650
 improve in May and then try 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.290
 feathered pau May 10 will say it all 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.970
 yes segments are mounted to words like 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.440
 this I do it finally it's well it's 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.800
 not ride she has 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.490
 is not it I like to do 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.340
 thematic is essential is there high 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.340
 I take bad words that their hosts 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.090
 even if I did it, but it paid 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.360
 the challenge 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.930
 I like it that's less when it's 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.329
 did that to me baghdad and iran 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.469
 and do a long time mom not 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.230
 Yemenia of workshop 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:38.989
 anyone who has inherited know why 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.150
 why does not anyone arrange 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.270
 first it suits us not harmful a 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.860
 chrono taking the jury 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.290
 average time for a long time that has me 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.430
 well done but public authorities do not 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.340
 are not of this opinion 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.890
 the Ivorian government has thus decided 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.630
 last April 29 to withdraw from 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.660
 market all cosmetics 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.510
 lightening to hygiene containing 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.880
 hydroquinone of mercury and its derivatives 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.670
 corticosteroids or vitamin a 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.200
 beyond a rate of 2% men 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.470
 love women who shine at night 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.900
 distills because its bright she 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.610
 fate she brings light the stars 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.489
 shine in the room that's it and 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.950
 unfortunately the understanding of 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.860
 this appreciation makes women 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.510
 often indulges in the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.180
 depigmentation of their skin with all 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.010
 the consequences that we know the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.440
 working principle of the cream 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.030
 lightening is simple in fact 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.310
 she destroys working evil 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.380
 a skin that is not sick for 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.510
 decrease the production of melanin 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.180
 she uses dangerous substances 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.450
 that make the body sick is a 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.370
 door open to all aggression 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.710
 microbial outer every 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.730
 microbes now finds a pump 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.700
 time taken for a little crossing the skin 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:02.420
 to have attacked the skin went beyond 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:09.370
 skin there too it's not good 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:14.920
 then if at the beginning we decided 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.920
 to be spiced up to be 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.900
 tel poet rest and that in the end the 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.690
 medical consequences make that we do not 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.850
 can even more undress us 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.160
 in front of others we are 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.500
 obliged to always have the body 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:38.590
 covered dhabi and stone did it 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.930
 the primary goal is not achieved and 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.050
 we even pushed back by the partners 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.910
 we're over here spleen from this 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.510
 moment there given these 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.700
 consequences 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.370
 given the fact that they had to 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.950
 end we have more desirable I think he 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.080
 better not to start studying 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.180
 prevalence are rare in terms of 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.680
 lightening products and figures 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.630
 vary from one study to another 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.020
 but according to a study of the united nations 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.910
 dating from 2008 Nigerian women beats 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.890
 the record of using products 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.710
 lightening in Africa 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.740
 the fight will be difficult to watch 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.450
 diverging interests at stake between 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.700
 manufacturers whose turnover 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.150
 is estimated at several billion 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.370
 CFA francs a year and the rulers 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.030
 mindful of the imperatives of 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.030
 public health
