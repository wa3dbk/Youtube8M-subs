00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
guys exactly how I do that it takes me

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.510 
guys exactly how I do that it takes me
like<00:05:17.330> two<00:05:17.569> minutes<00:05:17.599> or<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:18.229> ship<00:05:18.560> an<00:05:18.680> item<00:05:18.770> what

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
like two minutes or so ship an item what

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.860 
like two minutes or so ship an item what
you<00:05:19.610> think<00:05:19.789> is<00:05:19.880> better<00:05:20.060> than<00:05:20.300> most<00:05:20.509> peoples

you think is better than most peoples

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.379 
you think is better than most peoples
and<00:05:21.050> it's<00:05:21.139> certainly<00:05:21.319> cheaper<00:05:21.909> and<00:05:22.909> more<00:05:23.240> than

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
and it's certainly cheaper and more than

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.670 
and it's certainly cheaper and more than
that<00:05:23.509> though<00:05:23.719> I<00:05:23.750> did<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.110> whole<00:05:24.379> bunch<00:05:24.590> of

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
that though I did a whole bunch of

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.180 
that though I did a whole bunch of
