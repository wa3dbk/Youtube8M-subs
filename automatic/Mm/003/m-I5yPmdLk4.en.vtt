00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.340
 here in santa marinella in the headquarters of the child jesus in particular mine 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.009
 rehabilitation 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.069
 we have been working for several years 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.279
 with robotic tools penalizing 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.259
 to these tools that we use several years we have added a system 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.730
 special robot 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 and that has a somewhat difficult name to sign 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.869
 called me exoskeleton is a system that you wear 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.719
 and that once worn allows Applezein calls you spinal injury 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 and that therefore they have no chance of standing up and of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.270
 to walk 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.540
 defects to buy this type of mortgage loan then the president 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.540
 once worn with adequate training 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.520
 who becomes capable of standing upright to walk to do the 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.520
 uphill and downhill stairs below 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.850
 - we use these skeletal guys 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.619
 why not have a minimum height of one meter p50 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.200
 our goal obviously those to develop supportive systems for 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.130
 small children from the age of 4 but at the moment this sea of 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.080
 search 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.470
 that I still have not found any answer worldwide 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.990
 further reducing the height by a few centimeters is something that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.560
 we have already done that then we will continue to do in the coming months 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.340
 to get to a skeletal system usable with a very child 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 small and you have to wait a few 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.359
 the exoskeleton that you have seen before only a part of one activity 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.270
 robotic equipment that for several years has led a victory of - 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.140
 you will find a device was 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.899
 it is entirely designed for love 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 as a child jesus economy wisdom university of rome and then have 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.059
 realized in collaboration with 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.679
 thirst thirst thirsty 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.999
 etymology of mail 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.999
 is a device for robotic rehabilitation 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:28.629
 the system you have been testing some research companies require some 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.109
 smoke movements you tell me about movies 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.099
 good day everyone 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.219
 particular 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.019
 it was to improve foot control even in this type of patient
