00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
of us can say we actually changed the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
of us can say we actually changed the
game<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.720> actually<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> fire<00:01:37.619> caves

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
game so we actually got to fire caves

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.039 
game so we actually got to fire caves
they<00:01:38.159> motivated<00:01:38.729> jagex<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> redo<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> fight

they motivated jagex to redo the fight
cave<00:01:40.320> system<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.820> he<00:01:42.030> motivated

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
cave system a little bit so he motivated

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
cave system a little bit so he motivated
us<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.990> able<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.530> than<00:01:43.710> 25<00:01:44.399> or

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
us to be able to get more than 25 or

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
more than one that fire cape in fact so

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.109 
more than one that fire cape in fact so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
people he motivated to try this system

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.749 
people he motivated to try this system
because<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> lot<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> people<00:01:52.920> tried<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> after
