jump<00:01:28.320> cuts<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> that's<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.310> I'm<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
jump cuts and that's because I'm the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.420 
jump cuts and that's because I'm the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it's a little hard doing both at the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's a little hard doing both at the
same<00:01:33.750> time<00:01:33.990> say<00:01:34.470> something<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.009> those

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
same time say something that to do those

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.330 
same time say something that to do those
low<00:01:35.310> jump<00:01:35.640> cuts<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.119> order<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:37.650> unbox

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
low jump cuts in order to actually unbox
