thing<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.229> Milani<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
thing because the Milani one is so

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249 
thing because the Milani one is so
creamy<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.570> blend<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> out

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
creamy that you do have to blend it out

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.069 
creamy that you do have to blend it out
but<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> does<00:01:41.280> neutralize<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.299> eyelid<00:01:42.720> very

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
but it does neutralize your eyelid very

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.080 
but it does neutralize your eyelid very
very<00:01:43.350> nicely<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> could<00:01:44.130> use<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.520> also<00:01:44.729> as

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
very nicely so you could use it also as

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
very nicely so you could use it also as
an<00:01:45.240> eyeshadow<00:01:45.420> base<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> show

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310

don't know if you can see the difference

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.520

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
Milani the pixie one is definitely more

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.390 
Milani the pixie one is definitely more
pearly<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.400> those<00:02:26.640> are<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:28.020> very<00:02:28.650> similar<00:02:29.070> I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
pearly so those are very very similar I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.060 
pearly so those are very very similar I
have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.910> say<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.600> even<00:02:31.500> though<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.740> pixie

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
have to say that even though the pixie

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.040 
have to say that even though the pixie
one's<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.370> little<00:02:32.460> bit<00:02:32.730> more<00:02:32.760> pearly<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> kind<00:02:33.870> of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
one's a little bit more pearly I kind of

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.350 
one's a little bit more pearly I kind of
like<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.650> Milani<00:02:35.100> highlight<00:02:35.820> one<00:02:36.060> better

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
like the Milani highlight one better

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.820 
like the Milani highlight one better
because<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.440> not<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.810> pearly<00:02:39.810> shimmery<00:02:40.470> I

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
because it's not so pearly shimmery I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.370 
because it's not so pearly shimmery I
noticed<00:02:41.820> with<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.090> pixie<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.170> looks

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
noticed with the pixie one that it looks

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.660 
noticed with the pixie one that it looks
good<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.770> real<00:02:43.920> life<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.220> when<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> take

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
good in real life but when I take

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.450 
good in real life but when I take
pictures<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.780> almost<00:02:46.020> looks<00:02:46.440> too<00:02:46.500> white<00:02:47.130> if

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
pictures it almost looks too white if

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.560 
pictures it almost looks too white if
that<00:02:47.670> makes<00:02:47.880> any<00:02:48.030> sense

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
that makes any sense

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.960 
that makes any sense
whereas<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.680> Milani<00:02:50.040> one<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.550> gives<00:02:50.790> a

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
whereas the Milani one just gives a

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.870 
whereas the Milani one just gives a
really<00:02:51.000> nice<00:02:51.690> open<00:02:52.560> bright<00:02:53.040> eyed<00:02:53.310> look<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.760> I

can't really tell it just kind of opens
up<00:02:57.840> your<00:02:57.960> eyes<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> little<00:02:58.440> bit

eyebrows<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.000> don't<00:03:45.390> know<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.630> I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.050 
eyebrows with now I don't know if I
personally<00:03:46.709> would<00:03:46.890> draw<00:03:47.100> my<00:03:47.340> eyebrows<00:03:47.820> with

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
personally would draw my eyebrows with

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.640 
personally would draw my eyebrows with
this<00:03:48.239> because<00:03:48.360> it's<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.660> little<00:03:48.810> bit<00:03:49.080> too

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
this because it's a little bit too

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.710 
this because it's a little bit too
creamy<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.550> I<00:03:50.880> don't<00:03:50.940> really<00:03:51.239> want<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.600> look

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
creamy and I don't really want to look

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.460 
creamy and I don't really want to look
like<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.989> anw<00:03:52.650> bear<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.930> for<00:03:54.930> those<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.140> you

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
like the anw bear but for those of you

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.979 
like the anw bear but for those of you
who<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:56.070> thicker<00:03:57.060> eyebrows<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.900> you

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
who have thicker eyebrows and you

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.470 
who have thicker eyebrows and you
actually<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.769> hair<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.550> can<00:03:59.820> stick<00:04:00.209> on

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
actually have hair that it can stick on

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.630 
actually have hair that it can stick on
to<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.110> could<00:04:01.590> see<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.920> cream<00:04:02.220> working

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
to you I could see the cream working

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.400 
to you I could see the cream working
really<00:04:02.820> well<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.209> because<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.630> have<00:04:04.050> such

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
really well but because I have such

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.890 
really well but because I have such
little<00:04:05.160> hair<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.700> would<00:04:05.790> go<00:04:05.970> directly<00:04:06.360> onto<00:04:06.750> my

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
little hair it would go directly onto my

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.690 
little hair it would go directly onto my
skin<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:08.010> think<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.310> would<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.519> little

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
skin and I think it would be a little

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.660 
skin and I think it would be a little
bit<00:04:08.940> too<00:04:09.150> creamy<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:10.590> also<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.310> would<00:04:11.459> just

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
bit too creamy and also it would just

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.850 
bit too creamy and also it would just
kind<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.000> smudge<00:04:12.360> off<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:12.870> if<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.200> have<00:04:13.440> hair

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
kind of smudge off so if you have hair

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.490 
kind of smudge off so if you have hair
the<00:04:14.610> top<00:04:14.880> side<00:04:15.150> might<00:04:15.450> work<00:04:15.630> better<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
the top side might work better the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.770 
the top side might work better the
highlights<00:04:16.980> side<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.580> it<00:04:17.730> definitely<00:04:18.540> like<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
highlights side of it definitely like a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.020 
highlights side of it definitely like a
concealer<00:04:19.260> for<00:04:19.560> under<00:04:19.890> your<00:04:20.040> eyebrows<00:04:20.459> which

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
concealer for under your eyebrows which

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.880 
concealer for under your eyebrows which
I<00:04:21.239> really<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:21.840> because<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.320> just<00:04:22.500> makes<00:04:22.710> your

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
I really like because it just makes your

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.070 
I really like because it just makes your
eyebrows<00:04:23.340> look<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:23.789> much<00:04:23.970> more<00:04:24.030> crisp<00:04:24.720> and

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
eyebrows look so much more crisp and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.730 
eyebrows look so much more crisp and
well<00:04:25.800> drawn

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
well drawn

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.159 
well drawn

and taint and it's basically like a
mascara<00:04:36.639> wand<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.270> then<00:04:37.569> they<00:04:37.690> also<00:04:38.039> came<00:04:39.039> out

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
form as well and again this wax would

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.939 
form as well and again this wax would
work<00:04:46.300> better<00:04:46.569> with<00:04:46.870> someone<00:04:47.080> with<00:04:47.440> thicker

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
the under eye but all the ones that I

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.149 
the under eye but all the ones that I
saw<00:05:33.729> before<00:05:34.000> were<00:05:34.389> more<00:05:34.630> higher-end<00:05:35.349> so<00:05:36.039> I'm

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
saw before were more higher-end so I'm

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.770 
saw before were more higher-end so I'm
really<00:05:36.490> glad<00:05:36.639> that<00:05:36.759> they<00:05:37.030> came<00:05:37.240> up<00:05:37.300> with<00:05:37.479> these

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
really glad that they came up with these

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.480 
really glad that they came up with these
because<00:05:38.110> then<00:05:38.259> there's<00:05:38.440> kind<00:05:38.680> of<00:05:38.770> an<00:05:38.919> option

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
because then there's kind of an option

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.570 
because then there's kind of an option
for<00:05:39.820> drugstore<00:05:40.539> and<00:05:40.750> not<00:05:41.320> as<00:05:41.470> expensive<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.310> I

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
for drugstore and not as expensive and I

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.399 
for drugstore and not as expensive and I
personally<00:05:43.030> think<00:05:43.210> that<00:05:43.449> the<00:05:43.659> quality<00:05:44.229> is

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
personally think that the quality is

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.499 
personally think that the quality is
just<00:05:44.710> as<00:05:44.919> good<00:05:45.130> as<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.580> more<00:05:45.759> expensive<00:05:45.789> one

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
just as good as the more expensive one

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.420 
just as good as the more expensive one
so<00:05:46.750> anyways<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.259> hope<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:47.830> was<00:05:47.979> helpful<00:05:48.009> and

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
so anyways I hope that was helpful and

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.419
