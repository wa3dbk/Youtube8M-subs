00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.740
 Mexico one of the five countries with the highest 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.740
 biological diversity of the world 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.889
 observe 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.730
 listen out 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.580
 and nothing 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 immerse yourself 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.940
 now explore the textures to your 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.550
 around 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 feel nature in your hands 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 your difference 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.800
 your wealth 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.800
 its immensity 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.379
 we are made of the same atoms 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.030
 we are the same 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.060
 we are nature 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.810
 Mexican nature provides us 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.810
 Water 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.950
 oxygen 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.950
 food drinks and divisions 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.260
 the deterioration of ecosystems and the loss 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.970
 of animals plants and genes are 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.630
 consequence of our lifestyle 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 hunting the species traffic and the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.110
 Excessive fishing threatens populations 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.110
 of the nature 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.350
 during the past 50 years we have 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.220
 lost important species like the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.500
 Mexican wolf 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.510
 many of the materials that we use 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.510
 pollute soils and seas 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.780
 we have transformed more than 50% of the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.780
 territory 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.490
 overgrazing erodes soils and 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.709
 Livestock emits more gases of effect 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.850
 greenhouse that all means of 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.850
 transport together 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.060
 for the first time human activity is 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.950
 accelerating the warming of the earth 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.950
 and threatening our existence 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.040
 the natural protected areas 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.760
 help to mitigate the change 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 climate 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.390
 they are a shield against erosion 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.390
 hurricanes and tsunamis 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.810
 they are water sponges 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.989
 contribute to the protection of species 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.989
 priority 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.040
 involve and benefit all 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.040
 social actors 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.020
 what can you do 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.610
 knows the Mexican nature and respects 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.680
 to plants and animals 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.650
 participates with organizations of 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 conservation 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:13.010
 consumes and produces responsibly 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 reduces rejects and recycles complaints 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.370
 activities that deteriorate the environment 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.959
 conserving the environment is 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.959
 everyone's responsibility
