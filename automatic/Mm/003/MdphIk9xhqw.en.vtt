00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
again this time making a loop that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.810 
again this time making a loop that
you'll<00:00:59.910> later<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.579> long

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the short end just hang down and you're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.830 
the short end just hang down and you're
holding<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.830> nos<00:01:08.040> toe<00:01:08.510> you're<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> take

holding the nos toe you're going to take

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.890 
holding the nos toe you're going to take
the<00:01:10.170> long<00:01:10.380> end<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.570> feed<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.780> through<00:01:14.900> this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the long end and feed it through this

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.380 
the long end and feed it through this
right<00:01:16.200> here

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.530 

so<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.610> okay<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.820> then
