00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.360
 good day dear football friends good 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.960
 day dear reader 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.670
 good day dear saz tv spectators too 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.920
 today we welcome you back two 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.840
 hours before the last group match the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.900
 german national team against the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.300
 usa here on the farm of wife dr 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.529
 evening near the danish border 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.890
 and we focus entirely on that 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:36.239
 last game a draw is enough yes 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.399
 against the usa nasa is like the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.559
 own previous group games 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.070
 hopefully the right one again 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.750
 game outcome predict it later 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.690
 today I extend a warm welcome 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.449
 bernd wehmeyer the club manager of the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 hamburger sv the hsv trains only 20 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.620
 kilometers away from animal in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 Glücksburg is preparing for the new one 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.210
 season ago it fits that bernd 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.660
 wehmeyer came over here for a moment 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 wehmeyer how do you judge them so far 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.140
 wm yes I think we have one so far 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.119
 great wm seen with great play with 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 a very good german team 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 an outstanding opener one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.259
 play against ghana what quite in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 Order was with a result where you 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.560
 So I've always seen a four gates 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.659
 we think we can not yet 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.970
 lament and, of course, are happy now 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.920
 on the last group game and I go 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.030
 Assume that we will then, of course 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.329
 also move into the 8th 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.890
 probably as a group first 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.780
 bremer they have with the early 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.720
 leave the Englishman the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.390
 Spanier and the Italian counted but 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.290
 I really could not think so 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.610
 football experts reckon that three such 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.850
 high caliber already in the group stage 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.290
 on the track remain mostly yes so 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.759
 any dervish it over and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.020
 There are always surprises as well 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.869
 in one direction and the other 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 but now three such strong ones 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.040
 Switch off football nations at once 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.619
 That's a bit different 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.380
 special and so no one really has 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.300
 expected 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 It makes the German way easier 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.240
 to the endgame yes as I think we have 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.610
 us traditionally against the italians 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.110
 always done hard against spain last 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.690
 It was not easy 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.180
 from that point of view one could of course 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.890
 think that is maybe on the way 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.110
 to the title that's something 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.640
 I think that's not going to get any easier 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.290
 because there are other nations in it 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 to enter the foreground 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.640
 best example believing costa rica die 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.030
 so far a great wm have played so 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.570
 The South Americans already seem very 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.210
 to be strong and I think so 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.370
 not so easy for us 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.870
 Today is a photographer of the German 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.930
 press agency if so, hopefully 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.530
 hit the right gate and see it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.650
 they love spectators our wm oracle 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.480
 takes nationwide shape so now 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.350
 Let's take a look at the shot of 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.350
 nazar on 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.940
 Well bernd wehmeyer nasa has ins 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.610
 American gate hit and that we 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.410
 would have said earlier one would have a piece 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.900
 to throw bread behind the ball 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.820
 So just gone over the line 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.950
 that can be a 1 1 turn on the cameras 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.500
 mean but we must 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.290
 torkamera again we recommend pulling 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.890
 maybe not a clear announcement 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.670
 he so it looks like the ball 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.530
 What is a short victory in the name of 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.730
 Germans think that's realistic 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.830
 I think that is realistic 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.400
 if we already have a two here 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.170
 ask to the hsv bernd wehmeyer it 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.220
 was a heavy season the old season 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.620
 We also want that as fast as possible 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.220
 forget what do you think the new one 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.440
 season 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.980
 Of course I hope you too 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.850
 Much better than that 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.530
 past and there I am actually 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.470
 also pretty sure we have yes 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.419
 this time a very long preparation of the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.260
 trainer works very hard with the 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.570
 Team up here in Glücksburg and 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.030
 so I think we're in good shape 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.790
 the new season will go and then 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.700
 also from the beginning on a better role 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.919
 Play as last year, so great and 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.460

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:02.390
