to the right now as you do the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.299 
to the right now as you do the
swashplate<00:00:35.910> should<00:00:36.450> tilt<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.960> left<00:00:37.309> or

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
swashplate should tilt to the left or

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.180 
swashplate should tilt to the left or
try<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> stay<00:00:39.270> level<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.920> behavior

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
try to stay level this is the behavior

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.330 
try to stay level this is the behavior
we<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> see

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.910 

go<00:00:52.970> ahead<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.330> do<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.600> same<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.230> elevator

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
go ahead and do the same on the elevator

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.479 
go ahead and do the same on the elevator
tilt<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.310> nose<00:00:55.490> down<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.750> swashplate<00:00:57.489> should

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
tilt the nose down the swashplate should

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:07.000 
tilt the nose down the swashplate should
tilt<00:00:58.790> back<00:01:00.430> if<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.700> behaves<00:01:02.180> like<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:06.010> we

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
tilt back if it behaves like this we

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.690 
tilt back if it behaves like this we
need<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.370> flick<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.510> rudder<00:01:08.720> stick<00:01:09.700> you've

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
need to flick the rudder stick you've

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.570 
need to flick the rudder stick you've
only<00:01:10.880> got<00:01:11.090> four<00:01:11.330> choices<00:01:12.250> one<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.369> them<00:01:13.490> is

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
only got four choices one of them is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.640 
only got four choices one of them is
gonna<00:01:13.729> be<00:01:13.910> right

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
gonna be right

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.960 
gonna be right
so<00:01:15.650> flick<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.600> check<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.720> again<00:01:18.520> until<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.760> get

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
so flick it check it again until you get

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.280 
so flick it check it again until you get
it<00:01:20.119> right<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:21.790> then<00:01:22.790> double<00:01:23.180> check<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.630> this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
it right and then double check it this

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.180 
it right and then double check it this
is<00:01:24.560> very<00:01:24.950> important<00:01:26.470> go<00:01:27.470> ahead<00:01:27.680> press<00:01:27.979> the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
is very important go ahead press the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.520 
is very important go ahead press the
button<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.850> we'll<00:01:28.970> go<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.180> step<00:01:29.509> in<00:01:29.780> setting

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
button and we'll go to step in setting

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.270 
button and we'll go to step in setting
the<00:01:30.800> pirouette<00:01:31.119> optimization<00:01:32.119> direction

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
the pirouette optimization direction

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.760 
the pirouette optimization direction
when<00:01:34.280> we<00:01:34.310> enter<00:01:34.700> step<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:35.290> one<00:01:36.290> side<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
when we enter step in one side of the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.389 
when we enter step in one side of the
swashplate<00:01:37.100> kicks<00:01:37.759> up<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:39.740> want<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.009> keep<00:01:40.190> our

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
swashplate kicks up you want to keep our

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.550 
swashplate kicks up you want to keep our
eye<00:01:40.430> on<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:41.030> high<00:01:41.210> side<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.869> swashplate

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
eye on the high side of the swashplate

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.050 
eye on the high side of the swashplate
and<00:01:43.180> rotate<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.390> helicopter<00:01:45.250> as<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:46.580> rotate

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and rotate the helicopter as we rotate

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.840 
and rotate the helicopter as we rotate
it<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:48.500> should<00:01:48.710> still<00:01:49.070> be<00:01:49.250> looking<00:01:49.580> at<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
it we should still be looking at the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.700 
it we should still be looking at the
high<00:01:50.090> side<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.899> swashplate<00:01:51.850> if<00:01:52.850> not<00:01:53.710> flick

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
high side of the swashplate if not flick

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.200 
high side of the swashplate if not flick
the<00:01:54.860> rudder<00:01:55.070> stick

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.520 

and<00:01:58.299> then<00:01:58.990> double<00:01:59.409> check<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.200> what<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and then double check this is what it

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.560 
and then double check this is what it
should<00:02:02.740> look<00:02:02.770> like<00:02:04.470> once<00:02:05.470> we're<00:02:05.710> finished<00:02:06.570> you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
should look like once we're finished you

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
should look like once we're finished you
can<00:02:07.750> step<00:02:08.080> out<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.530> menu<00:02:08.770> power<00:02:09.550> off<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
can step out of the menu power off and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.320 
can step out of the menu power off and
we'll<00:02:11.890> check<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> few<00:02:12.280> things<00:02:12.490> before<00:02:13.180> our

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
we'll check a few things before our

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.990 
we'll check a few things before our
first<00:02:13.569> flight
