00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
uses like don't do it Pegasus but of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
uses like don't do it Pegasus but of
course<00:00:40.950> Pegasus<00:00:41.340> does<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.660> he<00:00:42.780> comes<00:00:42.960> out

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and then like his suspended human form

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.869 
and then like his suspended human form
it's<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.680> reawaken<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> guess<00:00:47.489> smelling

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it's like reawaken so I guess smelling

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
it's like reawaken so I guess smelling
it<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.210> uses<00:00:48.510> power<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.079> something

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
like tender moment that no Helena just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
like tender moment that no Helena just
rips<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.670> apart<00:00:53.699> because<00:00:54.120> did<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.539> really

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
think that was kind of last until the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.430 
think that was kind of last until the
soldiers<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.449> fighting<00:00:57.539> against<00:00:57.870> zirconia

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
soldiers are fighting against zirconia

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.810 
soldiers are fighting against zirconia
and<00:00:58.770> they're<00:00:59.039> actually<00:00:59.160> doing<00:00:59.340> pretty<00:00:59.730> well

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and they're actually doing pretty well

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
and they're actually doing pretty well

like they're kind of kicking her ass and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460 
like they're kind of kicking her ass and
then<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> Amazon<00:01:03.210> core<00:01:03.420> tech<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
then the Amazon core tech like kind of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
then the Amazon core tech like kind of
see<00:01:04.559> what's<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.430> zirconia<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.330> able

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
see what's going on and zirconia is able

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
see what's going on and zirconia is able
to<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.750> draw<00:01:07.049> power<00:01:07.290> from<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.010> they

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to like draw power from them like they

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.500 
to like draw power from them like they
have<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.549> their<00:01:08.760> orbs<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.150> give<00:01:09.360> them

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
have like their orbs that give them

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
have like their orbs that give them
power<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> he's<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.350> extracting<00:01:10.950> their<00:01:11.100> own

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
power and he's like extracting their own

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
power and he's like extracting their own
energy<00:01:11.400> from<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> mercury<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.010> like

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
energy from it and so mercury is like

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.969 
energy from it and so mercury is like
you<00:01:14.310> guys<00:01:14.430> obviously<00:01:15.500> zirconia<00:01:16.500> has<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> spell

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
you guys obviously zirconia has a spell

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.499 
you guys obviously zirconia has a spell
on<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.909> want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> break<00:01:18.479> free

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
on you like if you want to break free

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.570 
on you like if you want to break free
from<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> need<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> break<00:01:19.439> those<00:01:19.590> orbs<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
from it you need to break those orbs the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.219 
from it you need to break those orbs the
cortex<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.060> no<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.600> break<00:01:21.810> these<00:01:21.960> will

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
cortex like no if we break these will

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
cortex like no if we break these will
grow<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.890> won't<00:01:23.040> stay<00:01:23.340> young<00:01:23.490> forever<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
grow up we won't stay young forever and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330
