great job this year change engines from

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.179 
great job this year change engines from
carburation<00:01:01.869> to<00:01:02.140> fuel<00:01:02.379> injection<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.070> got

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189 
carburation to fuel injection it's got

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:05.279 
carburation to fuel injection it's got
six<00:01:03.489> more<00:01:03.670> horse<00:01:03.969> quite<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:04.839> bit<00:01:05.049> forward

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
six more horse quite a bit forward

six more horse quite a bit forward
torque<00:01:05.679> when<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:06.070> was<00:01:06.250> writing<00:01:06.460> I<00:01:06.580> can<00:01:06.729> feel<00:01:06.880> the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
torque when I was writing I can feel the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.370 
torque when I was writing I can feel the
Turk<00:01:07.179> difference<00:01:07.509> right<00:01:07.689> away<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.960> feels<00:01:08.110> like

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
Turk difference right away it feels like

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.139 
Turk difference right away it feels like
a<00:01:08.530> completely<00:01:08.950> different<00:01:09.070> engine<00:01:09.640> actually

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
a completely different engine actually

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.050 
a completely different engine actually
it's<00:01:10.270> still<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.539> Genesis<00:01:11.069> 1049<00:01:12.069> three

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
it's still the Genesis 1049 three

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.300 
it's still the Genesis 1049 three
cylinder<00:01:13.539> four-stroke<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.799> bottom<00:01:15.220> and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
cylinder four-stroke the bottom and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.070 
cylinder four-stroke the bottom and
Horace<00:01:15.610> better<00:01:15.819> has<00:01:16.000> better<00:01:16.299> actual<00:01:16.869> delivery

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
Horace better has better actual delivery

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.930 
Horace better has better actual delivery
from<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.530> bottom<00:01:17.920> end<00:01:18.069> all<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.549> way<00:01:18.640> through

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
from the bottom end all the way through

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.880 
from the bottom end all the way through
it's<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.149> better<00:01:19.330> transition<00:01:19.869> meaning<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.500> it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
it's a better transition meaning that it

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.399 
it's a better transition meaning that it
built<00:01:21.640> power<00:01:21.880> equally<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.630> linear<00:01:22.869> swappable

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
built power equally in linear swappable

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.469 
built power equally in linear swappable
carbon<00:01:23.950> better<00:01:24.399> than<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> carburetor<00:01:25.179> I

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
carbon better than the carburetor I

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.070 
carbon better than the carburetor I
really<00:01:26.080> like<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.520> vector<00:01:27.850> lcx<00:01:28.270> cutie<00:01:28.810> is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
really like it the vector lcx cutie is

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.559 
really like it the vector lcx cutie is
now<00:01:29.500> fuel-injected<00:01:30.310> whereas<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.179> used<00:01:31.209> to<00:01:31.450> be

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
now fuel-injected whereas it used to be

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:32.940 
now fuel-injected whereas it used to be
carbureted<00:01:32.049> in<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.200> past<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.709> when<00:01:32.830> they

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
carbureted in the past and when they

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.199 
carbureted in the past and when they
switch<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.459> they<00:01:33.640> lost<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.940> couple<00:01:34.090> pounds

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
switch to that they lost a couple pounds

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.440 
switch to that they lost a couple pounds
and<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:35.020> notice<00:01:35.319> that<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.619> front<00:01:35.860> end

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and you notice that in the front end

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.320 
and you notice that in the front end
it's<00:01:37.450> very<00:01:37.780> well<00:01:38.289> balanced<00:01:38.979> but<00:01:39.490> feel<00:01:40.000> doesn't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
it's very well balanced but feel doesn't

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.509 
it's very well balanced but feel doesn't
feel<00:01:40.689> really<00:01:41.200> heavy<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.739> front<00:01:41.950> or<00:01:42.220> things

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:42.519 
feel really heavy in the front or things

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.130 
feel really heavy in the front or things
like<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.700> it's<00:01:42.970> got<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.119> great<00:01:43.330> distribution

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
like that it's got a great distribution

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.990 
like that it's got a great distribution
of<00:01:44.229> weight<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:45.340> know<00:01:45.580> that<00:01:45.789> there's<00:01:45.940> that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
of weight I know that there's that

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.940 
of weight I know that there's that
misconception<00:01:46.599> that<00:01:46.810> all<00:01:46.959> four<00:01:47.170> strokes<00:01:47.470> feel

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
misconception that all four strokes feel

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.770 
misconception that all four strokes feel
so<00:01:48.129> heavy<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.550> don't<00:01:48.849> find<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.360> bacterial

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
so heavy I don't find that the bacterial

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.279 
so heavy I don't find that the bacterial
TX<00:01:50.050> GT<00:01:50.410> does<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:51.280> find<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:51.849> I<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.629> control<00:01:53.110> of

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
TX GT does I find that I have control of

anything that I can really say that I
don't<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.840> about<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.850> they've<00:02:29.850> gone

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000

in<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.270> i<00:02:30.300> recalibrated<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.320> front

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
in and i recalibrated the front

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.490 
in and i recalibrated the front
suspension<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.880> has<00:02:33.510> made<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.930> world<00:02:33.960> of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
suspension and that has made a world of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.070 
suspension and that has made a world of
a<00:02:34.560> difference<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.460> LT<00:02:35.820> XGC<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.630> very

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
a difference the LT XGC is very

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.740 
a difference the LT XGC is very
comfortable<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.740> ride<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:39.030> easy<00:02:39.570> to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
comfortable to ride it is easy to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.350 
comfortable to ride it is easy to
transition<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.650> corner<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.340> if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.060> have

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
transition in the corner so if you have

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.150 
transition in the corner so if you have
your<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.350> tight<00:02:43.530> turns<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.010> things

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
your are and the tight turns and things

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.920 
your are and the tight turns and things
like<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.640> very<00:02:44.880> easy<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.390> slide<00:02:45.720> from

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
like that it's very easy to slide from

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.750 
like that it's very easy to slide from
the<00:02:46.020> left<00:02:46.200> side<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:46.710> side<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.310> also

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the left side to the right side and also

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.520 
the left side to the right side and also
the<00:02:48.360> transition<00:02:48.930> from<00:02:49.050> sitting<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.500> standing

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the transition from sitting to standing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.780 
the transition from sitting to standing
is<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.940> easy<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:52.380> seat<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.680> very<00:02:53.040> soft<00:02:53.460> and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
is really easy the seat is very soft and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.020 
is really easy the seat is very soft and
I<00:02:54.210> pin<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.960> very<00:02:55.200> comfortable<00:02:55.440> ride

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
I pin that it's a very comfortable ride

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.280 
I pin that it's a very comfortable ride

you know some of the newer seats are a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.130 
you know some of the newer seats are a
little<00:02:58.500> bit<00:02:58.740> stiffer<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.570> the<00:03:00.570> buttons<00:03:01.080> to

putting on a lot of miles 200 some 300

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.210 
putting on a lot of miles 200 some 300
of<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.930> know<00:03:10.020> in<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.230> day<00:03:10.410> you're<00:03:11.040> going<00:03:11.130> to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
of you know in a day you're going to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.100 
of you know in a day you're going to
really<00:03:11.400> want<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> comfortable<00:03:12.780> ride

really want to have a comfortable ride
and<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.470> find<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.010> LT<00:03:14.550> XG<00:03:14.850> team<00:03:15.060> has<00:03:15.390> that

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
and I find that the LT XG team has that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.910 
and I find that the LT XG team has that
the<00:03:16.620> cornering<00:03:17.040> on<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.490> flood<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.920> so

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
the cornering on this flood is is so

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.290 
the cornering on this flood is is so
much<00:03:20.100> different<00:03:20.280> than<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.730> was<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.880> years<00:03:21.240> past

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
much different than it was in years past

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.510 
much different than it was in years past
with<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.170> new<00:03:22.290> recalibration<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> front

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
with the new recalibration in the front

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.140 
with the new recalibration in the front
it's<00:03:24.390> very<00:03:24.690> smooth

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
it's very smooth

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.240 
it's very smooth
and<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.540> didn't<00:03:27.079> notice<00:03:27.290> any<00:03:27.500> darting<00:03:27.980> and

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and I didn't notice any darting and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.649 
and I didn't notice any darting and
things<00:03:28.489> like<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.730> you're<00:03:29.239> really<00:03:29.450> in

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
things like that you're really in

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.679 
things like that you're really in
control<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.049> his<00:03:30.200> life<00:03:30.939> what<00:03:31.939> I<00:03:31.970> really<00:03:32.390> really

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:32.689 
control of his life what I really really

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.910 
control of his life what I really really
like<00:03:32.870> about<00:03:33.019> her<00:03:33.230> coming<00:03:33.349> back<00:03:33.590> into<00:03:33.769> the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
like about her coming back into the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
Corning I was driving the Y 136 that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.619 
Corning I was driving the Y 136 that
makes<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.700> big<00:03:37.849> difference<00:03:37.879> coming<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.540> the

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
makes a big difference coming in the

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.270 
makes a big difference coming in the
corners<00:03:39.019> we're<00:03:39.230> getting<00:03:39.439> some<00:03:39.620> icy<00:03:39.829> build<00:03:40.189> up

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
corners we're getting some icy build up

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.610 
corners we're getting some icy build up
into<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.549> corners<00:03:41.049> having<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.110> longer<00:03:42.409> track

into the corners having a longer track

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.679 
into the corners having a longer track
made<00:03:42.920> up<00:03:43.069> much<00:03:43.400> much<00:03:43.790> bigger<00:03:44.209> difference

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
made up much much bigger difference
