what I love about this curling iron is

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.280 
what I love about this curling iron is
it<00:04:56.470> heats<00:04:57.160> up<00:04:57.430> very<00:04:57.790> fast<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.540> saves<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.110> lot<00:04:59.230> of

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
it heats up very fast so saves a lot of

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.680 
it heats up very fast so saves a lot of
time<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.890> it's<00:05:00.490> not<00:05:00.760> too<00:05:00.970> heavy<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.660> it

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
time and it's not too heavy so it

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.340 
time and it's not too heavy so it
doesn't<00:05:02.350> make<00:05:02.470> my<00:05:02.710> hand<00:05:03.520> relief<00:05:04.000> pain<00:05:04.350> it's

easier<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:05.980> hold<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.690> also<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.900> like<00:05:08.530> it

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
easier to hold and also I like it

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.040 
easier to hold and also I like it
because<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.670> doesn't<00:05:10.030> make<00:05:10.180> my<00:05:10.330> hair<00:05:10.540> dry<00:05:10.810> a
