00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
 he is an adventurer that I like to move around the world 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.770
 travel on the flight of 102 kuramoto gerona de eta and pilot na 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.430
 to do scuba diving 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.190
 general jare phobia and within 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.979
 all the facets that I like to do what I like to know 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.739
 Well, mountain climbing is the most important part of Canada 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.869
 I still can not believe it worse 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.489
 but it has been a fantastic thing throughout the day and not 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.420
 stay 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.170
 after lottery you do not have a passion that is the mountain you dedicate to 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.910
 them my life changed from it 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.980
 Suddenly the television was done making programs to tarnish but 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.840
 but programs a little different not the typical program of the superman bogota 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.650
 January 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.200
 I personally like to be loved 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.250
 and above all it is important to tell things 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.970
 salt and how citizen happen to symbian ar without altering what is the real essence 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.950
 does not have what happened 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 I think that he liked it, and above all 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.430
 the communication campaign olé approach to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.130
 Argentinian in the public 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.980
 I think that those French people who are the mostros did not take many years to 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.980
 in front of 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.990
 and this is due the third national report to mountain between the idea is 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.970
 that it does not know the people the town is not only to him because also 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.390
 there are other sports 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.640
 and those opus sports have a great time 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.260
 that are fun that are not as dangerous as they are painted 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.410
 that the mountain foresees the tragedy and we who is precisely the last 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.680
 what we have 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.910
 and that it's about having fun healthy and good life 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.120
 take care a little 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.330
 meanwhile I believe that the essence of the program is the curious thing of all that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.340
 tell it 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 told how things are a lot 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.229
 oberá first reason for media power is because as a single 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.020
 machine is an ordinary guy and I could already feel and that ravaged haiti if 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 I would be a name for alpinism 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.470
 jose Vicente today falling from a normal guy on the street 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.040
 that he dedicates himself to doing things and that sometimes nothing comes his way and that his 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.770
 backwards with oxy that no but that I told them not 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.010
 tirana berber 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.910
 well in cut ladies and the overcrowding and the doors and what 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.670
 it happens there 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.209
 we really like to always tell the truth 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.419
 and in what way 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.549
 normal human beings and that you unanimously on Thursday then considerable regarding 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.260
 other climbers apizaco then in Latin and omoa ser juanito or what would be alex 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.009
 txikon kagayama tomatito 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.299
 yes we are 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.260
 other sex moseley great sector of the great public different to the most active 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.289
 good ones 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:33.399
 tucumanos sometimes a bit the peace the program that if we have your cousin what 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.160
 that I'm afraid of the laughter 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.889
 what we think and above all well 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.139
 for me the most important travelers 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.689
 the deal with people knows the madness of the people we meet 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.249
 mountaineers want a mystical touch these leave cookie me what 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.889
 I have there we are I think quite lonely we all look like a little 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.349
 the purity of things and the promotion word of ethics 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.249
 but there is something that for example I do not like that is more emea requests for 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.069
 prohibit what the union would lack 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.439
 It made life quite anarchic and I respect a lot what freedom is. 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.359
 freedom to do what we want 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.769
 yes, no 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.159
 important is not to say we have placed a documentary 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.239
 in a puncture in 30 packaging and do not know is the best time 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.679
 of television the best day on a Friday 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.919
 and we have also managed to place ourselves 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.619
 in some of the programs as the most watched program in the chain that 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:20.259
 day 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.519
 that's fantastic a documentary has done that 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.839
 it's something that you have to go back to be there is no free there's a precedent 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.269
 I think it's the beauty of all this that we have achieved with our sport 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.439
 that we love 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.629
 place the public and the improvement and that shows us that there is 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.619
 other ways of the programs and another way of telling it 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.409
 and become a hit and a province without success 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.089
 they do not express themselves in theo 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.499
 it's a top ten text 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.999
 no less innocent of the charge the world of adventure and especially the 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:49.829
 Montana 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.139
 to the public and above all have compassion that they give me a little 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.879
 our activity because this could not and half imagines that having a 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.449
 budget and as last we are only two 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.669
 and we have a budget we have it clear we can do almost almost everything 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.619
 what we want 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.619
 Ana 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.639
 in baleares in av 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.099
 if you are 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.499
 these situations
