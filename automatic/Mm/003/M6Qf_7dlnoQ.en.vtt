00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
background area and I'm going to glue

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.910 
background area and I'm going to glue
them<00:00:31.060> together<00:00:31.179> and<00:00:31.570> then<00:00:32.500> we're<00:00:32.649> going<00:00:32.800> to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
them together and then we're going to

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.229 
them together and then we're going to
attach<00:00:33.070> them<00:00:33.550> to<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.960> binder<00:00:35.800> itself<00:00:36.399> so

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
attach them to the binder itself so

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.700 
attach them to the binder itself so
first<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.660> all<00:00:37.750> what<00:00:38.020> we're<00:00:38.140> going<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.289> do<00:00:38.469> is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
first of all what we're going to do is

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.420 
first of all what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:39.160> going<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.989> attach<00:00:40.989> these<00:00:41.829> two<00:00:42.160> pieces

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
we're going to attach these two pieces

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:50.580 
we're going to attach these two pieces
of<00:00:42.640> paper<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.270> one<00:00:43.480> another<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.500> do

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
of paper to one another and get to do

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.500 
of paper to one another and get to do
that<00:00:50.710> with<00:00:50.770> hot<00:00:51.070> glue<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:54.090> I'm<00:00:55.090> going<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.329> try

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
that with hot glue so I'm going to try

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.540 
that with hot glue so I'm going to try
to<00:00:55.539> line<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:55.840> up<00:00:56.050> as<00:00:56.260> good<00:00:56.440> as<00:00:56.890> possible<00:00:59.550> before

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
to line it up as good as possible before

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.170 
to line it up as good as possible before
putting<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.090> down<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:01.750> locking<00:01:02.199> in<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.410> glue

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
putting it down and locking in the glue

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.690 
putting it down and locking in the glue
perfect<00:01:04.180> and<00:01:04.510> now<00:01:05.260> what<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.680> can<00:01:05.860> do<00:01:06.010> is<00:01:06.310> take

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
perfect and now what you can do is take

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.200 
perfect and now what you can do is take
a<00:01:06.940> smaller<00:01:07.390> piece<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:08.050> like<00:01:08.770> white<00:01:09.460> paper<00:01:09.790> or

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
a smaller piece of like white paper or

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.420 
a smaller piece of like white paper or
an<00:01:10.480> index<00:01:10.900> card<00:01:11.200> would<00:01:11.440> work<00:01:11.620> perfectly<00:01:12.130> for

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
an index card would work perfectly for

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.050 
an index card would work perfectly for
this<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:14.650> to<00:01:14.800> attach<00:01:15.160> that<00:01:15.430> here<00:01:15.850> so

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
this and going to attach that here so

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.500 
this and going to attach that here so
that<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:16.300> have<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.480> subject<00:01:16.840> label<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.360> that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
that you have a subject label so that

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:29.670 
that you have a subject label so that
you<00:01:19.600> know<00:01:19.720> what<00:01:19.870> this<00:01:20.020> binder<00:01:20.380> is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.230

write on it right now while it's still

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.830 
write on it right now while it's still
out<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.760> binder<00:01:34.150> because<00:01:34.480> what<00:01:34.630> comes

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
out of the binder because what comes

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.610 
out of the binder because what comes
next<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.410> we<00:01:35.980> are<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.430> attach<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.840> now

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
next is we are going to attach it so now

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.460 

just<00:02:04.450> run<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.690> thin<00:02:05.410> stream<00:02:05.979> of<00:02:06.090> hot<00:02:07.090> glue<00:02:07.470> all

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
just run a thin stream of hot glue all

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.120 
just run a thin stream of hot glue all
along<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.280> binder<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.770> should<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.100> a

little cooler by the time it's time for

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.940 
little cooler by the time it's time for
us<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.040> line<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.700> up<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.970> press<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.739> try<00:02:20.920> to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
line it up as closely as you can before

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.570 
line it up as closely as you can before
pushing<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.320> down<00:02:23.530> because<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.890> get<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> little

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
pushing it down because you get a little

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.240 
pushing it down because you get a little

bit of leeway to move it around but not

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.550 
bit of leeway to move it around but not
much<00:02:31.350> all<00:02:32.350> right
