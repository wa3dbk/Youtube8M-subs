but<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.080> partly<00:02:26.319> why<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.830> such<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> good

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
but just partly why it's such a good

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.530 
but just partly why it's such a good
little<00:02:28.000> rally<00:02:28.270> car<00:02:32.550> then<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.819> next<00:02:34.120> step<00:02:34.330> is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
little rally car then the next step is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.630 
little rally car then the next step is
to<00:02:34.780> put<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.960> cage<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.830> we<00:02:35.950> put<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> roll<00:02:36.460> bar

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
to put a cage in it so we put a roll bar

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.610 
to put a cage in it so we put a roll bar
in<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.150> case<00:02:37.180> something<00:02:38.140> bad<00:02:38.290> ever

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
in it in case something bad ever

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.980 
in it in case something bad ever
happened<00:02:39.069> you<00:02:39.190> would<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.520> well<00:02:39.730> protected

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.200 

it<00:02:44.990> sent<00:02:45.230> me<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.350> file<00:02:45.620> with<00:02:46.010> some<00:02:46.370> photos<00:02:46.880> that

it sent me a file with some photos that

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.110 
it sent me a file with some photos that
you<00:02:47.870> would<00:02:47.990> receive<00:02:48.410> from<00:02:48.560> pro-drive<00:02:49.120> because

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
you would receive from pro-drive because

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.750

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
their 30-year old cars yeah it's good to

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.360 
their 30-year old cars yeah it's good to
build<00:05:31.290> a<00:05:31.470> foundation<00:05:31.830> on<00:05:32.520> a<00:05:32.610> car<00:05:33.210> rather<00:05:33.840> than

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
build a foundation on a car rather than

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.520 
build a foundation on a car rather than
you<00:05:35.370> know<00:05:35.490> go<00:05:35.850> for<00:05:36.150> really<00:05:36.840> high<00:05:37.050> horsepower

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
you know go for really high horsepower

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.190 
you know go for really high horsepower
and<00:05:38.070> unrealistic<00:05:38.669> things<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.660> sort<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:39.990> lose

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
and unrealistic things and sort of lose

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.250 
and unrealistic things and sort of lose
focus<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:41.250> think<00:05:42.000> it<00:05:42.330> getting<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:42.900> safety

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
focus I think it getting the safety

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.219 
focus I think it getting the safety
stuff<00:05:43.530> done<00:05:43.830> and<00:05:44.780> you<00:05:45.780> know<00:05:45.870> decent

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
stuff done and you know decent

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.070 
stuff done and you know decent
suspension<00:05:47.040> I<00:05:47.510> think<00:05:48.510> that's<00:05:48.660> a<00:05:48.780> really<00:05:48.930> good

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
suspension I think that's a really good

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.550 
suspension I think that's a really good
place<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.410> start

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
place to start

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.469

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:11.860 

I'll<00:06:03.990> try<00:06:04.230> harder

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.950 

how<00:06:12.440> to<00:06:12.500> hold<00:06:12.740> up

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960
