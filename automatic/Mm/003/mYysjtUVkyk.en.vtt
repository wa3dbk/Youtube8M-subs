young so 80 pounds is pretty good but

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.990 
young so 80 pounds is pretty good but
it's<00:00:39.840> really<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.200> enough<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.980> who's<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> blame

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it's really not enough so who's to blame

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's really not enough so who's to blame
here<00:00:44.780> right<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.350> thought<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.860> mean<00:00:47.010> 88

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
here right so they thought I mean 88

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880 
here right so they thought I mean 88
feet<00:00:47.760> sounds<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> good<00:00:48.600> length<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.590> her

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
feet sounds like a good length but her

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
feet sounds like a good length but her
her<00:00:50.550> weight<00:00:50.760> loss<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.420> inadequate<00:00:51.840> we

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
her weight loss is really inadequate we

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.529 
her weight loss is really inadequate we
would<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.280> than<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.180> we've

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
would like more than that and so we've

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.510 
would like more than that and so we've
discussed<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.079> little<00:00:55.199> bit<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:56.129> doing<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
discussed a little bit about doing a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
discussed a little bit about doing a
revision<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.719> nice<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
revision and the nice thing about it is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.590 
revision and the nice thing about it is
that<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> revision<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> bad<00:01:00.300> thing

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that we can do a revision the bad thing

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
that we can do a revision the bad thing
is<00:01:00.629> she<00:01:00.899> suffered<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> complication<00:01:01.800> with

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is she suffered a complication with

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880 
is she suffered a complication with
inadequate<00:01:03.090> weight<00:01:03.510> loss<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.199> could<00:01:04.619> kind

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
inadequate weight loss now I could kind

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190 
inadequate weight loss now I could kind
of<00:01:04.949> take<00:01:05.159> some<00:01:05.400> credit<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.760> 80<00:01:06.000> pounds<00:01:06.510> which

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of take some credit for 80 pounds which

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
of take some credit for 80 pounds which
is<00:01:07.229> no<00:01:07.680> pretty<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.540> would<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.900> more

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
is no pretty good but we would like more

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
is no pretty good but we would like more
and<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.890> nice<00:01:11.070> thing<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.790> surgery

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and the nice thing is that the surgery

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
and the nice thing is that the surgery
can<00:01:12.450> allow<00:01:12.960> us<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.500> more<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.369> we

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
can allow us to do more and you know we

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.499 
can allow us to do more and you know we
at<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.939> haven't<00:01:15.150> talked<00:01:15.299> too<00:01:15.479> much

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
at you and I haven't talked too much

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.210 
at you and I haven't talked too much
about<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.740> reasonable<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
about it but I think it's reasonable to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.749 
about it but I think it's reasonable to
consider<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
consider so but I was one of the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
consider so but I was one of the
emotional<00:01:21.330> ones<00:01:21.509> after<00:01:22.020> surgery<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.860> don't

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
emotional ones after surgery I don't

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.320 
emotional ones after surgery I don't
know<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.430> he<00:01:23.549> told<00:01:23.700> them<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.180> actually

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
know if he told them but I actually

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.240 
know if he told them but I actually
threw<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:25.080> stuff<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.320> couple<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.189> nurses<00:01:26.420> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
threw some stuff a couple of nurses I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
threw some stuff a couple of nurses I
was<00:01:29.250> very<00:01:29.460> disoriented<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.479> didn't<00:01:30.720> know

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
was very disoriented and I didn't know

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.040 
was very disoriented and I didn't know
where<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:31.650> whatever
