point<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> main<00:00:58.829> features<00:00:59.250> how<00:00:59.940> does<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
point out the main features how does the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
point out the main features how does the
robot<00:01:00.300> work<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> what's<00:01:01.410> what's<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> gut

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
robot work and and what's what's a gut

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.820 
robot work and and what's what's a gut
on<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.149> these<00:01:03.420> robots<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:04.710> weigh

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
on it right so these robots they weigh

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.850 
on it right so these robots they weigh
about<00:01:04.860> 35<00:01:05.309> pounds<00:01:05.700> better<00:01:06.240> between<00:01:06.680> they<00:01:07.680> go

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
about 35 pounds better between they go

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
about 35 pounds better between they go
down<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.490> tall<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> they<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
down to this tall on they go up to a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.270 
down to this tall on they go up to a
normal<00:01:09.720> eye<00:01:09.960> height<00:01:10.200> okay<00:01:10.770> about<00:01:10.920> six<00:01:10.979> feet

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
normal eye height okay about six feet

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.820 
normal eye height okay about six feet
tall<00:01:11.490> looks<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.880> yeah<00:01:12.000> yeah<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> there's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
tall looks like yeah yeah and so there's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
tall looks like yeah yeah and so there's
a<00:01:13.920> screen<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.060> who's<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a screen on it you can see who's on the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.870 
a screen on it you can see who's on the
other<00:01:15.630> end<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.200> controlling<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> camera

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
other end is controlling it as a camera

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
other end is controlling it as a camera
and<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.299> laser<00:01:18.540> pointer<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> point<00:01:19.530> at

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and a laser pointer so you can point at

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.120 
and a laser pointer so you can point at
things<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> mobile<00:01:22.320> base<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
things and it's got a mobile base that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
things and it's got a mobile base that
lets<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.549> around<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:24.420> three<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> half

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
lets it get around at three and a half

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130 
lets it get around at three and a half
miles<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.650> hour<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.159> normal<00:01:26.880> walking<00:01:27.060> speed<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
miles an hour a normal walking speed so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.630 
miles an hour a normal walking speed so
you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.350> keep<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.710> people<00:01:29.159> walk<00:01:29.340> along

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you can keep up with people walk along

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
you can keep up with people walk along
with<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.540> around<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.229> whole

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
with them and get around a whole

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
with them and get around a whole
building<00:01:31.920> pretty<00:01:32.310> quickly<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> balances

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
building pretty quickly and it balances

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390 
building pretty quickly and it balances
on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:33.990> wheels<00:01:34.200> sort<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> Segway

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
on the two wheels sort of like a Segway

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.910 
on the two wheels sort of like a Segway
it<00:01:35.729> does<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.240> balances<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> means<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it does it balances and that means it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.179 
it does it balances and that means it
can<00:01:38.100> turn<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> dime<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.619> does<00:01:40.619> revolve<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can turn on a dime and does revolve a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.030 
can turn on a dime and does revolve a
rough<00:01:41.340> terrain<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:43.110> idea<00:01:43.380> being<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
rough terrain the idea being just to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.740 
rough terrain the idea being just to
give<00:01:44.220> people<00:01:44.250> more<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.270> sense<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> being

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
give people more of a sense of being

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.749 
give people more of a sense of being
able<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> explore<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> space<00:01:46.740> remotely<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
able to explore the space remotely and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
able to explore the space remotely and
go<00:01:48.119> wherever<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> office<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
go wherever they want in the office and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
go wherever they want in the office and
say<00:01:49.829> hi<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> people<00:01:50.220> right<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.390> like

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
say hi to people right it's like

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.240 
say hi to people right it's like
actually<00:01:51.930> being<00:01:52.110> able<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.439> walk<00:01:52.619> into<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.009> place

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
actually being able to walk into a place
