minifigure or a polybag so we're going

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
minifigure or a polybag so we're going
to<00:00:25.380> open<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.800> thing<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:36.620> see<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:38.420> so

to open this thing up see what we get so
it's<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.320> built<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it's just that I just built this in the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.209 
it's just that I just built this in the
poly<00:00:41.760> bag<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:43.050> another<00:00:43.290> video<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
poly bag I have another video for that I

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.130 
poly bag I have another video for that I
don't<00:00:44.700> even<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.030> thinking<00:00:45.570> build<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.899> without

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
don't even I thinking build this without

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
don't even I thinking build this without
the<00:00:46.289> instructions<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the instructions it's really not that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.319 
the instructions it's really not that
much<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> put<00:00:49.230> these<00:00:50.059> jumper<00:00:51.059> bricks

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
much to it you put these jumper bricks

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.459 
much to it you put these jumper bricks
meet<00:00:51.989> plates<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> 4x6<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.289> go

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
meet plates on the 4x6 you know these go

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.520 
meet plates on the 4x6 you know these go
on<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> wheels<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.160> easy<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:57.530> really

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
on the wheels that's easy to know really

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.450 
on the wheels that's easy to know really
nothing<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
nothing to it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.700 
nothing to it
everything<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.780> set<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.440> built

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
everything about this set can be built

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
everything about this set can be built
pretty<00:01:02.100> much<00:01:02.309> from<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.579> own<00:01:02.699> parts<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.359> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
pretty much from your own parts if you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.020 
pretty much from your own parts if you
have<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:03.930> train<00:01:04.229> wheels<00:01:04.850> actually<00:01:05.850> have

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
have these train wheels actually have

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.500 
have these train wheels actually have
extras<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.750> laying<00:01:06.990> around<00:01:08.420> put<00:01:09.420> them

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
extras of these laying around put them

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.460 
extras of these laying around put them
on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> wheel<00:01:09.810> holder<00:01:11.659> can<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:12.840> parts<00:01:13.260> from

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
on the wheel holder can use parts from

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
on the wheel holder can use parts from
maybe<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:15.049> silver<00:01:16.049> mines<00:01:16.320> shoot<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:17.630> there

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
maybe the silver mines shoot out there

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
maybe the silver mines shoot out there
we<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.930> I'll<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.770> ahead<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.220> alone

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
we go I'll go ahead and do it alone

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.600 
we go I'll go ahead and do it alone
Ranger<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.850> face<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> got<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
mask face and then this piece goes on

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.260 
mask face and then this piece goes on
there<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:34.040> put<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.119> the

there like that you put this in the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.380 
there like that you put this in the
middle<00:01:39.079> in<00:01:40.310> snip<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> your

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
middle in snip it on there and your

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
middle in snip it on there and your
hands<00:01:45.390> go<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.439> hold<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.860> bars<00:01:47.299> just<00:01:48.299> not

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
hands go here to hold the bars just not

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
hands go here to hold the bars just not
a<00:01:48.479> obviously<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.350> an<00:01:49.439> actual<00:01:49.590> working

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
a obviously it's not an actual working

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.080 
a obviously it's not an actual working
pump<00:01:51.000> car<00:01:51.860> would<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.399> amazing<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:54.000> they

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
pump car would be really amazing if they

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
pump car would be really amazing if they
did<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:59.689> it<00:02:00.689> took<00:02:00.840> only<00:02:01.200> about<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> minute<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
did that it took only about a minute to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.929 
did that it took only about a minute to
build<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.409> he's<00:02:04.770> got<00:02:05.009> two<00:02:05.280> guns

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
build it and he's got two guns

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:15.980 
build it and he's got two guns
I<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.270> he's<00:02:06.479> supposed<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.229> one

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.440 

he<00:02:16.990> has<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.290> lean<00:02:17.500> back<00:02:17.770> really<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:19.150> hold<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
he has to lean back really to hold the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.030 
he has to lean back really to hold the
handle<00:02:24.540> Lone<00:02:25.540> Ranger<00:02:25.930> pump<00:02:26.350> car<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.770> these<00:02:26.860> are

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
handle Lone Ranger pump car so these are

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.270 
handle Lone Ranger pump car so these are
the<00:02:27.190> extra<00:02:27.430> parts<00:02:28.800> there<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:33.160> it's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the extra parts there you go so it's

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.890 
the extra parts there you go so it's
pretty<00:02:33.459> cool<00:02:33.700> set<00:02:33.970> I'll<00:02:34.390> just

little pump cars they made one years ago
for<00:02:39.430> Lego<00:02:39.700> trains<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:40.209> had<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> trains<00:02:41.320> video

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
for Lego trains we had the trains video

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.530 
for Lego trains we had the trains video
game<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.940> was<00:02:43.060> cool

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
game that was cool

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.260 
game that was cool
parts<00:02:44.410> are<00:02:44.560> made<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:45.070> Denmark<00:02:45.400> Hungary<00:02:45.910> Mexico

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
parts are made in Denmark Hungary Mexico

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
so you get the good quality Lego molds

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.479 
so you get the good quality Lego molds
let's<00:02:55.660> look<00:02:55.840> at<00:02:55.989> close-up<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.010> minifigure
