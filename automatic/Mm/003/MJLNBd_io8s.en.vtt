00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.470 

so<00:00:18.890> I<00:00:19.100> was<00:00:19.310> born<00:00:19.580> with<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.850> condition<00:00:20.180> called

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
so I was born with a condition called

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.350 
so I was born with a condition called
fibular<00:00:21.230> hem<00:00:21.410> Amelia<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.760> that<00:00:22.940> basically

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
fibular hem Amelia and that basically

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.269 
fibular hem Amelia and that basically
means<00:00:23.630> that<00:00:23.720> I<00:00:23.840> was<00:00:24.050> born<00:00:24.260> with<00:00:24.470> no<00:00:24.500> fibulas

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
means that I was born with no fibulas

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.929 
means that I was born with no fibulas
and<00:00:25.840> so<00:00:26.840> I<00:00:27.170> had<00:00:27.619> a<00:00:27.650> couple<00:00:27.980> of<00:00:28.100> fused<00:00:28.520> toe<00:00:28.700> bones

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
and so I had a couple of fused toe bones

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.970 
and so I had a couple of fused toe bones
that<00:00:29.180> when<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:29.810> would<00:00:30.260> tried<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.619> walk<00:00:30.770> on<00:00:30.950> that

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
that when I would tried to walk on that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.040 
that when I would tried to walk on that
when<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:31.279> was<00:00:31.430> one<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:32.300> they<00:00:32.509> just<00:00:32.780> roll<00:00:33.020> out

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
when I was one that they just roll out

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.040 
when I was one that they just roll out
from<00:00:33.380> under<00:00:33.800> me<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.579> they<00:00:34.760> were<00:00:34.820> not<00:00:35.510> useful<00:00:35.690> at

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
from under me so they were not useful at

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.400 
from under me so they were not useful at
all

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
all

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.280 
all
and<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.280> when<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:37.550> was<00:00:37.730> 13<00:00:38.570> months<00:00:38.690> old<00:00:38.900> they

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
and so when I was 13 months old they

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.780 
and so when I was 13 months old they
amputated<00:00:40.329> the<00:00:41.470> toe<00:00:42.470> bones<00:00:42.710> off<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:43.610> I

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
amputated the toe bones off so that I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.240 
amputated the toe bones off so that I
could<00:00:44.239> wear<00:00:44.570> prosthesis<00:00:44.960> more<00:00:45.680> effectively

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
could wear prosthesis more effectively

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.540 
could wear prosthesis more effectively
