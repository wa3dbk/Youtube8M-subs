00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.939
 good afternoon guys with you company not 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.439
 I present to you in Iraq the company is her friends 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:26.050
 but yesterday did orlika like you 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.920
 show as you can see at the very bottom I go there 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 slept a little 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.750
 in principle, the very bottom to make a minus 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.990
 four strands of such steep rather minus 3 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:52.200
 it's okay I don't remember my face 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:54.300
 I have 2 just have to look then 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.300
 see instead of the steep tank below 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.660
 it right now vitalka there will go down 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660
 cook 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.580
 the truth of course do not go really lucky 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.979
 nothing will affect me much 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:16.900
 attention does not pay them Peter slowly 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:20.130
 E50 will now wet to not be distracted 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.130
 on larger strands 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.479
 Here the object is generally not clear what will be 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.479
 create an hour 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:41.040
 would he hurry the pit principle to vanshot and 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.790
 hit and then in general he is in this water and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.790
 stuck 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.340
 on defense and were on ukrainian 5 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.340
 forever and ever 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.759
 I do not know what they hurt with this shot 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.289
 he somehow now would be so slow 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.729
 turn around that is not at all clear 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:05.380
 what happened to him like the calls are not 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.270
 there was no engines never but 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.680
 there probably broke his engines because 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.290
 that generally unfold him so here 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 already minus 32 of them are so tough 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.810
 Of course they helped me of course the paddle 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.269
 of course that the meat attention is small 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.130
 although then it is already t-62 and drive around on 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:37.180
 I was littered but they did not have enough guard 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.480
 make me here too i think 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.319
 Now I will tie it once but again to me 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.819
 then help and walked t-62 he distracted how well 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.450
 you see he all look at me and 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.670
 watching think at least some plants 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.540
 then I just shoot him but I 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:01.090
 I waited for my moment and then I let him 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:06.299
 here baby sweaty guy too long brake 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.660
 some in general almost i took him too 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:16.190
 on my stake 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:18.350
 also wanted 4 already done ok I already 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.690
 to celebrate shot on the move I think on 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:28.760
 any case can get even cooler 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:31.960
 will it be that type of noise I still remember 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.160
 even a hundred percent no read I'm at 108 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:39.710
 read the thief and not that which the ambulance China 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:47.140
 for pump so i will generally on it 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.140
 probably the funniest moment 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.340
 its 7 levels of the series spill 7 level 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:03.580
 you tank I'll be fourth now 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:07.080
 bomb hryas so here is such a fight 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.209
 fast principle dynamic survived -4 on 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.700
 the bottom 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.389
 at home 2 and a half is not the point 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.049
 medal earned let's all bye 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.459
