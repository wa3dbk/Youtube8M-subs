off the whole deal about getting back

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.880 
off the whole deal about getting back
into<00:01:33.630> shape<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.000> goal<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.750> from<00:01:36.960> 114

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
into shape so the goal is to go from 114

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.840 
into shape so the goal is to go from 114
down<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.640> 109<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.229> ideal<00:01:40.799> ideal<00:01:41.280> ideal
