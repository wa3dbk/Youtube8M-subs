thought beyond the hair all the
accessories<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.869> vote<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> hair

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
accessories I would vote for the hair

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.899 
accessories I would vote for the hair
just<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.979> vote<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> minute<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
just to vote a minute because this is

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.100 
just to vote a minute because this is
he's<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.299> fun<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> look<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:42.899> he's<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
he's just fun to look at he's a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.330 
he's just fun to look at he's a
character<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.890> almost<00:01:44.040> unfair

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
character I think it's almost unfair

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.950 
character I think it's almost unfair
because<00:01:44.640> when<00:01:44.939> he<00:01:45.030> dances<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> hair<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> going

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
because when he dances the hair is going

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
because when he dances the hair is going
to<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.380> dancing<00:01:46.770> along<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to kind of be dancing along with them I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.310 
to kind of be dancing along with them I
think<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.479> almost<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.229> has

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
think that's that's almost like he has

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.899 
think that's that's almost like he has
double<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.619> dancing<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.460> lot<00:01:50.880> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
double the dancing that's now a lot of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
double the dancing that's now a lot of
people<00:01:51.030> i'm<00:01:51.390> sure<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.810> fall<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.229> love<00:01:52.409> with

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
