00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hey cool chinada we are going to do something 

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:08.549
 super fun and disgusting king mucus 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.370
 kong or gorilla baba or whatever you want 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:14.129
 call for this we need paint 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.020
 acrylic vegetable paint and glue 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.530
 transparent or white glue 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.480
 traditional and also liquid starch is 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.170
 necessary that it be liquid in spray 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.180
 This is like the star ingredient 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.640
 well let's empty in a top where 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.369
 you want to resist white or glue 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.400
 white and a little bit of acrylic paint 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.350
 we are going to stir very well I suggest you 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.960
 do it according to everything because you do not go to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 use as creams or something that is no longer 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 go to use because then there is a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 little bit smeared good stir very 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.980
 ok and now let's put a little bit 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.960
 of liquid starch we are stirring you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.510
 you will be feeling how you are doing 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
 a mixture like sticky 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 I do not have exact measurements because I tried 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.070
 do it precisely and in some paintings 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.199
 I needed more starch and in others less 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 vÃ©lez placing up to do this kind of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.350
 very local mixes very little 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 bit is to say ones that I will tell you a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.150
 Soda poppet the scramble and other 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.830
 time until you have something like that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 you can play and you get out of the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 hands is all sticky and also it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.420
 feels very rich 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.420
 we do exactly the same but with 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 transparent glue some do 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.850
 also with liquid silicone I did it 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.549
 with transparent glue and a droplet 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 of vegetable paint of those who eat 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.380
 with just a little bit of perfect paint 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.750
 you can choose the color you want 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.179
 but stirring very well so that the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.429
 color is even and then you know 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.189
 let's go putting a little bit of 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.740
 liquid starch look very good right 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.259
 requirement that you throw him and already starts to 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.200
 separate and dresses and the mixture 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.990
 starts to be like jelly now for 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.819
 give a crazier touch more bright 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.640
 let's put a little bit of 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.640
 glitter of the color that you want and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.130
 now to stir it up and your mucus now goes to 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.019
 shine I will place these there is a 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.110
 little bit more starch to make it 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.890
 perfect the mixture of chewing gum and mucus or 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.620
 whatever they want to call it, be perfect 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.810

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.490
 I also observed the seasons 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.440
 very rich remember that you can do it 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.480
 of the colors that you want 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.330
 important is that the paint is acrylic 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.970
 and get in the liquid nest not in 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.820
 strike already with extended is much more 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.440

 snot you can play with dinosaurs 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.410
 using that are falling in a lava 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.170

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.300
 it's up to you to get undone or you can play 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.820
