 we explain how you do it for the national industry 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.710
 this alternative was born as an effort of Peruvian businessmen 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.489
 when we have a cutting-edge technology factory 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.390
 where we produce a cement 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.710
 with international and national quality standards 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.930
 our 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.000
 percent produced around 75 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.890

 and now it seems to have been prepared 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.920
 I took the cement factory 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.540
 for forklifts as we arrived 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.930
 some things 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.680
 but this is Peru 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.100
 efe the guarantee 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.060
 to build their buildings 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.310
 at a low cost 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.290
 and why is it a year and in addition 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.390
 well we this was added a survey 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.950
 with cutting edge technology 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.230
 we are on alert 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.140
 with raw materials selected by having in itself a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.150
 very good quality cement 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.380
 of that segment that expected 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.240
 public to build it we have a goal of it is lethal and your fight 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.920
 much oriented to the segment 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.220
 much more likely to be racism 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.800
