00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the end to the LED fits in it and then

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.509 
the end to the LED fits in it and then
the<00:02:15.140> whole<00:02:15.319> idea<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.340> will

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
the whole idea is is that this will

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.670 
the whole idea is is that this will
light<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:17.000> with<00:02:17.510> burner<00:02:17.840> effects<00:02:18.319> which<00:02:18.530> are

inside<00:02:19.249> ok<00:02:19.819> so<00:02:19.879> really<00:02:20.840> coming<00:02:21.200> along<00:02:21.439> nicely

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
inside ok so really coming along nicely

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.070 
inside ok so really coming along nicely
