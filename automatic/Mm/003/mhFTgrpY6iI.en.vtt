00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
realizing that a lot of families were

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.710 
realizing that a lot of families were
not<00:04:53.100> gonna<00:04:53.220> be<00:04:53.430> as<00:04:53.550> lucky<00:04:53.729> as<00:04:53.970> our<00:04:54.150> family<00:04:54.510> was

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
not gonna be as lucky as our family was

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.500 
not gonna be as lucky as our family was
so<00:04:55.650> I'm<00:04:55.740> very<00:04:56.010> grateful<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.760> he<00:04:57.120> came<00:04:57.300> home

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
so I'm very grateful that he came home

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.219 
so I'm very grateful that he came home
very<00:04:58.229> grateful<00:04:58.650> for<00:04:58.800> what<00:04:58.950> he<00:04:58.979> did<00:04:59.600> I<00:05:00.600> think

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
very grateful for what he did I think

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.340 
very grateful for what he did I think
sometimes<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:02.400> seems<00:05:02.760> like<00:05:03.030> like<00:05:04.020> what<00:05:04.229> they

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
sometimes it seems like like what they

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.840 
sometimes it seems like like what they
might<00:05:04.500> be<00:05:04.530> fighting<00:05:04.950> for<00:05:04.979> their<00:05:05.400> deaths<00:05:05.640> might

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
might be fighting for their deaths might

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.219 
might be fighting for their deaths might
be<00:05:06.000> senseless<00:05:06.620> but<00:05:08.479> their<00:05:09.479> willingness<00:05:09.930> and

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
be senseless but their willingness and

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.240 
be senseless but their willingness and
their<00:05:11.120> their<00:05:12.120> service<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:13.050> not<00:05:13.620> senseless<00:05:14.130> I

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
their their service is not senseless I

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.120 
their their service is not senseless I
think<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:15.110> that's<00:05:16.110> kind<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.440> what<00:05:16.650> defines

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
think that's that's kind of what defines

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.900 
think that's that's kind of what defines
them<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:18.090> a<00:05:18.240> sense<00:05:18.510> that<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:20.190> know<00:05:20.220> anyone<00:05:20.700> who

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
them in a sense that you know anyone who

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.640 
them in a sense that you know anyone who
would<00:05:21.390> be<00:05:21.570> willing<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.900> put<00:05:22.169> their<00:05:22.350> life<00:05:22.500> on

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
would be willing to put their life on

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.490 
would be willing to put their life on
the<00:05:22.740> line<00:05:22.919> for<00:05:22.950> others<00:05:23.370> is<00:05:24.229> definitely<00:05:25.229> that

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
the line for others is definitely that

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.940 
the line for others is definitely that
gives<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> lot<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:25.979> meaning<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.250> their<00:05:26.460> lives<00:05:26.610> I

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
gives a lot of meaning to their lives I

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.230 
gives a lot of meaning to their lives I
think<00:05:28.950> it's<00:05:29.040> very<00:05:29.190> easy<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.729> forget<00:05:30.060> about

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
think it's very easy to forget about

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.830 
think it's very easy to forget about
everyone<00:05:31.100> who's<00:05:32.100> lost<00:05:32.970> their<00:05:33.210> life<00:05:33.419> given<00:05:33.780> the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
everyone who's lost their life given the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.730 
everyone who's lost their life given the
ultimate<00:05:34.200> sacrifice<00:05:34.669> for<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:36.240> country<00:05:36.740> it's

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
ultimate sacrifice for this country it's

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.570 
ultimate sacrifice for this country it's
easy<00:05:37.919> to<00:05:38.100> get

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
easy to get

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.749 
easy to get
caught<00:05:40.300> up<00:05:40.479> in<00:05:40.629> the<00:05:40.720> day-to-day<00:05:40.900> activities

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
caught up in the day-to-day activities

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.760 
caught up in the day-to-day activities
and<00:05:42.759> so<00:05:42.879> I<00:05:42.909> think<00:05:43.030> it's<00:05:43.270> important<00:05:43.770> during

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
and so I think it's important during

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.219 
and so I think it's important during
Memorial<00:05:45.580> Day<00:05:45.729> not<00:05:46.060> only<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.479> enjoy<00:05:46.629> yourself

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
Memorial Day not only to enjoy yourself

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.920 
Memorial Day not only to enjoy yourself
but<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.770> take<00:05:47.919> a<00:05:47.979> moment<00:05:48.189> to<00:05:48.460> remember<00:05:48.930> the

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
but to take a moment to remember the

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.070 
but to take a moment to remember the
life<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.560> service<00:05:50.949> and<00:05:51.099> sacrifice<00:05:51.580> of<00:05:52.080> the

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
life the service and sacrifice of the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.719 
life the service and sacrifice of the
service<00:05:53.680> men<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:53.889> women<00:05:54.009> of<00:05:54.280> this<00:05:54.370> country

service men and women of this country

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.879 
service men and women of this country
it's<00:05:55.210> not<00:05:55.449> easy<00:05:55.840> it's<00:05:56.169> really<00:05:56.469> hard<00:05:56.650> to<00:05:56.740> leave

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
it's not easy it's really hard to leave

it's not easy it's really hard to leave
your<00:05:57.009> family<00:05:57.189> and<00:05:57.580> everything<00:05:57.909> behind<00:05:58.060> but
