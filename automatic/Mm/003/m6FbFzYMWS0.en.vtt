00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
if you don't have a skimmer where do you

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.940 
if you don't have a skimmer where do you
put<00:00:21.610> your<00:00:21.730> palm<00:00:21.940> you<00:00:22.270> know<00:00:23.020> bottom<00:00:23.800> of<00:00:23.890> the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
put your palm you know bottom of the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.920 
put your palm you know bottom of the
pond<00:00:24.160> that's<00:00:24.880> pretty<00:00:25.090> obvious<00:00:25.240> solution

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
pond that's pretty obvious solution

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.300 
pond that's pretty obvious solution
stick<00:00:26.260> up<00:00:26.500> in<00:00:26.620> the<00:00:26.680> bottom<00:00:26.920> upon<00:00:27.100> you're<00:00:27.220> gonna

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
stick up in the bottom upon you're gonna

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.640 
stick up in the bottom upon you're gonna
get<00:00:27.490> great<00:00:27.700> circulation<00:00:28.510> but<00:00:29.290> there's<00:00:29.560> a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
get great circulation but there's a

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.069 
get great circulation but there's a
couple<00:00:29.860> of<00:00:29.980> potential<00:00:30.250> problems<00:00:30.700> with<00:00:30.789> that

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
couple of potential problems with that

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.370 
couple of potential problems with that
number<00:00:32.079> one<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.700> pump<00:00:33.910> clogs<00:00:34.360> which<00:00:35.200> it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
number one if the pump clogs which it

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.660 
number one if the pump clogs which it
can<00:00:35.650> because<00:00:36.040> that's<00:00:36.130> where<00:00:36.370> most<00:00:36.490> of<00:00:36.579> your

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
can because that's where most of your

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.430 
can because that's where most of your
said<00:00:36.880> them<00:00:37.000> it's<00:00:37.090> going<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.270> be<00:00:37.420> you<00:00:38.110> can<00:00:38.140> burn

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
said them it's going to be you can burn

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.130 
said them it's going to be you can burn
up<00:00:38.500> your<00:00:38.770> palm<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.120> solution<00:00:40.630> to<00:00:40.690> that<00:00:40.750> is

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
up your palm now the solution to that is

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.410 
up your palm now the solution to that is
to<00:00:41.710> have<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.010> pump<00:00:42.370> that<00:00:42.520> can<00:00:42.610> handle<00:00:42.820> solids

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
to have a pump that can handle solids

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.569 
to have a pump that can handle solids
you<00:00:43.780> know<00:00:43.870> solids<00:00:44.380> handling<00:00:44.530> pump<00:00:44.950> their

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
you know solids handling pump their

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.130 
you know solids handling pump their
pumps<00:00:45.910> out<00:00:46.030> there<00:00:46.149> that<00:00:46.270> can<00:00:46.390> pump<00:00:46.600> golf<00:00:46.870> balls

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
pumps out there that can pump golf balls

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.690 
pumps out there that can pump golf balls
thrown<00:00:47.470> without<00:00:47.680> clogging<00:00:47.920> it's<00:00:48.550> one

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
thrown without clogging it's one

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.090 
thrown without clogging it's one
solution<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.300> could<00:00:50.020> also<00:00:50.230> put<00:00:50.649> some<00:00:50.710> netting

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
solution you could also put some netting

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.310 
solution you could also put some netting
around<00:00:51.370> your<00:00:51.489> pump<00:00:51.700> by<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.000> pump<00:00:52.660> protector<00:00:53.200> or

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
around your pump by a pump protector or

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.350 
around your pump by a pump protector or
a<00:00:53.350> pump<00:00:53.590> cage<00:00:53.860> you<00:00:54.579> know<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.790> protectors<00:00:55.239> are

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
a pump cage you know the protectors are

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.900 
a pump cage you know the protectors are
normally<00:00:55.660> netting<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:57.190> bottom<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.610> kind<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.850> a

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
normally netting the bottom is kind of a

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.130 
normally netting the bottom is kind of a
ring<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.350> has<00:00:59.850> its<00:01:00.850> like<00:01:00.969> some<00:01:01.149> lead<00:01:01.480> or<00:01:01.780> some

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
ring that has its like some lead or some

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.690 
ring that has its like some lead or some
kind<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.469> weight<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:03.280> keep<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.550> at<00:01:03.640> the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
kind of a weight to keep it at the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.460 
kind of a weight to keep it at the
bottom<00:01:04.059> then<00:01:04.479> your<00:01:04.600> pump<00:01:04.780> goes<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.409> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
bottom then your pump goes in and the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.320 
bottom then your pump goes in and the
top<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:05.830> more<00:01:05.979> of<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.159> floating<00:01:06.400> ring<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.210> it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
top is more of a floating ring so it

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.600 
top is more of a floating ring so it
keeps<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:08.409> net<00:01:08.620> up<00:01:08.830> those<00:01:09.310> are<00:01:09.430> pretty

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
keeps the the net up those are pretty

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.250 
keeps the the net up those are pretty
inexpensive<00:01:09.820> ways<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.420> do<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:10.930> there's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
inexpensive ways to do it and there's

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.310 
inexpensive ways to do it and there's
also<00:01:11.440> some<00:01:11.830> plastic<00:01:12.370> cages<00:01:13.180> basically<00:01:14.110> that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
also some plastic cages basically that

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.870 
also some plastic cages basically that
anything<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.010> can<00:01:15.130> fit<00:01:15.280> through<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.640> cage

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
anything that can fit through the cage

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.760 
anything that can fit through the cage
can<00:01:16.750> fit<00:01:16.960> through<00:01:17.140> your<00:01:17.290> pumps<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.650> don't

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
can fit through your pumps you don't

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.980 
can fit through your pumps you don't
have<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.920> worry<00:01:18.040> about<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.310> clogging<00:01:18.760> now<00:01:19.540> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
probably a burnout pump so that's kind

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.010 
probably a burnout pump so that's kind
of<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.070> problem<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.640> know<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.630> other<00:01:58.750> thing

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
of a problem you know the other thing

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.920 
of a problem you know the other thing
that<00:01:59.049> can<00:01:59.229> happen<00:01:59.439> is<00:02:00.299> say<00:02:01.299> even<00:02:01.600> if<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:01.750> don't

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
that can happen is say even if you don't

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.990 
that can happen is say even if you don't
have<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> waterfall<00:02:02.740> system<00:02:03.250> your<00:02:03.640> filter

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
have a waterfall system your filter

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.730 
have a waterfall system your filter
could<00:02:04.150> clog<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.630> could<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> sort<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.680> a

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
could clog you could have a sort of a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.039 
could clog you could have a sort of a
filter<00:02:05.950> system<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:06.490> could<00:02:06.759> clog<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.720> cause

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
filter system that could clog and cause

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.229 
filter system that could clog and cause
it<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.289> overflow<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.189> you're<00:02:09.340> using<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.700> gravity

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
it to overflow so you're using a gravity

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.080 
it to overflow so you're using a gravity
return<00:02:10.630> type<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.380> filter<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:12.489> easy<00:02:12.730> if

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
return type of filter and it's easy if

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.510 
return type of filter and it's easy if
that<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.510> easy<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.900> happen<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.830> know<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:14.980> even

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
that is easy to happen you know and even

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.550 
that is easy to happen you know and even
in<00:02:16.510> situations<00:02:16.780> where<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.319> wouldn't<00:02:17.470> think

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
in situations where you wouldn't think

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.949 
in situations where you wouldn't think
there's<00:02:17.830> any<00:02:17.980> chance<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.640> clogging<00:02:19.239> you

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
there's any chance of it clogging you

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.380 
there's any chance of it clogging you
know<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.110> ran<00:02:20.500> into<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.920> with<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> cold<00:02:22.120> weather

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
know I ran into that with a cold weather

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.059 
know I ran into that with a cold weather
we<00:02:22.540> got<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> cold<00:02:22.989> snap<00:02:23.200> kind<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.470> blew<00:02:23.830> ahead

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
we got a cold snap kind of blew ahead

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.449 
we got a cold snap kind of blew ahead
and<00:02:24.190> turn<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> filters<00:02:24.790> off<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:26.430> because<00:02:27.430> of

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
and turn the filters off and because of

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.890 
and turn the filters off and because of
the<00:02:27.610> way<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.819> was<00:02:27.910> circulating<00:02:28.420> my<00:02:28.540> filter

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the way it was circulating my filter

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.600 
the way it was circulating my filter
first<00:02:29.080> somehow<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.709> froze

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
first somehow it froze

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
you know the outlet froze they but the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.770 
you know the outlet froze they but the
inlet<00:02:32.860> didn't<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.879> of<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> sudden<00:02:34.270> I'm
