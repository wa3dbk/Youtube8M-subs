00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 good 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.900
 how to solve the problem of 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.410
 blackmagic cinema quarry battery 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.410
 can dance 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.250
 and good if you remember this when you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.950
 I mentioned in black magic reviews 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.680
 cinema camera the only real problem that 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.900
 has is the battery because as they can 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.449
 see is an internal battery there is no how 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.610
 take out that there is how to remove it obviously 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.150
 but it would be process beyond the liquor and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 another camera of nothing else to touch a 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.980
 little thing to know a little cap that great 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.290
 that does not happen until then 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.120
 solution is this gadget 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.920
 that will end a bit back 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.500
 teach the best 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.929
 what it basically is is a basis for 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.449
 a the base for a battery with a 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.699
 cable that connects directly to the camera 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.090
 as if we were carrying the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.649
 directly from electricity is 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.840
 specifically made by eiken 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.420
 how can you see there 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.880
 this one is black black magic single 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.820
 down this existing dove world road 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.120
 ronald for all this 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.979
 rods mount it in two or to assemble 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.360
 none like this one or there are others for 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.100
 the batteries that are not of canon in 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.900
 this case obviously I have batteries 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.490
 of canon because my other camera is canon 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.310
 and I've only used things that they will do in the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.979
 life almost almost then forgiveness then 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.720
 I have obviously canon things so 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.690
 that I have batteries like this one that is a 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.820
 bp 941 of canon 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.820
 which is the type of battery that accepts 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.890
 this specific important and that has 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 has of many other types more than 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.340
 batteries do not worry about let's go to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.860
 search on their website and they will 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.360
 find it costs around 70 dollars 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.680
 but it is a very useful accessory if you want 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.050
 better performance of your black magic 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.380
 this career cinema also sell 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.970
 much more batteries this powerful and a lot 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.510
 larger than others from other models of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.950
 different cameras that have everything 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.090
 kind of options what is base noses 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.690
 conjunction then what it does is put 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.360
 the battery 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.629
 If I can do it right now 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.629
 to do it 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:36.870
 perfect that lights we're just from 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.870
 electricity let's flip the camera 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.420
 and we are going to ascend 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.420
 no this 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.940
 igniting are observed is already the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.350
 camera 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.150
 really here we are not going to put anything 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.040
 special because we are seeing the pure 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.990
 background but we wait for the battery of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.080
 this side 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.069
 we removed the flap this for the battery and 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.680
 insert the cable 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.800
 as if we were just 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.760
 loading what 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.520
 of electricity to this then yes 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.380
 we can appreciate well this we are going to 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.380
 I'm going to zoom in so they can see 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.620
 there you see 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.799
 there the perfect ray symbol is 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.239
 that the battery is being charged as if 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.890
 I was charging from electricity 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.500
 ordinary then we have the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.930
 accessory forgiveness for the paper the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.569
 accessory is perfectly loading it 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.220
 with canon battery directly the 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 blackmagic camera so it's 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.519
 fulfilling its mission is important 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.280
 let's go to comfort comfort truth 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.049
 with a sense already of the camera a 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.579
 little bit more armed which is what 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.120
 obviously we would have in a real world or 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.400
 if we are going to change to that 7 here and good 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.989
 here we can already have a 7 or more a 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.489
 little more realistic is not only the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.250
 more realistic but they go here we have a 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.620
 game focus we have the two reeds as 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.569
 can see here is 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.900
 and nothing else really no we're not with 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.840
 greater sense of things and here is the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.829
 mount on the battery 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.389
 so for you to see it in more detail 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.389
 and as you can see the cable is perfectly 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.490
 in fact it gives much more than that in case 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.900
 have to put another side for example in 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.460
 this case I put it in front which is a 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.349
 little more uncomfortable but if they looked I have 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.520
 space back in this cane this is not what 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.110
 more recommendable but if they had 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.550
 space back for example I could put it 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.830
 back and so it does not get in the way 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.979
 frontal space so we can see better the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.050
 focus if I get the camera and the gifts 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.780
 of the clock and well our review but it's 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.569
 how to fix this problem of 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.180
 the battery of the black magic cinema that 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.889
 lasts and the greens I go all for is 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.159
 destroyed how to solve the problem 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.940
 the battery of black magic cinema cÃ¡ner 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.560
 I hope that from the video if it is that 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.460
 they have the same situation problem 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.560
 remember 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.050
 this solution exists for more cameras not 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.639
 just for this so keep in mind 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.470
 they just go and they will be able to serve 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.539
 because not only for this one are not this one 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.490
 directly connect electricity or 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.349
 there are other similar means for 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.759
 which I am going to use this in your 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.169
 cameras so if you have this problem 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.400
 I encourage you to investigate so 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.949
 there is probably a solution 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.300
 similar this I am the one who came in and 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.639
 I remember you go to Tripoli picture 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.349
 dotcom and see all the posts that 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.130
 We have done if you have any questions 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.210
 it will be gmail.com and if you want this to be 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.650
 within the community 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.789
 peters like everyone we have 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.370
 now box 2000 almost this one 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.069
 I remember that they go to facebook twitter 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.680
 groups and instagram to be part of 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.270
 of the topics in twitters and if they have not 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.060
 done do it down here can 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.780
 subscribe give and comment I see them in 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.780
 the next video
