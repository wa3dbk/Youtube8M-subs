that<00:04:11.669> little<00:04:11.939> bit<00:04:12.060> better<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:13.079> can<00:04:13.199> either

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:13.289 
that little bit better you can either

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.159 
that little bit better you can either
avoid<00:04:13.949> the<00:04:14.340> hot<00:04:14.459> spots<00:04:14.759> and<00:04:15.120> make<00:04:15.810> sure<00:04:15.840> that

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
avoid the hot spots and make sure that

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.990 
avoid the hot spots and make sure that
you<00:04:16.259> just<00:04:16.440> take<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.799> outside<00:04:17.370> route<00:04:17.639> of<00:04:17.820> those

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
you just take the outside route of those

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.550 
you just take the outside route of those
hot<00:04:18.209> spots<00:04:18.329> knowing<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.079> that's<00:04:19.199> where<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
hot spots knowing that that's where the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.810 
hot spots knowing that that's where the
action<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:19.889> going<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.250> be<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:21.269> that's<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.820> hot

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
action is going to be so that's the hot

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.909 
action is going to be so that's the hot

spot for the map dome let's take a

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.310 
spot for the map dome let's take a
little<00:04:26.400> bit<00:04:26.520> more<00:04:26.699> of<00:04:26.820> an<00:04:26.909> analysis<00:04:27.479> of<00:04:27.719> the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
little bit more of an analysis of the

flags going to be you can see where the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.930 
flags going to be you can see where the
spawns<00:04:51.240> spots<00:04:52.080> are<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.580> can<00:04:53.760> start

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
spawns spots are so you can start

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.360 
spawns spots are so you can start
planning<00:04:54.150> your<00:04:54.360> route

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370

how close the area is to your spawn my
suggestion<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.870> if<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.200> spawn<00:05:36.500> there<00:05:36.830> then<00:05:37.610> 32

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090
