00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.920
 except those wounded there no he looks 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.910
 to have anyhow no harm he 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.230
 just made a small sprain of 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.120
 ankle but we can not play with 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.460
 a sprained ankle basketball fights 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.380
 you and me no but ideal where he can and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.510
 pretty good even because during this game 6 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.970
 finals from 88 to lisa thomass a 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.650
 planted 43 points including 25 in the only 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.880
 third quarter a record of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.380
 points on a final board that holds 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.369
 always besides for a player who 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.330
 had just twisted badly the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.520
 ankle that's pretty good 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.170
 unfortunately for ramires and pistols 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.180
 this huge performance did not prevent 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.010
 the magic lakers and warzee to win 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.360
 this match to force a game seven 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.280
 that they will win a few more days 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.360
 late after losing in seven matches 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.620
 the conference final years 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.840
 Previous to larry celtics 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.370
 bird thomas cc bad boys had thus passed 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.930
 a course in this year 88 but had 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.520
 not yet reached the skull but this 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.320
 was only partly postponed because since his 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.850
 arrival in nba in 81 the one we 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.620
 nickname etc and where the head assassin 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.600
 has never stopped impressing 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.420
 observers and feast the fans a 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.130
 puny physique 1 m 85 for 80 kg but 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.750
 a nice speed a big relaxation a 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.199
 vision of the extraordinary game and a mind of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.910
 warrior 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.280
 the kind of guys ready to die on a 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.200
 parquet and then technically but 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.000
 what a very strong monster in penetration 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.320
 asia do not hesitate to challenge the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.310
 big under the circle but he's 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.990
 also capable of shooter 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.920
 effectively in the perimeter especially 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.360
 out of dribble 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 which made him a great scorer 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.030
 complete which is by the way still the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.650
 most prolific marker of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.940
 pistols history with almost ten 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.160
 nine thousand points enrolled in the course of 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.620
 his 13 seasons and as for his 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.080
 ability to make passes that say 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.550
 wow deliver assists in 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.650
 such large quantities while being 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.890
 as creative in history nba what 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.150
 player can boast good y'a magic 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.700
 possibly steve nash in the cinema 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.810
 who is not very big 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.370
 always is it that with more than 9000 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.560
 Career places told 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.350
 shots of course the record of the pistols and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.340
 with an average of 9.3 caviar of 91 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.960
 at 94 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.220
 he's just the fourth 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.860
 best passer of the history among the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.510
 players having 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.760
 neither their career abbas has immediately 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.330
 his class a man but the most 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.680
 impressive 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.450
 maybe even the most spectacular 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.280
 at risi in tomasz clearly remains the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.770
 quality the speed and creativity of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.270
 his dribbling obviously when paga can 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.320
 do you do that in full defending match 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.240
 on him is taking the risk of getting 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.510
 humiliate at any time in any 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.750
 at night with players limit to 15.1 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.980
 mike holston what do you think about it 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.300
 as in addition he was the tenuous kind in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.650
 defense we can say without too much 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.850
 to fool that he was the best little 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.120
 have walked the floors of the great 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.620
 dam 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.180
 and if you surround and one of the best 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.340
 leaders of a gentleman's story 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.380
 talented hairline also 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.270
 rough than effective the whole coached by 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.160
 a fox such as chuck daly you 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.600
 get the bad boys this team 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.950
 so decried but so strong 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.650
 who was champion twice in a row 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.180
 in 89 and 90 in the wake of a Nazi to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.040
 thomas which was also mvp 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.890
 finals in the second title with a 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.200
 line of stats well glitzy 27.6 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.820
 points 7.5 assists 5 rebounds and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.709
 almost 2 interceptions per match on 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.090
 a series of good finals obviously there 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.850
 we know who it is is the best guarantor 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.440
 and yes it's bad boys this group 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.790
 paramilitary whose favorite hobby 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.769
 was to provoke pushing 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.180
 the opponent is bad boys who were 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.950
 so two-time champion in the middle of 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.110
 celtics of larry bird bulls 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.760
 jordan or magic lakers those there 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.090
 even who leave the field without tightening 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.070
 the hand 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.600
 without taking a look at their opponent 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.799
 after this fairy sweep in the final of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.560
 conference in 91 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.900
 we are far from the coubertin spirit yes 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.640
 it's bad boys these tracks hated and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.750
 fears this team of butchers 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.190
 parquet floors against which the most 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.989
 big basketball legends broke 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.850
 the teeth and well said to thomas get 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.830
 was the boss the chief general 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.750
 the guide whoever gives the orders 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.980
 the one who gives the rhythm the one who fucks 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.600
 the shit the first is that the big 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.980
 come to defend then the one who has 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.150
 learned the basics of the job a big 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.100
 sick like dennis rodman 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.959
 yes that was also izia thomass 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.459
 by the way, some people have paid very 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.350
 dear to thomas his behavior very 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.390
 borderline and its sulfurous reputation 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.799
 I order for example he his revenge on 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.330
 and outside the parquet because no 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.830
 glad to have finally defeated his enemies 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.970
 jurors in 91 after three eliminations 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.709
 row 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.150
 Mike was clearly at the origin of the 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.200
 no selection of asia to thomas in the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.600
 dream team of 90 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.250
 so while he's definitely the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.079
 best leader in activity at this time 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.220
 that he already has two rings to his credit and 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.050
 that he's on his way to the hall of fame 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.860
 asia to tomasz will not be part of 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.860
 this team that marks rattle 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.530
 sportingly it was an injustice 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.970
 at the same time when the best player 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.910
 the one you absolutely want in 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.350
 the team explains the choice was quickly made 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.459
 on the side of the staff of the USA team who 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.930
 needed to build a group 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.820
 and who therefore took a more option 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.660
 pacific with stockton to know that 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.130
 remains correct at the leads 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.180
 but we can not say that the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.800
 other dream team hours cried on 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.220
 out of the bad boy what do you think about 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.750
 scotty for revenge in the month of 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.580
 November 91 only a few weeks 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.320
 after this non-selection of platforms 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.030
 plants at 44 points on the head of 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.710
 stockton me I believe he's trying to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.300
 get a message in the month of 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.980
 December next track is jazz 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.390
 meet again and karl malone do not 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.730
 deprived himself of giving his answer to 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.650
 happiness bad boys in his way all 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.870
 finesse a kind of big parcels 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.330
 sent by registered mail 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.400
 result 40 stitches for 18 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.470
 against a small fine and a match of 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.300
 suspension for the mailman abala on is 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.770
 well beyond ben arfa and a welcome 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.180
 in the nba of the 90s gentlemen 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.800
 ladies 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.120
 that's just as good as 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.280
 that player he was bad coach 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.080
 manager afterwards equally adulated and 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.120
 respected by the fans his teammates 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.380
 that hated by his opponents said to 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.600
 thomas this name remains no less a leader 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.910
 of legend a hall of fame hours in 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.440
 creativity self-denial and the taste of 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.740
 fight will have branded the 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.740
 parks m
