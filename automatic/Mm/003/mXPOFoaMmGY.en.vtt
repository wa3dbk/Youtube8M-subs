00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.600
 with whatever comes another video on 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.480
 there is a demand service on the market 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.339
 not enough larvae maxdome 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.859
 and co cover the german market too 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.669
 already enough, but this time it is 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.579
 really different 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.429
 whatever comes right to start with apps 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:29.179
 for ios and android out and running as 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.919
 web application on the mac pc too 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.579
 And that is unique in Germany 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.019
 is there a connection to the apple tv the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.910
 service starts with a whole 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.809
 decent number of movies and 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.820
 TV series 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.969
 exact numbers called the provider but 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.239
 not 30 days you can do whatever 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:51.170
 free trial after that you pay 9 euros 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.899
 per month via the ios app or apple tv 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.670
 you can easily subscribe to the service 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.329
 and you can return every month 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.429
 cancel 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.829
 But then you have to 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:06.980
 again itunes or the web version of 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:09.800
 mills the films and series are relatively 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.740
 currently the latest blockbuster is looking for you 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.990
 but in vain 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.710
 too bad is that no pixar film in 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.360
 the list is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.370
 we would actually have that 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.130
 calculated which apple already with the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.080
 apple tv is practically the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.850
 Suchfunktion does not just fill up 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.940
 title but also actor and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.220
 directors movies can be in one 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.900
 Save and rate favorite list 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.560
 and there is also an attachment 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.270
 facebook on the ipad or iphone sees 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.870
 the service is very similar to the one on the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.420
 Apple TV 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.640
 There is also one here 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.830
 offline mode you can watch movies so 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.810
 completely download and later to 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.790
 example in the plane watch if you 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.740
 No internet connection has been great 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.780
 we get the soundtrack at almost all 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.550
 switch film to the original version 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.420
 can 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.580
 just at British or 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.200
 American production are the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 original dialogues usually much better 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.479
 as the german dubbing in the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.250
 test works whatever prima 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.620
 the movies start fast and the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.930
 movie quality is okay though not all 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.400
 For 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.260
 in hd a few times we notice 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.780
 small trailer or the film jumps in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.060
 few minutes back it happens twice 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.730
 us to the best primetime between 20 and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 21 o'clock in the evening that we are browsing 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.049
 can not log in 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.810
 then only a lapidary overload comes 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.889
 message appears on the ipad 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.889
 message, however, not
