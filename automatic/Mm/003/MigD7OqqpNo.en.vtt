00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.830
 gentlemen ladies and creepers the day of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.200
 today we have nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.860
 best minecraft pianist with you 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.860
 this 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.310
 i 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.950
 Y 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.810
 ah 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.810
 ah 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.100
 Y 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.350
 well now we are going with the tutorial 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.049
 then how to build the piano 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.140
 here are different types of pianos these 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.210
 they are my slaves and there are different types 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.299
 of piano play even you can 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.149
 improve it and good if you did not realize 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.640
 in the theater that I was and in a big way 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.680
 the piano a few blocks more landmarks because 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.140
 it seemed to me that it was adequate 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.970
 in that big space 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.420
 a possible good 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.450
 for example this piano will be built 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.400
 builds with these materials the only 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.260
 what varies are if you want the rail 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.550
 propelled the good chair is a chair 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.290
 in quotes or the brick slab is 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.030
 the only thing that changes the brick slab 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.950
 of the material or the color in which it is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.110
 that do not stay still 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.330
 well then we started with this 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.670
 in her 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.780
 here is not being the other way around because 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.780
 is parallel to this 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.899
 and ready 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.560
 and see the kings 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.250
 and what would the chair be and there 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.069
 would be excellent a good that is one of 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.379
 the examples can also be done with 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.390
 rugs or carpets of wool of different 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.550
 colors I put two examples the color 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.430
 red and the color black because how is it 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.590
 they can give an account 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.359
 let's go with this I'm going to put the chair in 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.870
 first this time it's going to be invested 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.020
 I'm going to put the block k and be here what 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.850
 I'm going to put the other side 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.300
 but the same can be applied of any 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.780
 way is how you want to put it 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.780
 good there is the embarrÃ© 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.799
 this 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.909
 but we put the black hair that is 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.909
 as the most common I think 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.830
 the kings, I think they are left 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.930
 better you return them and normalitos the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.130
 little things of these in the propelled the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.650
 propelled I think they look better 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.250
 with this because of him 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.670
 the slab of the lower world block 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.640
 now we go with the last 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.140
 what is the red piano that is there as 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.230
 You can see it I think it looks better 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.800
 the one that seems to me the most that seems 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.450
 it looks like piano is this red the black 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.280
 I also think it looks but from 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.500
 soon from above 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.630
 the good red also looks like like 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
 piano and also from above in change 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.920
 in laws and you see from here it seems 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.020
 from where from any point of 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.040
 view 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.040
 he does not want to remove 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.790
 and I had to hit him 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:11.379
 it's like this two blocks quartz milestones 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.379
 and here the slabs and good 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.290
 lamarre 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.060
 his two that do not stay still 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.570
 Oh 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.240
 ready there is the third piano 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.710
 and well I hope you liked this 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.090
 video of the elector by the slaves good 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.370
 the slaves that are changing from 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.380
 corner every time and nothing good I am 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.180

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.010

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.170
 I do not know beards, I do not know how to make a house 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.360

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.240
