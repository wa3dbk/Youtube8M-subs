00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
team back jump energy and then he does

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.729 
team back jump energy and then he does
this<00:02:31.150> right<00:02:31.360> before<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.750> chorus<00:02:32.080> he's<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.470> G

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
this right before the chorus he's on G

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:40.309 
this right before the chorus he's on G

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
then he goes up to the sea which is the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.910 
then he goes up to the sea which is the
same<00:02:43.060> formation<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:44.830> 3550<00:02:45.610> me<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:46.030> string<00:02:46.920> he

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
same formation just 3550 me a string he

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.800 
same formation just 3550 me a string he
goes<00:02:48.160> back<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> G<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.209> then<00:02:49.299> back<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
goes back to the G and then back to the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.740 
goes back to the G and then back to the
seats<00:02:50.110> always<00:02:50.500> like<00:02:53.579> okay<00:02:54.579> so<00:02:55.359> it's<00:02:55.600> going<00:02:55.690> to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
seats always like okay so it's going to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.650 
seats always like okay so it's going to
take<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> little<00:02:56.079> practice<00:02:56.320> but

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:12.500 

No

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:22.410 

ok<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.780> chorus<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.640> SI<00:03:16.500> ji<00:03:17.500> ji<00:03:19.950> ji<00:03:20.950> c<00:03:21.820> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
ok so the chorus is SI ji ji ji c and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.670 
ok so the chorus is SI ji ji ji c and
we're<00:03:22.570> just<00:03:22.720> gonna<00:03:22.810> keep<00:03:23.020> your<00:03:23.200> feet<00:03:23.380> now<00:03:23.560> g

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.550 

gee<00:03:30.680> gee<00:03:31.569> ok<00:03:33.129> so<00:03:34.129> C<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.430> 355<00:03:35.200> on<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.379> a<00:03:36.409> string

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
gee gee ok so C is 355 on the a string

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.970 
gee gee ok so C is 355 on the a string
the<00:03:36.980> g<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.400> 355<00:03:37.879> but<00:03:38.269> on<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.450> low<00:03:38.750> E<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.409> then

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
the g is 355 but on the low E and then

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.780 
the g is 355 but on the low E and then
the<00:03:40.159> D<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.549> 355<00:03:41.090> days<00:03:41.780> straight<00:03:42.549> so<00:03:43.549> you<00:03:43.670> just

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the D is 355 days straight so you just

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.199 
the D is 355 days straight so you just
need<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:44.030> know<00:03:44.150> T<00:03:45.159> G<00:03:46.159> and<00:03:46.459> basically<00:03:46.909> he's

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
need to know T G and basically he's

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.100 
need to know T G and basically he's

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.149

so<00:05:42.210> man<00:05:42.810> practice<00:05:43.320> your<00:05:43.349> Barre<00:05:43.740> chords

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
so man practice your Barre chords

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.490 
so man practice your Barre chords
because<00:05:44.280> this<00:05:44.550> is<00:05:44.759> a<00:05:44.789> barre<00:05:45.090> chord<00:05:45.120> song<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.229> I

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
because this is a barre chord song and I

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.100 
because this is a barre chord song and I
guess<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:46.860> could<00:05:46.889> do<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.280> all<00:05:47.729> open<00:05:48.270> ones<00:05:48.479> it

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
guess you could do it all open ones it

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.410 
guess you could do it all open ones it
would<00:05:49.229> be<00:05:49.320> pretty<00:05:49.560> tough<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.130> change<00:05:50.460> but

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:05.380 

if<00:05:54.780> you<00:05:54.900> want<00:05:55.140> to<00:05:55.260> do<00:05:55.410> open<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:57.530> guess<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:58.650> works

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:25.980 

and<00:06:06.390> then<00:06:06.590> let's<00:06:07.590> just<00:06:07.650> do<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.980> course

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.299 

just<00:06:26.990> a<00:06:27.050> lot<00:06:27.259> of<00:06:27.289> chord<00:06:27.590> changes<00:06:27.949> doing<00:06:28.159> that

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:28.309 
just a lot of chord changes doing that

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:29.920 
just a lot of chord changes doing that
so<00:06:28.460> I<00:06:28.699> think<00:06:28.759> bar<00:06:29.210> chords<00:06:29.569> are<00:06:29.659> a<00:06:29.719> little

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
so I think bar chords are a little

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.230 
so I think bar chords are a little
easier<00:06:30.259> but<00:06:30.529> do<00:06:31.309> what<00:06:31.460> you<00:06:31.490> like<00:06:31.759> it's<00:06:32.059> just

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
easier but do what you like it's just

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.719 
easier but do what you like it's just
music<00:06:32.509> there<00:06:33.020> are<00:06:33.080> no<00:06:33.259> rules<00:06:33.550> alright<00:06:34.550> guys

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729
