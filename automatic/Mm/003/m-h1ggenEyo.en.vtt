this<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:06.330> we<00:00:06.390> need<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.990> start<00:00:07.230> our<00:00:07.500> design

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
this is how we need to start our design

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.280 
this is how we need to start our design
with<00:00:08.430> your<00:00:08.790> name<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.960> could<00:00:10.170> do<00:00:10.260> a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
with your name and you could do a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.770 
with your name and you could do a
signature<00:00:10.740> kind<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.849> like<00:00:12.059> Alberto

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
signature kind of like Alberto

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.400

first thing you're going to do and we're
going<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.690> fold<00:00:18.930> your<00:00:19.560> square<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.670> two<00:00:21.480> three

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
going to fold your square one two three

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.950 
going to fold your square one two three
we're<00:00:23.520> starting<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.300> writing<00:00:24.779> our<00:00:24.930> names

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we're starting with writing our names

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.099 
we're starting with writing our names
and<00:00:25.380> pencil<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> us<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.880> using<00:00:27.180> some<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and pencil some of us are using some of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.380 
and pencil some of us are using some of
our<00:00:28.349> seniors<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.920> walk<00:00:29.130> levers<00:00:29.550> added<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
our seniors and walk levers added a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.590 
our seniors and walk levers added a
signature<00:00:30.800> registration

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
signature registration

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.479 
signature registration
finding<00:00:33.600> status<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.680> once<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> name

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
finding status so once you have a name

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.180 
finding status so once you have a name
then<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> trace<00:00:36.840> over<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.739> name

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
then you get to trace over the name

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.119 
then you get to trace over the name
we're<00:00:38.670> tracing<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.510> around<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.739> piece<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
we're tracing it around the piece of

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.100 
we're tracing it around the piece of
paper<00:00:41.309> here's<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.450> thing<00:00:42.780> we're<00:00:42.960> gonna

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
paper here's the thing we're gonna

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.040 
paper here's the thing we're gonna
really<00:00:43.440> work<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.860> today<00:00:44.300> radial<00:00:45.300> symmetry

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
really work on today radial symmetry

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.190 
really work on today radial symmetry
hold<00:00:46.890> radial<00:00:47.340> symmetry<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:48.059> where<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.960> have

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
hold radial symmetry is where you have

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.950 
hold radial symmetry is where you have
the<00:00:49.559> point<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> middle<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.390> kind<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the point in the middle and kind of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160 
the point in the middle and kind of
everything<00:00:52.379> comes<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> point<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
everything comes out from that point so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.150 
everything comes out from that point so
it<00:00:55.199> makes<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.129> circle<00:00:56.780> governance<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:58.710> name<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it makes a circle governance my name is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.100 
it makes a circle governance my name is
Amit<00:01:00.800> sometimes<00:01:01.800> things<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.539> make<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Amit sometimes things can like make a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
Amit sometimes things can like make a
different<00:01:04.589> shape<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:05.070> pattern

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
different shape and pattern

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
different shape and pattern
the<00:01:06.780> only<00:01:06.990> thing<00:01:07.290> looks<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.650> our<00:01:07.860> names<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the only thing looks like our names and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
the only thing looks like our names and
what<00:01:08.700> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.030> looks<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.570> design<00:01:09.960> assume

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
what kind of looks like a design assume

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.429 
what kind of looks like a design assume
chairs<00:01:11.040> tending<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.760> design<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.320> of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
chairs tending to design this is kind of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
chairs tending to design this is kind of
art<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.799> were<00:01:14.299> transforming<00:01:15.299> turning

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
art that were transforming turning

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.280 
art that were transforming turning
something<00:01:16.920> into<00:01:17.310> another<00:01:18.240> thing<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
something into another thing when you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
something into another thing when you
have<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> names<00:01:20.159> together<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:21.360> kind<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
have all the names together it kind of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.429 
have all the names together it kind of
creates<00:01:22.170> something<00:01:22.380> abstract<00:01:23.030> it's<00:01:24.030> not

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
creates something abstract it's not

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:32.149 
creates something abstract it's not
necessarily<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> picture<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.220> anything<00:01:31.159> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
when you want to fold it you can sort of
