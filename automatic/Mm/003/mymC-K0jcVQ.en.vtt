create a big rock tone and basically if

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.350 
create a big rock tone and basically if
you<00:00:48.020> roll<00:00:48.260> back<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.650> volume<00:00:48.940> change<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.150> tone

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
you roll back the volume change the tone

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.750 
you roll back the volume change the tone
ever<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:50.720> slightly<00:00:50.990> you<00:00:51.800> can<00:00:51.950> get<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.130> real<00:00:52.460> good

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
ever so slightly you can get a real good

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.250 
ever so slightly you can get a real good
range<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.120> tones<00:00:53.390> out<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.630> it<00:00:53.900> so<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:54.200> not

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
range of tones out of it so it's not

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.120 
range of tones out of it so it's not
necessarily<00:00:54.980> just<00:00:55.010> for<00:00:55.780> rockers<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:57.040> think<00:00:58.040> the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
necessarily just for rockers I think the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.380 
necessarily just for rockers I think the
thing<00:00:58.280> that's<00:00:58.310> kept<00:00:58.670> me<00:00:58.760> going<00:00:58.970> back<00:00:59.210> to
