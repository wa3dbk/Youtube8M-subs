outside<00:00:07.170> meteor<00:00:07.620> falls<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> entrance

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
outside meteor falls in the entrance

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.400 
outside meteor falls in the entrance
side<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> Falla<00:00:09.389> portal<00:00:09.840> rustboro

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
side of the Falla portal rustboro

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.470 
side of the Falla portal rustboro
entrance<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> bit<00:00:11.250> different<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:11.700> I'm<00:00:12.150> at

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
entrance is a bit different so I'm at

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.240 
entrance is a bit different so I'm at
the<00:00:12.570> Falla<00:00:12.780> both<00:00:13.049> side<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.500> meteor<00:00:13.769> falls<00:00:14.040> so

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the Falla both side of meteor falls so

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.620 
the Falla both side of meteor falls so
first<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.580> all<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.790> get<00:00:14.910> two<00:00:15.150> meteor<00:00:15.389> falls

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
first of all you get two meteor falls

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.990 
first of all you get two meteor falls
and<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.320> need<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.619> have<00:00:16.800> HMO<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> waterfall

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and you need to have HMO a waterfall

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
and you need to have HMO a waterfall
without<00:00:18.240> waterfall<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.750> cannot<00:00:19.230> catch<00:00:19.500> Bagon

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
without waterfall you cannot catch Bagon

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
without waterfall you cannot catch Bagon
so<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.189> must<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.359> 8th<00:00:21.660> gym<00:00:22.050> leader

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
so you must be at the 8th gym leader

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.720 
so you must be at the 8th gym leader
Wallace<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.830> order<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.460> let's<00:00:23.609> go

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
Wallace in order to that so let's go

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.710 
Wallace in order to that so let's go
ahead<00:00:23.939> inside<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:25.439> cave<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> just

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
ahead inside the cave right now and just

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
ahead inside the cave right now and just
keep<00:00:27.960> walking<00:00:28.109> down<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.039> pretty

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
keep walking down here it's pretty

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.310 
keep walking down here it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.510> i<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.900> bagon<00:00:31.019> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
straightforward but i think bagon is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.830 
straightforward but i think bagon is
kind<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> raider<00:00:31.980> rare<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> catch<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.329> that's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
kind of raider rare to catch so that's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.549 
kind of raider rare to catch so that's
the<00:00:33.989> hardest<00:00:34.230> part

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the hardest part

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.170 
the hardest part
finding<00:00:35.070> Bagon<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.520> let's<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.760> into<00:00:35.910> water

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
finding Bagon so let's go into water

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
finding Bagon so let's go into water
here<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.590> let's<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.800> ahead<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.340> climb<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
here and let's go ahead and climb this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.810 
here and let's go ahead and climb this
giant<00:00:39.180> waterfall<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> quite<00:00:41.489> annoying

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
giant waterfall so it is quite annoying

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.840 
giant waterfall so it is quite annoying
that<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.510> only<00:00:42.629> catch<00:00:42.899> bagon<00:00:43.730> after<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that you can only catch bagon after the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.400 
that you can only catch bagon after the
8th<00:00:45.030> stream<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.690> does<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.289> make

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
8th stream but it does kind of make

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.709 
8th stream but it does kind of make
sense<00:00:46.469> since<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.489> Salamence<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
sense since the Salamence is the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
sense since the Salamence is the
strongest<00:00:49.140> ho<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> dragon<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> game<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
strongest ho and dragon in the game just

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.279 
strongest ho and dragon in the game just
like<00:00:50.850> dragon<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.690> only<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.140> these

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
like dragon that you can only get these

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
like dragon that you can only get these
strongest<00:00:52.739> ones<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.610> end<00:00:53.820> game<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.090> course

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
strongest ones in the end game of course

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.779 
strongest ones in the end game of course
but<00:00:55.320> anyways<00:00:55.620> let's<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:55.980> ahead<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
but anyways let's go ahead and use the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
but anyways let's go ahead and use the
surf<00:00:57.000> here

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
surf here

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.750 
surf here
you<00:00:58.829> didn't<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> walk<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> way

you didn't have to walk all the way
around<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.390> could<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.780> served

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
part right now if I can get big on if I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
part right now if I can get big on if I
don't<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.460> big<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.149> oh<00:01:45.329> no<00:01:45.840> never

behind<00:01:46.470> big<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.490> thought

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
behind big on is right here I thought

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
behind big on is right here I thought
they'd<00:01:48.360> gone<00:01:48.479> what's<00:01:48.689> gonna<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.899> rare<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
they'd gone what's gonna be rare but I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289 
they'd gone what's gonna be rare but I
guess<00:01:49.649> big<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.640> rare<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:50.939> either<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
guess big on is not as rare or either I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
guess big on is not as rare or either I
just<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.689> lucky<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.170> shot<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.649> best

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
just got lucky in one shot there best

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.010 
just got lucky in one shot there best
