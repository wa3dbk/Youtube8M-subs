 people were not even known yet 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.740
 the two of them were very happy with their 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.740
 professional choices 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.059
 in the midst of a search for work that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.300
 This sense of bringing oneself down 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.160
 in the course of image consulting 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.900
 it was in this course that we heard that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 This profession is more for those who like 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.880
 foot and shoes for two. 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.779
 at different times this phrase that the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 eureka

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.059
 back to host this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 new profession 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.969
 we worked separately from each other 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.579
 your way 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.530
 on a trip we met in his 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.210
 way of working from one 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.280
 we decided to work together 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.260
 an indication of a new customer and people 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.640
 solved together to experiment 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.070
 this way of working in double 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.559
 joining the two intelligences that in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.770
 May 2003 after feeling no more 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.420
 they collapse 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 in these ten years of style workshop already 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.920

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 with 55 more companies a project 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 totally thought only for her 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 the people from the beginning opted for 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 working with real-life women with 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.430
 real bodies normal careers but 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.240
 always in the mood to put out 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.790
 that in relation to the inside for us clothes 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 hair accessory makeup or any 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.990
 other thing that is related to 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.670
 appearance is a communication tool and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.439
 cement that we can meet for 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 show the world that we are 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.360
 in 2006, we began to divide the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.490
 tester experiences on the internet a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.409
 informal way and people like 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.810
 the people 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.249
 This is the way to talk about 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.170
 fashion for real life as if people 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.420
 she was sitting on the couch of each 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.280
 of the readers we have uploaded to all 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.929
 the social networks that today have added 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.670
 over 90,000 women every day is 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.459
 Because we talk to so many 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.619
 women of all ages professions 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.149
 lives hobbs so different that we 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.939
 began to realize some issues 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.609
 common problems related to self-esteem and 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.810
 quality of life, we realized that 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.000
 to mess around in the wardrobe 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.810
 to rethink life and we saw ourselves as 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.610
 because wardrobe therapists in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.709
 finally, who does not like 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.780
 You need to consume so much and becomes the 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.700
 instead of just having people want the world 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.049
 to be able to replace consumption by 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.049
 self esteem for truth
