00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 a school party that ended in a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.490
 violation that is the accusation against 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.710
 of four German school students 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.389
 they would have attacked in 2011 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.179
 sexually a schoolmate 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.420
 of 16 years according to the complaint filed 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.279
 by the parents of the alleged victim 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 one of the assumptions involved would be 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 son of an embassy official 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.390
 German and would be protected by 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 diplomatic immunity the complaint goes on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 against those who are responsible 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.050
 and ak and responsible at least four 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.899
 classmates only one of them 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 would enjoy diplomatic immunity and if it is 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.800
 the case is going to have to be tried in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.390
 germany but the other three to have 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.070
 to be tried in Chile in case 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 continue the investigation is difficult 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.239
 this young man is part of the process 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 his immunity and the experts explain 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.780
 that it is also difficult to be judged 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.820
 in germany since all the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.949
 background of the investigation are 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.199
 in our country together unthinkable the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.660
 point of view of a reasonable inquiry 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.000
 penal 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.620
 that can be sanctioned in Germany and 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.080
 follow and apply in substantive laws 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.850
 German to an investigation 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.229
 necessarily in Chile another of the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.540
 options would be that the German justice 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.240
 sent an emissary to do the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.390
 field investigations but that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.979
 German representative could not apply for 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.619
 yes as the city or life of our 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.970
 public skills of a sexual nature or 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.390
 reconstitution character skills 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.890
 of scene photographic experts 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.930
 statements could not a difficult case 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.149
 and in which until now there is only 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.790
 a complaint the German embassy in a 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.979
 email to cnn chile was limited 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.250
 to say that the claim as such does not

 it is involved in parallel 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.770
 that really is a new subject theme 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.539
 new but reality that is old a 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.050
 ancient reality that today is 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.340
 denouncing more frequently
