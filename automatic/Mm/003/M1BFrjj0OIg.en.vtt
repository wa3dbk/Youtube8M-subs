00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 challenging for taking turns in 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.460
 Contrary to the school age of the certain 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 Reiz one gets to know many new people 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.969
 I did a lesson because I did that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.250
 really want to learn me 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.250
 he is interested in fun 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.360
 and do teach and matura and with too 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.010
 that really really great 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.410
 I did not just school 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 because I wanted to earn money on the side 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 and also learn from what also for 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.110
 you know do 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.000
 I just love it better when I am 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.290
 try things and make yourself 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.290
 So I am deeply learned 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.140
 the entrance exam is not easy 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.390
 I have 1200 apprentices at that time 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:01.260
 looked at under 100 be on 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:02.190
 every case was for the recording 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.160
 you have to bring 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.160
 technical interest self-confidence 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 independence 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.880
 in the beginning it was the hardest to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.880
 First time a customer talks 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.750
 because the fear is something wrong 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.750
 say 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.180
 first customer looked very stupid where 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.180
 a girl 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.500
 if it came then 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.640
 the best moment in the apprenticeship until 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.640
 Now female massively rising 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.750
 many of us do not have that feasible 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.790
 is because I'm proud of it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.860
 that's why he starts at 1 when you start 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.000
 the teaching always of the future chances 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.000
 mostly the sun 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.870
 you can so you can rate remains 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.670
 if you work hard enough even 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.479
 it will be regional leaders 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.479
 interested in something
