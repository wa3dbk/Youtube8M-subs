00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
know the caterpillars then become

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.090 
know the caterpillars then become
butterflies<00:00:33.290> fYI<00:00:34.290> these<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
butterflies fYI these are really the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
butterflies fYI these are really the
only<00:00:35.130> insects<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.030> stomach<00:00:36.410> now

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
only insects I can stomach now

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
only insects I can stomach now
butterflies<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.460> spectacular<00:00:38.730> they're

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
butterflies are just spectacular they're

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.229 
butterflies are just spectacular they're
beautiful<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.649> caterpillars<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.430> through<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
beautiful and caterpillars go through a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.190 
beautiful and caterpillars go through a
series<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.750> stages<00:00:43.230> known<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.160> stars<00:00:45.200> and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
series of stages known as in stars and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.619 
series of stages known as in stars and
that's<00:00:46.500> how<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.920> become<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> butterfly<00:00:47.879> then

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that's how they become a butterfly then

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
that's how they become a butterfly then
they<00:00:48.750> stay<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.200> pupa<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.700> that's

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
they stay in a pupa you know that's

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.420 
they stay in a pupa you know that's
where<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.230> amorphous<00:00:52.739> size<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
where they go to then amorphous size and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.860 
where they go to then amorphous size and
so<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.640> beautiful<00:00:54.360> butterflies

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so these beautiful butterflies

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
so these beautiful butterflies
necessarily<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> monarch<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.430> endangered

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
necessarily the monarch is endangered

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.580 
necessarily the monarch is endangered
and<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.750> Queen<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.109> Checkerspot<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:59.579> also

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
and the Queen on Checkerspot is also

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
and the Queen on Checkerspot is also
however<00:01:01.590> their<00:01:01.949> numbers<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.640> actually

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
however their numbers are actually

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.289 
however their numbers are actually
improving<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.470> there's<00:01:05.280> also<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.939> SH<00:01:05.970> louse

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
improving and there's also the SH louse

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.330 
improving and there's also the SH louse
shallow<00:01:07.170> tail<00:01:07.560> butterfly<00:01:08.330> now<00:01:09.330> these<00:01:09.810> are

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
shallow tail butterfly now these are

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.570 
shallow tail butterfly now these are
