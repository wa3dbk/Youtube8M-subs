gluing up to do this week making you

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.290 
gluing up to do this week making you
stable<00:00:07.730> so<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.179> little

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
stable so this video is a little

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.120 
stable so this video is a little
different<00:00:09.469> I'm<00:00:10.469> gonna<00:00:10.620> show<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.099> I

different I'm gonna show you what I
decided<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.090> think<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> best<00:00:12.750> way<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> glue

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
decided I think is the best way to glue

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.530 
decided I think is the best way to glue
up<00:00:13.230> these<00:00:13.469> tabletops<00:00:14.299> obviously<00:00:15.299> I've<00:00:15.420> got

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
up these tabletops obviously I've got

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.560 
up these tabletops obviously I've got
everything<00:00:15.809> prepped<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.500> I'm<00:00:17.039> gonna<00:00:17.480> put<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
everything prepped and I'm gonna put the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.679 
everything prepped and I'm gonna put the
boards<00:00:18.840> together<00:00:19.070> glue<00:00:20.070> em<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:21.000> then<00:00:21.150> they're

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
boards together glue em and then they're

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.090 
boards together glue em and then they're
just<00:00:21.750> rough<00:00:22.109> cut<00:00:22.320> right<00:00:22.500> now<00:00:22.619> I'm<00:00:22.769> gonna<00:00:22.890> cut

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
just rough cut right now I'm gonna cut

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.880 
just rough cut right now I'm gonna cut
out<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.400> final<00:00:24.029> size<00:00:24.210> later<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.720> that's<00:00:25.619> all

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
out the final size later so that's all

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.929 
out the final size later so that's all
you<00:00:26.130> know

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
you know

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
you know
figure<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.779> let's<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.439> what

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
figure that out but let's show you what

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.250 
figure that out but let's show you what
I'm<00:00:28.619> doing<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.789> off<00:00:30.050> wearing<00:00:31.050> gloves

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I'm doing first off wearing gloves

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.359 
I'm doing first off wearing gloves
because<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.769> start<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.130> blisters

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
because you start to get blisters

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.240 
because you start to get blisters
turning<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:32.940> those<00:00:33.090> clamps<00:00:33.710> love's<00:00:34.710> taken

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
turning all those clamps love's taken

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
turning all those clamps love's taken
off<00:00:35.340> by<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> wood<00:00:36.600> glue<00:00:36.750> by<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> gallon

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
off by the wood glue by the gallon

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.080 
off by the wood glue by the gallon
because<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.829> much<00:00:38.010> cheaper<00:00:40.969> probably<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
because it's much cheaper probably got a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.280 
because it's much cheaper probably got a
couple<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> these<00:00:42.510> laying<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
couple of these laying around you get a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.319 
couple of these laying around you get a
lot<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:46.160> in<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.309> old<00:00:47.489> paint<00:00:47.730> roller<00:00:48.059> I've

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
lot of all in this old paint roller I've

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
lot of all in this old paint roller I've
been<00:00:48.480> keeping<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.930> water<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.190> pull<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
been keeping in water and I just pull it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
been keeping in water and I just pull it
out<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> water<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.149> using<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
out of the water when I'm using it it is

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.510 
out of the water when I'm using it it is
like<00:00:52.020> new<00:00:52.199> every<00:00:52.440> time<00:00:52.649> I've<00:00:52.890> used<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> lot

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
I found the most efficient way here I'm

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.569 
I found the most efficient way here I'm
basically<00:01:01.649> cleaning<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.010> two<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.280> fours<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
basically cleaning up two by fours the

basically cleaning up two by fours the
most<00:01:02.760> efficient<00:01:03.000> way<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.390> I've<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.719> these<00:01:03.840> two

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
most efficient way is I've got these two

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.440 
most efficient way is I've got these two
