00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.430 
want for Christmas is you build up no no
is<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> detail<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.820> not<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> build<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is the detail it's not the build up the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.549 
is the detail it's not the build up the
bridge<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> pre-chorus<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.170> build<00:00:46.379> up

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
bridge or the pre-chorus is the build up

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
bridge or the pre-chorus is the build up
that<00:00:46.770> makes<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.370> chorus<00:00:47.730> sound<00:00:48.000> even<00:00:48.360> better

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that makes your chorus sound even better

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.420 
that makes your chorus sound even better
and<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.379> verse<00:00:49.680> bridge<00:00:50.070> chorus

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and if you have verse bridge chorus

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.709 
and if you have verse bridge chorus
verse<00:00:51.030> bridge<00:00:51.420> chorus<00:00:52.489> then<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.239> tends<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
verse bridge chorus then that tends to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.229 
verse bridge chorus then that tends to
last<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.590> minutes<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> just

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
last about two minutes which if you just

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
last about two minutes which if you just
kept<00:00:57.510> chorus<00:00:58.079> chorus<00:00:58.289> chorus<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:59.070> for

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
kept chorus chorus chorus going for

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
kept chorus chorus chorus going for
another<00:00:59.609> minute<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.090> half<00:01:00.270> we've<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:01.079> one

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
another minute and a half we've got one

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.319 
another minute and a half we've got one
easy<00:01:01.530> well<00:01:02.129> yeah<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> would<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> little

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
easy well yeah but it would be a little

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
easy well yeah but it would be a little
bit<00:01:03.449> too<00:01:03.600> repetitive<00:01:04.159> that's<00:01:05.159> why<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.489> have

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
bit too repetitive that's why you have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
bit too repetitive that's why you have
your<00:01:05.880> middle<00:01:06.030> eights<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:07.080> America<00:01:07.590> known<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.890> a

bridge no no to make it last longer make

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
bridge no no to make it last longer make
it<00:01:11.729> last<00:01:11.909> longer<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.720> why<00:01:12.900> songs

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

last<00:01:13.409> three<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> half<00:01:13.890> minutes<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.460> general

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
last three and a half minutes in general

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.830 
last three and a half minutes in general
the<00:01:15.150> average<00:01:15.360> attention<00:01:15.659> span<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.500> humans<00:01:17.340> how

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
the average attention span of humans how

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.160 
the average attention span of humans how
it's<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.210> yeah

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it's it's just it's it's a little yeah

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:34.550 
it's it's just it's it's a little yeah
plant<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:24.770> yeah<00:01:31.460> because<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.560> think

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
plant and a little yeah because I think

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.170 
plant and a little yeah because I think
if<00:01:34.740> anything<00:01:35.130> they're<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.400> longer<00:01:35.640> Beatles

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
if anything they're going longer Beatles

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270 
if anything they're going longer Beatles
songs<00:01:36.450> were<00:01:36.600> always<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:37.110> two<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> half

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
songs were always like two and a half

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.289 
songs were always like two and a half
minutes<00:01:38.670> weren't<00:01:39.000> they

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
minutes weren't they

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.700 
minutes weren't they
so<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.750> any<00:01:39.900> fitness<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.590> got

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so I think if any fitness actually got

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
so I think if any fitness actually got
longer<00:01:40.950> okay<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.909> probably<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> pop

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
longer okay that's probably as a pop

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.280 
longer okay that's probably as a pop
music's<00:01:43.320> brought<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> bit
