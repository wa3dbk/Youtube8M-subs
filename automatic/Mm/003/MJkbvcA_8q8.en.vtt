so<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.890> an<00:01:33.979> OK<00:01:34.399> storyline<00:01:35.350> nothing<00:01:36.350> amazing

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
so it's an OK storyline nothing amazing

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.249 
so it's an OK storyline nothing amazing
but<00:01:37.700> interesting<00:01:38.390> enough<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:38.960> think<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
but interesting enough but I think the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.719 
but interesting enough but I think the
real<00:01:39.409> draw<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.860> book<00:01:40.009> is<00:01:40.130> meant<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.460> be<00:01:40.579> the

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
real draw of the book is meant to be the

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.740 
real draw of the book is meant to be the
narration<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.920> written<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.000> kind<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.509> a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
narration it is written in a kind of a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.539 
narration it is written in a kind of a
lemony<00:01:45.320> snicket<00:01:45.380> series<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.460> unfortunate

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
lemony snicket series of unfortunate

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.959 
lemony snicket series of unfortunate
events<00:01:47.140> style<00:01:48.140> but<00:01:48.799> for<00:01:48.979> me<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.340> really<00:01:49.520> did

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
events style but for me it really did

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.300 
events style but for me it really did
just<00:01:50.000> seem<00:01:50.450> quite<00:01:50.899> derivative<00:01:51.710> all<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
just seem quite derivative all the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.139 
just seem quite derivative all the
Lemony<00:01:52.610> Snicket<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.990> didn't<00:01:54.439> seem<00:01:54.680> like<00:01:55.219> they

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
Lemony Snicket it didn't seem like they

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.319 
Lemony Snicket it didn't seem like they
were<00:01:56.180> trying<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.990> use<00:01:57.799> their<00:01:58.039> own<00:01:58.250> voice<00:01:58.700> it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
interesting I think a lot of children to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.700 
interesting I think a lot of children to
be<00:02:29.180> able<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.510> relate<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.870> those<00:02:30.110> characters

more and the stories are much more your

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.680 
more and the stories are much more your
sort<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.220> wild<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:34.910> adventurous<00:02:35.510> and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
sort of wild and adventurous and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.390 
sort of wild and adventurous and
interesting<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.710> want<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.160> know<00:02:37.220> what's

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
interesting you want to know what's

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.180 
interesting you want to know what's
going<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:39.830> little

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
going on and in this it was a little

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
going on and in this it was a little
lackluster

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
lackluster

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.060 
lackluster
and<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.510> know<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:41.840> unfair<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> keep<00:02:42.500> comparing

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
and I know it's unfair to keep comparing

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.580 
and I know it's unfair to keep comparing
the<00:02:43.190> two<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.180> really<00:02:44.450> did<00:02:44.780> feel<00:02:45.050> like<00:02:45.080> that

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
the two but it really did feel like that

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.650 
the two but it really did feel like that
is<00:02:45.860> what<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.340> book<00:02:46.520> was<00:02:46.580> trying<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.360> achieve

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
is what this book was trying to achieve

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.120 
is what this book was trying to achieve
and<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.740> just<00:02:48.980> didn't<00:02:49.460> get<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:51.620> me<00:02:51.830> a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
and it just didn't get there for me a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.060 
and it just didn't get there for me a
good<00:02:52.460> children's<00:02:52.940> book<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.420> one<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.410> can

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
good children's book is one that I can

an adult and I didn't mind this book it
was<00:03:02.060> fine<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.690> was<00:03:02.720> easy<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.380> through<00:03:03.650> but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
was fine it was easy to get through but

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.590 
was fine it was easy to get through but
it<00:03:05.440> wasn't<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:07.370> great<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:08.030> would<00:03:08.360> suggest

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
it wasn't that great I would suggest

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.560 
it wasn't that great I would suggest
that<00:03:09.230> small<00:03:10.070> children<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.670> did<00:03:11.180> enjoy<00:03:11.540> a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
that small children that did enjoy a

looking<00:03:13.460> for<00:03:13.670> more<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.180> very<00:03:14.960> inclusive

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
looking for more of that very inclusive

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.400 
looking for more of that very inclusive
narration<00:03:16.400> feel<00:03:18.190> then<00:03:19.270> maybe<00:03:20.270> give<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.350> a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
narration feel then maybe give this a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.440 
narration feel then maybe give this a
chance<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:22.160> really<00:03:22.280> do<00:03:22.700> just<00:03:22.730> feel<00:03:23.120> like<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.390> was

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
chance I really do just feel like it was

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.820 
chance I really do just feel like it was
trying<00:03:23.630> for<00:03:23.960> something<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.560> didn't

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
others in the series which is sad

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.449 
others in the series which is sad
because<00:03:29.780> I'm<00:03:29.959> always<00:03:30.110> excited<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.800> read<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> new

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.370 
because I'm always excited to read a new
good<00:03:31.730> children's<00:03:32.209> series<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.080> just

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
good children's series that this just

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.560 
good children's series that this just
fell<00:03:34.010> short<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.489> mark<00:03:34.520> for<00:03:34.940> me<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.239> those

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
fell short of the mark for me so those

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.330 
fell short of the mark for me so those
are<00:03:35.750> my<00:03:35.870> thoughts<00:03:36.050> on<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.620> Templeton<00:03:36.980> twins

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340

are my thoughts on the Templeton twins
have<00:03:37.670> an<00:03:37.790> idea<00:03:38.709> if<00:03:39.709> this<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.489> still<00:03:40.820> currently

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
have an idea if this is still currently

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.190 
have an idea if this is still currently
available<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:43.370> cheap<00:03:43.670> price<00:03:44.080> for<00:03:45.080> a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
available for a cheap price for a

available for a cheap price for a
readers<00:03:45.620> then<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.280> don't<00:03:47.150> know<00:03:47.209> if<00:03:47.390> maybe<00:03:47.630> if
