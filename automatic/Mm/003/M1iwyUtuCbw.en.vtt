00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Carolina one time just like this I'm

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900 
Carolina one time just like this I'm
going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> go<00:00:52.829> through<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> inside<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.670> can't

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
going to go through the inside we can't

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.450 
going to go through the inside we can't
line<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
line just like that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so you gonna make a loop around it like

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.689 
so you gonna make a loop around it like
that<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> go<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.070> another<00:01:02.399> tight

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that and then you go make another tight

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880 
that and then you go make another tight
loop<00:01:02.910> around<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.359> front<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:03.899> I'm

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
loop around the front like this I'm

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.649 
loop around the front like this I'm
going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> loop<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:06.210> you're<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.510> go

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
going to loop and then you're gonna go

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.560 
going to loop and then you're gonna go
through<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.700> little<00:01:09.409> open<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.740> made

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570
