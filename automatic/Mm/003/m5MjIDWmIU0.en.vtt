particularly after you kind of went back

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.990 
particularly after you kind of went back
to<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.660> last<00:02:39.870> half<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.350> season<00:02:40.820> went<00:02:41.820> back

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
to a more traditional kind of offense

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.380 
to a more traditional kind of offense
that<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.950> weren't<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.580> big<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.000> needed<00:02:45.210> to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
that you weren't as big as you needed to
