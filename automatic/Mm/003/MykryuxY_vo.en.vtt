00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:08.660
 All big hello in this video, I tell you 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.800
 I'll tell you how to clean the kettle from 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.960
 scum 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.110
 no matter electric kettle or lausanne 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.000
 we see a teapot for our teapot already for 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.339
 time 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.159
 scum formed somewhere like this 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.989
 batur me she is with us 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.589
 clean we will be using lemon 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.749
 acids 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.640
 I tried a lot of tools but it 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:36.920
 the remedy is the best since she 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.690
 is the most so neutral that's not 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.850
 harmful therefore we will honor by 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.830
 citric acid we take water 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.280
 a little more than the level where we 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.470
 there is a cap, we have something like this 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.440
 Now we are entering now for the water party 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.240
 I scored got to water and with such 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.260
 considering we will do here with us 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.750
 a half liter of water now 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:09.159
 tablespoon of citric acid per liter 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:12.920
 water here and a half tablespoons of citric acid 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.520
 I poured and now turn it on 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.520
 boils 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.380
 see our kettle is now boiling and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 now that's when it boils we need 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
 hold the switch for a little bit so he 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 longer boiled on the usual 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.340
 in order to better it all boiled down 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.100
 there citric acid well worth doing it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.070
 not more than 10 seconds otherwise 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.220
 electric kettle then it can just burn 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.820
 if you remark to him that he should 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.030
 to boil 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.250
 then we put it on at least 10 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 he should be on little fire little by little 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.080
 on the sly boil 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.429
 digested in citric acid here 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:01.759
 Apparently he boils I will throw off the handle 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.759
 until shutdown and now hold 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.070
 enough 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.130
 I've had five minutes and now I'm 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.490
 I turn it on again waiting for it to boil and 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.670
 so do 3-4 times that is a little bit he 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.590
 cools off letting go five will quit 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.340
 then leave again and then we will 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.760
 merge well that's all I did a couple of times 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.920
 such a procedure now I pour out the water with 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.530
 him and show you that he is really well 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.980
 inside clean outside we can wash 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.840
 its any detergent what we have 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.400
 there are all my friends 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.950
 I can only show you what 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:03:01.010
 inside here it is clear we see no how it was 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.900
 he has a scum kettle clean then not 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.560
 a cape on the visible from the belly gleams it 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.930
 just given such on around those on so he 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.330
 completely clean here and now place 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 so much wash it outside and in advance 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.950
 so that our teapot glistens I say it again 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.350
 if you have a gas kettle just 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.080
 leave it at a minimum that is it 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.930
 boil steel at least gas and minutes 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.170
 ten so that it boils and everything with the expectation 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.240
 tablespoon to 1 liter of water like this 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.100
 here is a simple way and inexpensive you can 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.720
 descale the kettle 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.720
 thank you all for watching
