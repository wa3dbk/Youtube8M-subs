automatically based on location and time
of<00:01:21.030> day<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.600> could<00:01:22.080> set<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.799> convert<00:01:23.759> over

to that rather than have this in the
daytime<00:01:27.320> say<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.710> could<00:01:28.979> set<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
daytime say you know you could set it to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.649 
daytime say you know you could set it to
kick<00:01:30.390> over<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> Eclipse<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.390> like

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
kick over on the Eclipse you know like

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
kick over on the Eclipse you know like
at<00:01:33.840> eight<00:01:34.079> thirty<00:01:34.140> nine<00:01:34.710> o'clock<00:01:35.070> or

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
at eight thirty nine o'clock or
something<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> would<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.360> doing<00:01:36.930> black

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
something then it would be doing black

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.190 
something then it would be doing black
until<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.189> 5am<00:01:38.880> or<00:01:39.299> six<00:01:39.570> a.m.<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
until like 5am or six a.m. in the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
until like 5am or six a.m. in the
morning<00:01:40.530> whenever<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.280> gets<00:01:41.430> daylight<00:01:41.909> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
morning whenever it gets daylight that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.050 
morning whenever it gets daylight that
would<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.479> awesome<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> developer<00:01:43.829> is

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
would be awesome if the developer is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.249 
would be awesome if the developer is
listening<00:01:45.060> than<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.360> takes<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.780> few<00:01:45.990> notes

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
listening than one takes a few notes

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.190 
listening than one takes a few notes
with<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.399> great<00:01:47.820> but

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
with that that would be great but

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
with that that would be great but
overall<00:01:49.200> guys<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.850> great

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.109 
overall guys I think this is a great
week<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.710> whenever<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.250> install<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.759> you'll

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
week but whenever you install it you'll

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.499 
week but whenever you install it you'll
have<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.540> remember<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.729> close

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
have to remember that you have to close

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.950
