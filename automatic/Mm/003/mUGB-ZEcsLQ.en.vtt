00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.449
 so last time we were made 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.230
 boom bench this time we will do 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.119
 the bar itself and so this we need 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.289
 two forms specifically for clay 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.289
 I took an iron sheet 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.989
 measured in width 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 10 centimeters cut off stapled 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.690
 rivet and strengthen this whole thing 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.350
 wire well to bling case of impact 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.300
 about the earth is not broken this whole thing will 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.120
 pour concrete 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 you are here is we need are here 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 tubes specifically for the neck if we put 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.960
 and the hall im the result it will look 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.990
 more professionally I will become like this 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.340
 Well, and the reef itself , our neck will be like 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.909
 times the suitable diameter for the rod 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.909
 i size did it meter eighty 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.509
 paste form on a flat surface and 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.450
 exactly in the center 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:41.090
 we expose these tubes 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:46.500
 the whole thing can be measured with a tape measure 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.230
 clearly exactly and so mixed in his concrete 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.260
 stirred 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.330
 now we will fill the lengths so we 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.940
 flooded 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.840
 Clay solution is now waiting until 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.460
 dry out and water every day 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:10.200
 Somewhere before, this is exactly ours. 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:16.680
 pancakes are already dry and that's what happened 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.210
 of them I have already planted them on the neck 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.100
 on the reef itself 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:27.600
 did measure equal distance secured 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.910
 how to say stalled length not to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.430
 stuck in the middle and on this side 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.140
 same 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.070
 the lengths I got are ninety 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.500
 four kilograms it without vulture vulture I 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.030
 I did not weigh but I think kilogram 5 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.280
 will pull exactly all friends subscribe 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.070
 put the likes on the channel 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.330
 stay tuned next next 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.830
 time we will do homemade dumbbells 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.830
 good luck to everyone, great success in sport
