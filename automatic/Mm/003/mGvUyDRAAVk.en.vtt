00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.100
 I am I have to be killer 7 this is my 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.310
 second creepy pasta is about the 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.560
 cursed cartridge of resident evil 2 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.620
 I hope you like it without saying more 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.349
 until the next hello my name is jaime 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.419
 Hernandez 3 years ago I spent 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.329
 stuck to the video games had a 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.269
 nintendo 64 I still remember the hours that 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:28.539
 I had fun playing cell super Mario 64 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.640
 and not to mention Castlevania had so many 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.890
 cartridges that could swim in them the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.109
 most repeated but I collected them 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.120
 I just needed to get the resident 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.420
 evil 2 that was my favorite and I already 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.430
 had played with other friends one day at 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.500
 leaving high school walking 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.480
 quietly home I found myself at a 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.489
 street vendor with a big beard and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.070
 hood that brought a bag full of 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.929
 cartridges I could not contain the desire well 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.789
 I approached him and asked if he brought 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.160
 the 'resident evil' that he longed for and 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.719
 he told me of course of course take and take 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.730
 a cartridge that already looked very 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.399
 discolored and had writing with down 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.590
 permanent blacksmiths never judge sebum 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.690
 caregiver then continued saying the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.420
 game is in Portuguese but 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.370
 for God's sake do not play the mode 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.830
 that follows from real survival and remembers 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.110
 little friend the curiosity killed the cat and he 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.600
 was walking I did not pay much attention and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.000
 I ran when I got home 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.790
 I went running to connect my nintendo 64 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.890
 to load the game at the beginning gave 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.990
 problems to be able to reproduce it because 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.180
 not blowing it worked but after 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.800
 of about 25 attempts at last I was 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.080
 running but the eye of the menu 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.270
 main blinking it made me something 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.160
 weird but I did not give much importance anymore 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.320
 when I was going to choose a level of 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.450
 difficulty of the red title was beginning to 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.010
 slide inside the screen like 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.050
 if it were blood to paint 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.480
 completely the menu and could not choose 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.210
 nothing turned on and turn off the console and 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.400
 again happened I repeated the procedure and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.410
 I said the third one is the defeated if not 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.300
 it works I'll throw it in the trash for me 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.610
 bad luck this time the title will 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.680
 I was spreading upwards as if he knew 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.020
 longing to play and the eye in the background 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.729
 it was completely closed as when 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.300
 someone is asleep was my opportunity 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.670
 and I quickly went to choose the level 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.000
 I was elf 6 that I think it was easy 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.090
 normal that was 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.860
 the true survival that was supplying the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.960
 real survival and there was a level of 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.180
 extra difficulty saying yoga I thought 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.850
 What a river that I could not translate because 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.920
 that my Portuguese is not very good as 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.200
 I'm very good at these games I decided 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.150
 start playing it in real survival but 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.820
 it was very easy for me and I committed the worst 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.280
 stupidity of my life and play that way 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.800
 yoga I thought that ribÃ©ry that I did not take the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.630
 task of translating the game did not let me 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.610
 choose the level of violence or the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.620
 color of blood as it always does 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.390
 and instead of the typical intro video that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.250
 it came out in the other levels it came out a 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.500
 video of ones as rituals modes 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.690
 satanic where there were skulls for all 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.810
 sides a pentagram with fire and a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.150
 n64 cartridge in between then it got 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.340
 the screen completely black then 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.160
 static like when we watch TV in a 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.780
 channel without signal and then left Leon 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.180
 Kennedy on a stage with black background 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.950
 where there was only one mirror by which 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.989
 it happened and when it came from the other side its 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.150
 hair was black and a screen came out 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.010
 that said his life is on the cliff 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.230
 after the wait appeared lion 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.870
 falling from a rough distance to 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.350
 one meter to the ground and it appeared in a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.450
 scene 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.370
 that was peculiar to me in which 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.650
 I watched an old wagon that had a 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.540
 chatting business while walking the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.820
 stage the houses became very 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.040
 known in that dogs came out 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.080
 peculiar zombie of the game that I 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.090
 they ran down that street until 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.520
 that I saw a door that could be opened already 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.470
 all hurry between the stage inside 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.720
 it looked like my house I thought it was 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.060
 simple coincidence so I went into what 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.190
 that looked like my room and there I watched 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.290
 on the screen grabbed control of the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.030
 nintendo when the window started 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.220
 to enter some dogs and zombies that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.470
 They bit my whole body and I felt 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.450
 bitten in the flesh with everything and 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.340
 pain that accompanied me I made the attempt 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.930
 to disconnect the console and only then 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.930
 stop the pain that caused me their 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.790
 bitten and I fainted the next day 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.770
 I woke up in the hospital with my parents 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.990
 worried asking what happened 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.030
 who wanted to kill me and I 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.400
 I told about the game but they judged me 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.440
 crazy six months later I recover from 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.810
 the tremendous and mysterious bites that 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.640
 they appeared out of nowhere I took a bat 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.860
 baseball and I ended up with my console without 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.139
 think twice now my parents 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.210
 they thought he was really crazy 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.180
 They gave me all my things and they put me in 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.280
 this asylum I ask you please the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.050
 way more would it be that if they find that 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.240
 cartridge burn it throw it to a 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.150
 gully do what you can by 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.039
 disappear it and well I'm off it's time to 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.990
 my sedative because only then can I 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.520
 fall asleep from that dark 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.520
 day that I lived three years ago
