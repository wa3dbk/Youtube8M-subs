00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.190
 new video for a new tutorial so 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.150
 first of all excused me for my voice I 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.490
 am a little sick 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.200
 these days so nothing very serious I 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.250
 so reassure you today we 're going 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.900
 look at this problem this crash of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.420
 battlefield 3 on a 67 70 m 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.740
 so first of all I had huge 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 problems so that's why I have 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.689
 not made of bf3 since very very 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.650
 long on my channel which I made 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 a last video 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.820
 not long ago since I have 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.530
 successful here is to solve this problem so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.760
 the problem is what is it that after 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.850
 a few minutes of play 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 so in battlefield 3 is well our 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.579
 game crash finally the image freezes and that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.579
 stop so I found a solution 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.980
 these seven drivers the catalyst 12.2 unifying 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.410
 lp5 strong switchable graphics 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.930
 you will tell me why this pilot 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.399
 just me I'll admit you that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 for a month I tried everything 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.769
 really even game I really thought 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 that the last 13 points 1 to the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.540
 correct a lot of things but nothing 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 all that nothing when I knew everything so I 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.720
 am really informed for a month 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.150
 I was looking I was looking I was looking 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 on forums and I found this famous 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.310
 driver the catalyst 12 points 2 you me 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 say it is old sight that dates 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.580
 that seem to me from the month of February or 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.000
 April or March 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.900
 I do not really know but all that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.299
 I can tell you that they are walking 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.920
 really here so I tried it and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.610
 walk is really I have more than 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.250
 crash problems 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.490
 so first of all you have to download it 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.049
 so you click on one of the three 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.149
 close links so that will be of course 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.590
 in the description once you 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.399
 have it download so you're going to have 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.070
 this is catalyst so you 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:57.000
 doubleclick and cathy 12.2 whql 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.250
 so we double click it must of course 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.380
 before all is installed its pilots 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.619
 so that's how we do it is enough 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.590
 to go in to uninstall or modify a 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.090
 program to remove amd catalyst 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.790
 installs manager then do a little 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.380
 really a little cleaning with driver 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.739
 sweeper or the river fusion 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.790
 heavily alpine and it's good so there 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.350
 you accept of course that's who 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 is done so here we say welcome and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.010
 so we press next again 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.620
 once on next again his 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.760
 text again on next there it's 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.080
 the way from where he will settle 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.180
 so I'm not going to install it 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.340
 that he is already there 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.530
 so basically this has extracted the little 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.980
 file 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.150
 that's what is done just show the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.790
 items questions on my desk and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:58.440
 then you will have that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.840
 12.2 whql hop here is then 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.790
 you click next 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.130
 installed and there you just have to 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.620
 install all this you click on 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.519
 next next next next and you 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.600
 install everything and it's all right 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.600
 that's what is done so it's a 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.420
 pretty brief tutorial but it serves to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.450
 a lot of people know it's really 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.160
 really really great i thank them 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.370

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.290
 the forum finally here it is so I share 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.500
 quite simply 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:35.060
 and that's what makes it so I hope it 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.130
 will help you especially do not forget 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.489
