00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.250
 we demand their rights "he can not leave himself 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.590
 Roadway 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.889
 raa / ap the value is important was the spirit they could be the striker that is 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 a factions that are just that which are the scenes attracted and then have 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.650
 we still have the excerpt here 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.970
 Percent of the remaining parties and are the same - and lost 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.740
 the so a bit scared normal US military race a lot of green Como 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.689
 Exactly my thing and I have also decided for that and stupid me too 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.420
 but also okay then you can play Kik together because that 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.790
 Problem with the supplements 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.010
 that would be per cent you decide for fish Iwona parties so speak 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.829
 Oil Company plays Werner but he prefers to practice 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.390
 then the side by side fight both committed and binding for 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 The situation under control also does not change so easily 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.070
 That is now the first game had to feel for the quasi drive 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.500
 that's just tears 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.380
 because you only fight within your own party as it still is 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.750
 no real opponent 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.510
 and that's a classic percent team Deathmatch Voest bypasses 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.650
 who simply shut away the opponents divis Bonn tickets that they got from 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.600
 at the top of this energy bar 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 b 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.380
 Everyone who has seen percent will soon be rewarded above all for that 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.780
 defensively playing defeated 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.960
 works well in a team 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.560
 So if you highlight fallen colleagues around then there is neat 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 experience 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.600
 her comrades mountain 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.610
 exactly and for his various points 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 Percent, of course, there is also a lot of piety 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 our vehicles were exactly the ones he had from the third game he calls them 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.440
 before I took over 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.950
 under the slogan that we steal two percent enemy transporter prototypes 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.790
 and for him to come at all miserable someone 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.080
 Explosive charge at the gate and clears but quickly from the enemy bunker 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.400
 or shot away 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.770
 Percent of these bunkers serve as soloist Born points for opponents as 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.910
 Mauch powerful fire power too, that's why I'm trying here now 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.219
 on the other one 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.359
 Percent off the enemy bunkers before we move on 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.439
 I'm here now group leader other that's why I can also order 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 Give orders because now my guys are sitting on this point 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.440
 and try to request a cluster bomb around this point 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.489
 turn off the problem is but you can see which one on the right 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.489
 the air defense from the opponent is not switched off yet 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.149
 and he shoots and started bomb just from the sky 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.549
 and nothing happens 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.989
 ung 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.520
 Barbara only five programs will be around an hour 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.599
 Highlights are still unclear 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.599
 wonderfully unfortunately 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:56.579
 so here for the premier class 256 players now here in the 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.089
 final phase 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.509
 Percent of this match by 8 points strike 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.589
 ours clearly that all the same a bit more cars they already have 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 really really busy 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.799
 So who is on mass battles 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.340
 and percent on ego-shooter anyway necessarily go to the net 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.469
 yes, I think it's really good 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.400
 that must be different that there is no question Bayern has nevertheless
