00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
I disconnected it from here and I ran a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.389 
I disconnected it from here and I ran a
wire<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.410> connected<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
wire and I connected it into the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.709 
wire and I connected it into the
receiver<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> always<00:00:51.420> know<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
receiver because you always know that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.180 
receiver because you always know that
the<00:00:51.960> BGC<00:00:52.500> puts<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.430> 5<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.820> 6<00:00:54.059> volts<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> that's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the BGC puts out 5 to 6 volts so that's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.209 
the BGC puts out 5 to 6 volts so that's
what<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> did<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> fan<00:00:58.500> connected

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
what I did so I have the fan connected

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
what I did so I have the fan connected
to<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.879> receiver<00:01:00.809> here<00:01:01.340> which<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.489> had<00:01:02.699> begged

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to my receiver here which I had begged

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.890 
to my receiver here which I had begged
up<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.939> it's<00:01:05.939> snow<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.630> sides

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
