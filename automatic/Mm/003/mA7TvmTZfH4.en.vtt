00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 

okay<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.450> let's<00:00:39.720> start<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.380> setup

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
okay so let's start with your setup

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.370 
okay so let's start with your setup
location<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> low<00:00:42.690> post<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.200> should

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
location for the low post you should

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.640 
location for the low post you should
always<00:00:43.650> locate<00:00:44.190> yourself<00:00:44.370> above<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> block

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
always locate yourself above the block

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.410 
always locate yourself above the block
this<00:00:46.650> will<00:00:46.860> give<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.130> the<00:00:47.280> room<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.700> need<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
this will give you the room you need to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.210 
this will give you the room you need to
be<00:00:48.570> able<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.930> take<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.290> ball<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.740> baseline

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
be able to take the ball to the baseline

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.570 
be able to take the ball to the baseline
side<00:00:50.810> any<00:00:51.810> lower<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.950> shut<00:00:53.190> off<00:00:53.220> that

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
side any lower and you shut off that

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.250 
side any lower and you shut off that
option<00:00:54.000> because<00:00:54.360> you'd<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.840> behind<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
option because you'd be behind the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.880 
option because you'd be behind the
backboard

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
backboard

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.400 
backboard
so<00:00:56.400> a<00:00:56.430> good<00:00:56.730> rule<00:00:56.790> is<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.300> aim<00:00:57.630> for<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.140> spot

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so a good rule is to aim for the spot

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.150 
so a good rule is to aim for the spot
between<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> block<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.970> first<00:01:00.600> peg<00:01:01.160> for

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
between the block and the first peg for

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.400 
between the block and the first peg for
your<00:01:02.280> positioning<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> start<00:01:04.199> with

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
your positioning you want to start with

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.640 
your positioning you want to start with
a<00:01:04.440> stable<00:01:04.949> stance<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:06.000> wide<00:01:06.240> base<00:01:06.650> keep

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
a stable stance and a wide base keep

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
a stable stance and a wide base keep
your<00:01:07.830> butt<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.180> back<00:01:09.390> straight

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
your butt down and your back straight

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.710 
your butt down and your back straight
and<00:01:09.990> your<00:01:10.080> arms<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.400> extended<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.450> those

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and your arms up and extended get those

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.590 
and your arms up and extended get those
hands<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> passer<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.759> you

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.690 

typically<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.650> defender<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.220> going<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.460> play

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
typically the defender is going to play

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.090 
typically the defender is going to play
you<00:01:22.760> in<00:01:23.120> one<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.510> three<00:01:23.690> ways<00:01:23.920> they'll<00:01:24.920> either

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
you in one of three ways they'll either

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.210 
you in one of three ways they'll either
play<00:01:25.430> behind<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:26.320> play<00:01:27.320> on<00:01:27.530> your<00:01:27.680> high<00:01:27.890> side

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
play behind you play on your high side

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.060 
play behind you play on your high side
or<00:01:28.490> they<00:01:28.910> will<00:01:29.090> front<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.540> will<00:01:30.470> go<00:01:30.620> in-depth

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
or they will front you will go in-depth

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.160 
or they will front you will go in-depth
into<00:01:31.280> each<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.790> these<00:01:31.940> and<00:01:32.270> later<00:01:32.450> videos<00:01:32.900> but

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
into each of these and later videos but

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.560 
into each of these and later videos but
be<00:01:33.650> aware<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:34.280> where<00:01:34.520> they<00:01:34.700> play<00:01:35.000> will

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
be aware that where they play will

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.700 
be aware that where they play will
dictate<00:01:36.020> what<00:01:36.530> move<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:37.190> use

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.850 

so<00:01:44.400> now<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> past<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.390> coming<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:46.050> you'll

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so now the past is coming to you you'll

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.650 
so now the past is coming to you you'll
need<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.430> simple<00:01:47.940> step<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.300> most

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
need to do a simple step that most

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.230 
need to do a simple step that most
people<00:01:49.110> neglect<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> use<00:01:49.980> it's<00:01:50.640> called<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
people neglect to use it's called a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.540 
people neglect to use it's called a
release<00:01:51.570> step<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.830> get<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.160> moving

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
release step and it will get you moving

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.300 
release step and it will get you moving
toward<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> past<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:55.200> create<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> bit<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
toward the past and also create a bit of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.780 
toward the past and also create a bit of
separation<00:01:56.660> from<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.780> defender<00:01:58.580> all<00:01:59.580> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
separation from the defender all you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
separation from the defender all you
have<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.540> take<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> short<00:02:01.229> jump<00:02:01.590> stop

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
have to do is take a short jump stop

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.190 
have to do is take a short jump stop
toward<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> pass<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.420> coming<00:02:03.810> into<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
toward the pass as this coming into the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.380 
toward the pass as this coming into the
post<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.550> allow<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:06.119> establish

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
post this will allow you to establish

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.590 
post this will allow you to establish
either<00:02:07.020> foot<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> pivot<00:02:08.250> foot<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> can

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
either foot as a pivot foot so you can

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.690 
either foot as a pivot foot so you can
go<00:02:09.720> either<00:02:09.959> way<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.770> basket

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.699 

on<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.450> catch<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.080> should<00:02:18.470> immediately

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
on the catch you should immediately

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.130 
on the catch you should immediately
gather<00:02:19.250> up<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.640> ball<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.030> chin<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.480> keep
