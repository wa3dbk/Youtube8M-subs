game basically if you don't know what it
is<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> procedurally<00:01:06.360> generated

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
is it's a procedurally generated

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.429 
is it's a procedurally generated
universe<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.010> random<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.900> creators

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
universe that is random so the creators

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
universe that is random so the creators
are<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> create<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> universe<00:01:11.869> which

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
are going to create the universe which

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.590 
are going to create the universe which
hasn't<00:01:13.290> been<00:01:13.439> explored<00:01:14.060> hasn't<00:01:15.060> been<00:01:15.210> like

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
hasn't been explored hasn't been like

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840 
hasn't been explored hasn't been like
planets<00:01:16.080> haven't<00:01:16.409> been<00:01:16.500> found<00:01:16.850> animals

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
planets haven't been found animals

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.450 
planets haven't been found animals
haven't<00:01:18.030> been<00:01:18.180> detected<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.250> everything<00:01:20.250> in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
haven't been detected and everything in

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.600 
haven't been detected and everything in
that<00:01:20.580> universe<00:01:20.939> comes<00:01:21.869> from<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> random<00:01:22.799> sort

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that universe comes from a random sort

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.440 
that universe comes from a random sort
of<00:01:23.759> generator<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> cool<00:01:25.470> thing<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
of generator and the cool thing is is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.160 
of generator and the cool thing is is
everyone's<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> same

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
everyone's going to be in the same

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
everyone's going to be in the same
universe<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.700> social

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
universe so it's kind of a social

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
universe so it's kind of a social
experiment<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> sense<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:32.159> are

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
experiment in the sense that what are

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.350 
experiment in the sense that what are
people<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
people going to do are they going to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
people going to do are they going to
concrete<00:01:33.840> towards<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.500> section<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
concrete towards one section of the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.649 
concrete towards one section of the
universe<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> try<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.329> avoid

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
universe are they going to try and avoid

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
universe are they going to try and avoid
each<00:01:36.869> other<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.500> they're<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.369> know

each other and they're going to you know

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
each other and they're going to you know

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
try and kill each other are they going

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
try and kill each other are they going
to<00:01:40.229> try<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.770> find<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.189> many<00:01:41.340> planets<00:01:41.790> as

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to try and find as many planets as

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.789 
to try and find as many planets as
possible<00:01:42.360> no<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.350> knows<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.770> this

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
possible no one really knows at this

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.289 
possible no one really knows at this
stage<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> really

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
stage and I think it will be a really

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330 
stage and I think it will be a really
exciting<00:01:45.750> experience<00:01:46.259> when<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.649> finally<00:01:47.009> get

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
and have host lobbies and online lobbies

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.670 
and have host lobbies and online lobbies
and<00:05:07.040> things<00:05:07.340> of<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.520> nature<00:05:07.960> but<00:05:08.960> I<00:05:09.440> don't

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
and things of that nature but I don't

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.230 
and things of that nature but I don't

up<00:05:21.740> is<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.100> game<00:05:22.640> i'm<00:05:22.970> really<00:05:23.300> looking

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
up is the game i'm really looking

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.390 
up is the game i'm really looking
forward<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.200> it<00:05:24.410> does<00:05:24.620> border<00:05:25.220> on<00:05:25.370> the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
forward to and it does border on the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.910 
forward to and it does border on the
side<00:05:25.790> by<00:05:26.060> side<00:05:26.390> of<00:05:26.570> things<00:05:26.720> again<00:05:27.140> which<00:05:27.740> is<00:05:27.890> a

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
side by side of things again which is a

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.810 
side by side of things again which is a
little<00:05:28.160> bit<00:05:28.250> weird<00:05:28.460> because<00:05:28.550> I'm<00:05:28.790> not

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
little bit weird because I'm not

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.420 
little bit weird because I'm not
typically<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.480> huge<00:05:29.780> sci-fi<00:05:30.050> fan<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.770> think<00:05:31.310> it's

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
typically a huge sci-fi fan I think it's

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.130 
typically a huge sci-fi fan I think it's
just<00:05:31.460> coincidence<00:05:31.730> but<00:05:32.210> one<00:05:32.480> game<00:05:32.690> I'm<00:05:32.900> really

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
just coincidence but one game I'm really

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.630 
just coincidence but one game I'm really
looking<00:05:33.410> forward<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.740> that<00:05:33.830> is<00:05:34.160> coming<00:05:34.520> out

me I'm just Star Wars fan I enjoy the
series<00:05:48.260> I<00:05:48.560> think<00:05:48.800> it's<00:05:48.890> going<00:05:48.980> to<00:05:49.070> be<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.220> really

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
series I think it's going to be a really

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.760 
series I think it's going to be a really
cool<00:05:49.850> game<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.270> I'm<00:05:50.990> definitely<00:05:51.320> looking

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
cool game and I'm definitely looking

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.290 
cool game and I'm definitely looking
forward<00:05:52.070> to<00:05:52.220> seeing<00:05:52.460> how<00:05:52.610> the<00:05:52.670> game<00:05:52.850> turns<00:05:53.090> out

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
forward to seeing how the game turns out

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.510 
forward to seeing how the game turns out
if<00:05:53.480> it's<00:05:53.630> good<00:05:53.990> it's<00:05:54.770> going<00:05:54.980> to<00:05:55.070> be<00:05:55.160> really

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
if it's good it's going to be really

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.400 
if it's good it's going to be really
good<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:55.880> I<00:05:55.940> think<00:05:55.970> you'll<00:05:56.300> just<00:05:56.720> do<00:05:56.960> really

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
good and I think you'll just do really

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.310 
good and I think you'll just do really
well<00:05:57.590> in<00:05:57.830> terms<00:05:58.160> of<00:05:58.430> just<00:05:58.670> the<00:05:58.790> playerbase<00:05:59.320> but

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
well in terms of just the playerbase but

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.260 
well in terms of just the playerbase but
if<00:06:00.410> it's<00:06:00.560> bad<00:06:00.740> I<00:06:00.770> think<00:06:00.980> it<00:06:01.370> will<00:06:01.460> flop<00:06:01.790> very

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
if it's bad I think it will flop very

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.420 
if it's bad I think it will flop very
very<00:06:02.540> quickly<00:06:02.840> it<00:06:03.080> will<00:06:03.140> just<00:06:03.530> completely<00:06:03.710> go

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
very quickly it will just completely go

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.460 
very quickly it will just completely go
of<00:06:04.550> everyone's<00:06:04.940> radar<00:06:05.150> within<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.080> week<00:06:06.110> I

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
of everyone's radar within a week I

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.070 
of everyone's radar within a week I
don't<00:06:07.190> think<00:06:07.250> people<00:06:07.490> will<00:06:07.670> touch<00:06:07.820> it<00:06:07.900> but<00:06:08.900> if

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
don't think people will touch it but if

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.200 
don't think people will touch it but if
it's<00:06:09.230> good<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.710> think<00:06:10.100> it<00:06:10.220> will<00:06:10.310> be<00:06:10.490> one<00:06:11.000> of<00:06:11.150> the

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
it's good I think it will be one of the

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.370 
it's good I think it will be one of the
games<00:06:11.420> that<00:06:11.510> will<00:06:11.660> stand<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:11.960> test<00:06:12.050> of<00:06:12.320> time

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
games that will stand the test of time

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.470 
games that will stand the test of time
one<00:06:13.040> hundred<00:06:13.340> percent<00:06:13.480> definitely

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
one hundred percent definitely

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.320 
one hundred percent definitely
so<00:06:16.320> another<00:06:16.530> game<00:06:16.860> I'm<00:06:17.130> looking<00:06:17.610> for<00:06:17.850> Taylor

so many this top five is going to be an
absolute<00:06:20.790> nightmare<00:06:20.970> to<00:06:21.390> do<00:06:21.540> but<00:06:22.050> another

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
absolute nightmare to do but another

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
Rainbow six siege it's a Tom Clancy game

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.680 
Rainbow six siege it's a Tom Clancy game
they<00:06:28.080> debut<00:06:28.500> there<00:06:28.680> at<00:06:28.860> e3<00:06:29.190> and<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:30.060> game<00:06:30.330> as<00:06:30.630> a

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
they debut there at e3 and the game as a

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.260 
they debut there at e3 and the game as a
concept<00:06:31.290> is<00:06:32.040> really<00:06:32.460> really<00:06:32.610> simple<00:06:32.910> and<00:06:33.210> the

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
concept is really really simple and the

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.910 
concept is really really simple and the
gameplay<00:06:33.900> is<00:06:34.050> fairly<00:06:34.230> simple<00:06:34.470> as<00:06:34.710> well<00:06:34.890> I

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
gameplay is fairly simple as well I

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.550 
gameplay is fairly simple as well I
imagine<00:06:35.100> but<00:06:35.940> for<00:06:36.180> me<00:06:36.330> I<00:06:36.570> think<00:06:36.870> this<00:06:36.990> game<00:06:37.260> has

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
imagine but for me I think this game has

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.850 
imagine but for me I think this game has
huge<00:06:38.100> huge<00:06:38.940> potential<00:06:39.540> in<00:06:39.660> the<00:06:40.110> eSports

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
huge huge potential in the eSports

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.980 
huge huge potential in the eSports
community<00:06:41.580> and<00:06:41.820> also<00:06:42.300> I<00:06:42.480> think<00:06:42.600> it's<00:06:42.840> going<00:06:42.930> to

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
community and also I think it's going to

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.230 
community and also I think it's going to
be<00:06:43.080> a<00:06:43.140> freaking<00:06:43.470> fun<00:06:43.710> game<00:06:43.980> it's<00:06:44.940> really

be a freaking fun game it's really

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.600 
be a freaking fun game it's really
really<00:06:45.510> basics<00:06:45.900> like<00:06:46.170> idea<00:06:46.740> which<00:06:47.100> a<00:06:47.340> lot<00:06:47.580> of

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
really basics like idea which a lot of

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.720 
really basics like idea which a lot of
good<00:06:47.730> games<00:06:48.090> are<00:06:48.480> there<00:06:48.870> like<00:06:49.050> basic<00:06:49.710> idea<00:06:50.130> so
