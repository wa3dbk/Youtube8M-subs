 what they have I was not me not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 computer will not support me all 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 those ways but just in case in the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 description of the video I will be leaving you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.559
 season so when we enter the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.590
 home you'll show a little not 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.390
 there are going to be many decorative objects 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.399
 that he used since that is a mold 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.379
 biblio kraft but good you when 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.719
 the modes are installed download it in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.600
 all that will be able to have everything the same 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.149
 that the vegetable house is like that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.590
 the vegetable house is the original very 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.230
 measured a little bit the a that is where 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.300
 supposedly put the wine I'm not going to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 teach the whole house because that then what 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.589
 I'll do in another video 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.010
 but as you can see here is all 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.979
 the house that up green objects all 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.350
 is the house is without any problem 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.180
 so well let's teach other 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.450
 things here where sow already by her 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.160
 had his ship this is the church the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.350
 I'm teaching you to know that everything 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.840
 the village that was 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.000
 caring and that I wanted to repopulate here should 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.390
 be the portals but as I do not have 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.850
 the only mods are the hell 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 now over there we have the pyramids and 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.899
 all over the world they will be able to find 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.820
 what he found if you have the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.140
 coordinates so perfect you can 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.300
 go here are the pyramids and all that 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.840
 but well now I'm going to teach how 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.880
 install this this map for minecraft 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 just in case it only serves for the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.679
 version 1.6 point 4 forwards well 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.720
 that we're good we're not going to go through the 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.399
 installation of the vegetable planet map 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.050
 fourth season the first thing we should 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.229
 to do is to click on this box that 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.090
 it says download download we're going to close 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.800
 this window that is going to open for us what 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.160
 it came up on mediafire e so there it is 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.470
 we hope they are downloaded that weighs 193 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 megas but I'm going to give cancel 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.150
 because I already have it so good 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.660
 Once downloaded it will appear 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.410
 this fact winrar this of the books in 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.750
 where is the map of the plant planet 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.580
 here is this plant planet is with 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.810
 the mods but already the explained that yes 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.190
 you have the world are going to have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.770
 no problem now what 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.180
 we do let's start this windows 8 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.390
 so I have to go to the side 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.390
 but you put start percent app 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.670
 top and we give him enter now he's going 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.660
 open in the roaming folder we give to 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.450
 point minecraft and here you know we are going to 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.580
 eliminate this so that to teach them and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.180
 Now what we are going to do is pull this 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.480
 folder just 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.409
 your birds to your folder you know what is 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.560
 where they have saved games 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.579
 We wait for this folder to be passed to us 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.349
 of plant planet and we will be able to have 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.129
 your maps without any problem 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.560
 there it is already we have it eye is copied this 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.200
 folder here can not copy this 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.659
 winrar file because if they do not go away 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.000
 to achieve but it's not going to give you that 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.280
 well let's close this and let's go 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.069
 now to minecraft to see that no 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.049
 There are no problems, I have it 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.269
 same and cross because I have several 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.650
 but you must have it in the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.989
 normal desktop let's start it eye 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.540
 which is for version 1.6 point 4 for 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.579
 forward because the for 1.5 point 2 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.010
 back there are no horse armors 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.889
 and all that, so that's not going to be able 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.139
 appear and possibly possibly them 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:53.409
