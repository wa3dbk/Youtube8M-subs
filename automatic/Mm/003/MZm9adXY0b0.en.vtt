going to be played around the world and
there<00:02:49.140> was<00:02:49.230> speculation<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.830> rovenia<00:02:50.190> was

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
there was speculation that rovenia was

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
not going to show up at all at this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.290 
not going to show up at all at this
stadium<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.650> guess<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> good

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
stadium but I guess this is a good

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.030 
stadium but I guess this is a good
strategy<00:02:54.630> from<00:02:54.990> Bernd<00:02:55.260> Schuster<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.680> call<00:02:55.860> him

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
strategy from Bernd Schuster to call him

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160 
strategy from Bernd Schuster to call him
up<00:02:56.130> anyway<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.820> see<00:02:57.330> how<00:02:57.420> robinia<00:02:57.810> was<00:02:57.960> going

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
up anyway and see how robinia was going

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.070 
up anyway and see how robinia was going
to<00:02:58.320> respond<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:59.480> think<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.570> also<00:03:00.720> shows<00:03:01.050> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
to respond I think it also shows the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.510 
to respond I think it also shows the
fact<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.500> he<00:03:01.680> wasn't<00:03:01.920> called<00:03:02.250> into<00:03:02.460> a

fact that he wasn't called into a
substitute<00:03:03.090> role<00:03:03.360> says<00:03:04.110> plenty<00:03:04.500> about<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
substitute role says plenty about the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.750 
substitute role says plenty about the
