what you're doing and going to work on
the<00:00:49.379> eyes<00:00:50.180> choose<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.390> eyes<00:00:51.659> enlarge<00:00:52.619> and

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
the eyes choose these eyes enlarge and

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.469 
the eyes choose these eyes enlarge and
twice<00:00:52.979> and<00:00:53.309> rotate<00:00:53.699> them<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.150> that<00:00:54.330> the

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
twice and rotate them so that the

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.299 
twice and rotate them so that the
eyelashes<00:00:55.019> are<00:00:55.170> pointing<00:00:55.500> downwards<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.129> far

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
eyelashes are pointing downwards as far

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.869 
eyelashes are pointing downwards as far
as<00:00:56.400> they<00:00:56.549> can<00:00:56.640> go

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
as they can go

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.479 
as they can go
and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.989> position<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.650> on<00:00:58.799> the<00:00:59.070> face<00:00:59.250> like

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and then position them on the face like

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
and then position them on the face like
so<00:01:00.229> next<00:01:01.229> we're<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.650> move<00:01:01.860> on<00:01:01.979> to<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so next we're going to move on to the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
so next we're going to move on to the
eyebrows<00:01:02.549> and<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.360> sure<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> choose<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
eyebrows and make sure you choose this

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.899 
eyebrows and make sure you choose this
pair<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> eyebrows<00:01:04.799> particularly<00:01:05.489> important

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
pair of eyebrows particularly important

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.929 
pair of eyebrows particularly important
and<00:01:06.229> position<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.860> face<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.430> being

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and position them on the face like being

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.570 
and position them on the face like being
shown<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> screen<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.860> makes<00:01:11.190> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
shown on the screen now this makes the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.040 
shown on the screen now this makes the
dripping<00:01:11.910> from<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> eye<00:01:12.180> sockets<00:01:12.660> of<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
dripping from the eye sockets of this

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.140 
dripping from the eye sockets of this
eyelet<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> character<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.940> is<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
eyelet to a character and this is the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
eyelet to a character and this is the
best<00:01:15.300> way<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.480> do<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.870> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.070> somebody

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
best way to do it if you are somebody

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880 
best way to do it if you are somebody
who<00:01:17.970> believed<00:01:18.390> there's<00:01:18.810> no<00:01:19.020> dent<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> mask

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.160 
who believed there's no dent in the mask
for<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> nose<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.880> by<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.480> means<00:01:21.630> leave<00:01:22.140> the
