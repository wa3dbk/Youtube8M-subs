00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 no no 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.840
 hello kids and mister gameplay os 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.120
 I bring a video that many people like me 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.470
 has asked and well as you have seen in 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.869
 the title how to level up and lower 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.180
 prestige in zombies and good as 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.180
 you know is a subject that has given a lot of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.010
 what to talk then during all the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
 call of duty black ops' season top 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.340
 peace and good as you know is something 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.920
 important how good each one 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.140
 we have our agility tell you that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.170
 it is not totally defined how to climb 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.090
 and it gets out of prestige there are still people 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.910
 that more or less yes you already know 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.010
 I say if you do not know how much not 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.460
 is 100% insured but good 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.739
 each person depends on how the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.010
 times that everything else has been killed 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.350
 account and important space is worth because 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.750
 the top prestige and you live in your 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.150
 skill as a zombie player 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.470
 not all the casualties you can get 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.090
 a broken party sent a vote and die 20 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.730
 times you will not go up in life 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.600
 because because the other three killed 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:32.560
 is totally all we have of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.830
 zombies to climb prestige climbs 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.140
 of prestige when we have a reason 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.960
 balanced our markers 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.470
 good balance let's move on to see 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.000
 how the principles are placed that all 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.430
 we know first of all we have the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.510
 bone that good is a required radius to 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.810
 from 20 with everything 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.000
 we all start from a again the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.670
 challenge and good is not much to talk about 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.390
 and you all know the prestige insurance 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.080
 is two crossed bones and good is a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.840
 Required ratio from 20 to 40 more 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.530
 or less is worth the third prestige is a 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.140
 caravel with a shield of fruits 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.900
 is this prestige is the one that pretty much 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.730
 many people are many people 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 remained stuck in the prestige of the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.920
 of the caravel with the blue eyes a 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.050
 lots of people and good and this is the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.930
 intermediate vale is the means that exists 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.069
 is when a person is normal and very 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.840
 bad very good and we can say good here 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.420
 it changes things and then it gets you 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.730
 the blue eyes when you wear the fifth 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.230
 day playing eye this does not mean that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.450
 you are going to rise in prestige this 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.220
 it means that you have been playing for five days 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.820
 both in this and in the knife 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.950
 like in the one with the good shotguns we're going 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.590
 to move to the next number four 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:01.030
 which is a knife with a caravel and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:06.890
 requires a radius of one hundred 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.870
 140 to 160 its price that good there's no 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.880
 many people who have this retirement but 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.280
 it is little complicated to get it and the 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.470
 last prestige is the prestige of the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.930
 shotguns that good is the one that all the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.580
 world wants to have is a price more or 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.880
 less from 190 to 200 and well there 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.310
