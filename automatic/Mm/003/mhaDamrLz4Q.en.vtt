00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.200
 a challenge gamers of sonic the hedgehog for 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.960
 sega megadrive 16 bits magic began 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.960
 to come to the brothers' house with 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.119
 suns although it is not born of the cable 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.609
 that will check the date on ladies and 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.640
 Gentlemen do not miss this video with 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.830
 all the love that they are 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.960
 good people well here we are in another 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 retro gamers let's remember this 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 wonder of videogames for sega 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.860
 megadrive master exist I met him in 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.390
 principle for master there are two was the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.540
 original sony 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.879
 sonic the hedgehog for the sonic friends 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.239
 well yes I perfectly remember that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.550
 I was in 1991 and I was 11 years old and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.909
 my parents gave me for me will be 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.400
 master system of this great game that supposed 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.949
 for sega in addition to what nobody else 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.219
 I thought because its direct competition 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.199
 Nintendo as he had a character 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.990
 emblem as a mario as a mascot between 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.960
 quotes from your console but sonic between 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.300
 attempts several failed attempts as 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 Alex Alex Kidd himself was going to 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.950
 be the sega mascot did not come forward 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.130
 and it was not until the appearance of the famous 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.850
 blue sonic hedgehog when finally sega gave 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.280
 with the nail hit the nail and this 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.070
 game sold a lot competition 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 direct from mario although we already know that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.950
 today in this present have 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.040
 shared several games these two 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 flagships 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.800
 in the year 91 and imagined life and we're going 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.600
 to imagine that sonic and mario would share 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.150
 in a video game I already think there are two or 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.400
 three is from the olympic games the one from 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.410
 the winter Olympics or a 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.720
 pretty funny game yes a wink 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.540
 for the fans as I said before 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.060
 Well, we said that the year was running 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.790
 1991 and we still discovered a hedgehog 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.650
 more friendly with super levels 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.740
 bright colors we were happy 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.930
 very much the view a soundtrack 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.369
 amazing recently we were lucky to 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.950
 enjoy the sonic the 20th anniversary of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.540
 sonic or with the collector's edition already 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.790
 all views of seen the video that 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.280
 we have a box and an edition that 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.560
 represented the most emblematic phases 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.170
 of that game updated to times 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.230
 modern and a good wonder 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.170
 we know that this platform was based on 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.420
 pass the scenarios in 2d in that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.920
 epoch the three dimensions I do not know the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 young people would come who are watching 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.560
 this video I do not know if you can reach or 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.790
 to imagine the success that game had 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.010
 in two dimensions and goodbye 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.409
 colorful super entertaining and for 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.170
 course the terminal speed of sony 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.390
 we are not used to seeing a 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.060
 character run so much you know how it goes 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.930
 mario was not a match for the front 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.689
 backwards 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.599
 they are and gave adrenaline that spark that 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.849
 everyone was looking in the 90s chute 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.310
 of speed and here at last what 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.700
 we find clear fighting against 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.129
 always the nice doctor robotnik 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.030
 also the weakest quintÃ¡s 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.549
 you will remember the cartoon series 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.109
 of the sony that was issued is going away 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.329
 I remember in telecinco the ends of 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.010
 week in the morning to finish 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.530
 see the series and turn on our mega 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.020
 drive our mestre system and play 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.360
 this awesome game 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.970
 and then we already know the continuations of 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.280
 shanik in which I hope to be able to bring them to 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.060
 some entity retro gamers like sounds 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.920
 sonic knuckles are and that has led a 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.670
 heap of super video games of the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.560
 sega hand a pity to be finished 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.880
 how it ended but good are and still 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.580
 giving today a lot of war 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.580
 well what else can we say about this 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.950
 title has been super valued have 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.080
 spent the years that have passed 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.420
 all over the world the most magazines 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.950
 specialized there are very few games of 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.410
 sonic that can receive a critical 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.420
 exaggerated there will be better games 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.280
 worse games but of course always 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.740
 that a game has been treated with affection 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.020
 by the developers the game of 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.690
 sonic that has maintained its essence 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.570
 It has always been very good with very good 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.820
 scoring and specialized journals 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.780
 they have always had a deal more than 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.210
 positive towards this blue hedgehog of that from 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.710
 sega sonic not know how many times he would 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.680
 said they are already and that in the video but it is 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.330
 that could throw me to hours and hours 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.770
 Well, I also do not want to 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.460
 tell you that the game was based not on 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.740
 typical 2d platforms we advance 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.590
 we collected 100 rings rings us 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.900
 they gave a life authentic phases 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.169
 vertigo of speed with the famous 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.060
 the famous trunks that had with game 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:59.910
 right now not fallen I do not fall name 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.650
 also to tell you about the emblematic 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.229
 evil characters that there was out there 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.139
 Like some beetles, the buzzing wasps 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.570
 these the piranhas the crabs was 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.979
 incredible and then always at the end of 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.380
 each screen we fought against 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.030
 robotnik doctor mounted the bastard in his 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.360
 ship that made life impossible 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.340
 and then also this 16 bit version 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.050
 it was totally different from the 8-bit ones 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.720
 of master exist although the game is 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.210
 called sonic sonic hedgehog equal 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.880
 fact they were two versions totally 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.820
 different you could feel a lot of jumping 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.830
 from 8 to 16 bits and I first 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.960
 provide 8 bits and when to provide 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.720
 megadrive was amazing today 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.940
 thank you and thank God I have in my 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.760
 original sonic with its mediatrade box 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.530
 in perfect condition 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.470
 Well, I hope you know how to value 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.680
 you are like memories that I am doing 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.220
 when he recapped a video game that has 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.110
 marked a marked my childhood has 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.300
 a special flavor every time I talk about 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.370
 I get in front of the computer to see 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.160
 images and directly I start talking 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.380
 talk and talk and I wanted to record it for 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.090
 that you will waste your account of 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.820
 video games what can mark a 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.680
 person not always positively and 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.780
 I hope you take it as such that 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.250
 listen to these little stories that 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.840

 it came out very cool 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.410
 so I hope you like it and we
