animation<00:00:20.580> tutorials<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.869> covers<00:00:22.199> things

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
animation tutorials it covers things

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.400 
animation tutorials it covers things
like<00:00:22.529> weight<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.279> timing<00:00:24.029> spacing<00:00:24.810> stretch

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
like weight and timing spacing stretch

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.830 
like weight and timing spacing stretch
and<00:00:25.710> pull<00:00:26.070> anticipation<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.330> many<00:00:27.510> things

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and pull anticipation so many things

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.650 
and pull anticipation so many things
that<00:00:28.140> will<00:00:28.320> bring<00:00:28.439> an<00:00:28.740> animation<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.670> life<00:00:29.880> now

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that will bring an animation to life now

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.479 
that will bring an animation to life now
we<00:00:30.720> can't<00:00:30.960> cover<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.859> any<00:00:32.279> one

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
we can't cover them all in any one

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.160 
we can't cover them all in any one
tutorial<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.210> barely<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.540> able<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> focus<00:00:33.960> on

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
tutorial will barely be able to focus on

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.100 
tutorial will barely be able to focus on
one<00:00:34.410> sometimes<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:36.480> important<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
one sometimes but it's very important to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.750 
one sometimes but it's very important to
at<00:00:37.200> least<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:37.590> kind<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.370> background

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
at least have some kind of a background

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
at least have some kind of a background
knowledge<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:40.050> these

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
knowledge into what it is what these

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.110 
knowledge into what it is what these
things<00:00:40.500> are<00:00:40.770> referencing<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.610> how<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.850> can

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
things are referencing and how we can

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.750 
things are referencing and how we can
use<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.540> how<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.260> are<00:00:43.469> useful<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.100> want<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
use them how they are useful I want to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
use them how they are useful I want to
cover<00:00:44.910> essentially<00:00:45.570> three<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.200> things

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
cover essentially three of these things

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.229 
cover essentially three of these things
in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> next<00:00:46.890> few<00:00:47.460> tutorials

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
in the next few tutorials

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.200 
in the next few tutorials
the<00:00:48.809> first<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.260> key<00:00:49.530> frames<00:00:49.890> key<00:00:50.700> frames<00:00:51.000> in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the first is key frames key frames in

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
the first is key frames key frames in
essence<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> moments<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.500> an<00:00:52.649> animation

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
essence are the moments in an animation

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
essence are the moments in an animation
that<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.090> anchors<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.050> what's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that we use as the anchors for what's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.279 
that we use as the anchors for what's
coming<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.370> between<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.090> key<00:00:57.270> frames<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.899> we

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
coming so between the key frames we we

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.840 
coming so between the key frames we we
get<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> motion<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> movement<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.609> push

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
get the motion and the movement the push

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910 
get the motion and the movement the push
and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> pool's<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> anticipation<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and the pool's the anticipation but the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
and the pool's the anticipation but the
keyframes<00:01:02.520> themselves<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
keyframes themselves are like the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.100 
keyframes themselves are like the
highlights<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.189> peak<00:01:05.430> moments<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
highlights the the peak moments of the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
highlights the the peak moments of the
most<00:01:07.260> intense<00:01:07.770> moments<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> movement<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
most intense moments of movement so that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.280 
most intense moments of movement so that
the<00:01:09.869> rest<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.229> covered<00:01:10.680> within<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:13.020> next

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the rest is covered within that the next

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.480 
the rest is covered within that the next
thing<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> want<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> focus<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
thing that I want to focus on is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
thing that I want to focus on is
physicality<00:01:15.450> these<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> things<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
physicality these are the things that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.499 
physicality these are the things that
will<00:01:16.799> make<00:01:16.830> characters<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
will make characters and and the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.080 
will make characters and and the
environment<00:01:19.049> itself<00:01:19.590> feel<00:01:19.920> real<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.820> whatever

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
environment itself feel real so whatever

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.240 
environment itself feel real so whatever
is<00:01:21.180> happening<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.720> someone<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.890> know<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
is happening if someone you know in a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
is happening if someone you know in a
windstorm<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.970> someone's<00:01:24.330> being<00:01:24.540> rained<00:01:24.810> on

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
windstorm if someone's being rained on

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.320 
windstorm if someone's being rained on
or<00:01:25.080> lifting<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.710> heavy<00:01:25.830> object<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.939> way<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
or lifting a heavy object the way that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
or lifting a heavy object the way that
we<00:01:27.450> animate<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.259> approach<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> drawings<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
we animate and approach the drawings in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.940 
we animate and approach the drawings in
the<00:01:29.579> animation<00:01:29.909> effect<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.049> physicality<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the animation effect that physicality so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
the animation effect that physicality so
we<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:32.820> sure<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.210> cover<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
we want to make sure that we cover that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.410 
we want to make sure that we cover that
as<00:01:33.770> much<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.799> possible<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.210> it'll

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
as much as possible but you know it'll

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
as much as possible but you know it'll
come<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.810> time<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.140> can't<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.619> one

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
come in time we can't do it in one

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
come in time we can't do it in one
animation<00:01:38.189> tutorial<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> next<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:39.780> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
animation tutorial and the next thing is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
animation tutorial and the next thing is
purpose<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.009> essentially<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.579> someone's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
purpose so essentially if someone's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
purpose so essentially if someone's
walking<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.570> need<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.500> walking

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
walking they need to be walking

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280 
walking they need to be walking
somewhere<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> reason<00:01:45.030> even<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.960> as

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
somewhere for a reason even if it's as

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.510 
somewhere for a reason even if it's as
simple<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.799> giving<00:01:47.100> them<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> right

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
simple as giving them the right

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
simple as giving them the right
expression<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.600> sometimes<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.200> could<00:01:49.259> be

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
expression but sometimes they could be

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.780 
expression but sometimes they could be
lifting<00:01:49.829> their<00:01:49.979> arms<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.340> certain<00:01:50.640> way

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
lifting their arms a certain way

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.179 
lifting their arms a certain way
sometimes<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.479> could<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.659> hunched<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
sometimes they could be hunched over you

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.010 
sometimes they could be hunched over you
know<00:01:53.280> give<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.790> giving<00:01:54.060> their<00:01:54.210> walk<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> purpose

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
know give it giving their walk a purpose

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.050 
know give it giving their walk a purpose
it's<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> walk<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:56.460> every<00:01:56.729> walk<00:01:56.909> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's not just a walk not every walk is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.080 
it's not just a walk not every walk is
the<00:01:57.240> same<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.880> animating

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the same so I'm going to be animating

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.870 
the same so I'm going to be animating
using<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> program<00:02:01.049> called<00:02:01.259> Adobe<00:02:01.979> Flash<00:02:02.399> cs3

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
using a program called Adobe Flash cs3

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.819 
using a program called Adobe Flash cs3
there<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.869> different<00:02:04.140> versions<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.560> flash

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
there are different versions of flash

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.440 
there are different versions of flash
all<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.310> them<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:05.549> absolutely<00:02:05.700> fine<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
all of them are absolutely fine to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.210 
all of them are absolutely fine to
animate<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.890> version<00:02:08.009> I'm

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
animate with but that's the version I'm

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.930 
animate with but that's the version I'm
using<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.590> now<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.430> choice<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
using just so I know now the choice is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.050 
using just so I know now the choice is
yours

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
yours

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.780 
yours
take<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.540> red<00:02:13.750> pill<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.319> you'll<00:02:15.280> be<00:02:15.430> learning

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
take the red pill and you'll be learning

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.110 
take the red pill and you'll be learning
frame-by-frame<00:02:16.270> animation<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:18.099> is<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.730> much

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
frame-by-frame animation this is a much

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.140 
frame-by-frame animation this is a much
more<00:02:19.330> grueling<00:02:19.599> process<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.380> rewards<00:02:20.830> are

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
more grueling process the rewards are

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.809 
more grueling process the rewards are
more<00:02:22.150> enjoyable<00:02:22.510> because<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.489> get<00:02:24.670> more

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
more enjoyable because you can get more

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:25.949 
more enjoyable because you can get more
out<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.330> make<00:02:25.660> more<00:02:25.900> a

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
out of it you can make more a

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.330 
out of it you can make more a
frame-by-frame<00:02:26.349> animation

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
frame-by-frame animation

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.100 
frame-by-frame animation
sometimes<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.360> frame-by-frame<00:02:28.720> animation

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
sometimes the frame-by-frame animation

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.839 
sometimes the frame-by-frame animation
can<00:02:29.530> be<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.650> bit<00:02:29.800> choppy<00:02:29.980> especially<00:02:30.640> if<00:02:30.730> you're

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
can be a bit choppy especially if you're

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.000 
can be a bit choppy especially if you're
very<00:02:31.030> new<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.569> so<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.989> won't<00:02:32.260> be<00:02:32.500> perfect<00:02:32.739> at

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
very new to it so it won't be perfect at

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.550 
very new to it so it won't be perfect at
first<00:02:33.300> take<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.450> blue<00:02:34.690> pill<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.260> you'll<00:02:35.470> be

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
first take the blue pill and you'll be

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.410 
first take the blue pill and you'll be
learning<00:02:35.830> tweened<00:02:36.160> animation<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.269> much

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
learning tweened animation this is much

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.809 
learning tweened animation this is much
better<00:02:37.599> for<00:02:37.750> beginners<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.950> very<00:02:39.160> easy<00:02:39.459> to

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
better for beginners it's very easy to

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.630 
better for beginners it's very easy to
cover<00:02:40.239> even<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.050> simple<00:02:41.500> form<00:02:41.769> if<00:02:42.010> you're

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
cover even in a simple form if you're

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400 
cover even in a simple form if you're
just<00:02:42.819> starting<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.599> probably<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.200> best

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
just starting and it's probably the best

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.520 
just starting and it's probably the best
way<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.739> begin<00:02:45.069> learning<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:46.230> tend<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> use<00:02:47.350> a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
way to begin learning I tend to use a

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.890 
way to begin learning I tend to use a
hybrid<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:48.100> both<00:02:48.370> quite<00:02:48.790> often<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.600> kind<00:02:49.810> of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
hybrid of both quite often to kind of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.570 
hybrid of both quite often to kind of
mix<00:02:50.110> twinned<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.650> frame<00:02:50.860> by<00:02:50.980> frame<00:02:51.010> for<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
mix twinned and frame by frame for the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.229 
mix twinned and frame by frame for the
use<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.959> conservation<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.080> time<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:55.120> know

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
use of conservation in time and you know

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.170 
use of conservation in time and you know
also<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.810> add<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.080> stylistic<00:02:56.739> effect<00:02:57.069> but<00:02:58.060> in

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
also to add a stylistic effect but in

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.509 
also to add a stylistic effect but in
essence<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.750> comes<00:02:59.319> down<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.739> who<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.130> are<00:03:00.220> and

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
essence it comes down to who you are and

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.910 
essence it comes down to who you are and
what<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.000> prefer<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:02.049> check<00:03:02.680> out<00:03:02.799> the
