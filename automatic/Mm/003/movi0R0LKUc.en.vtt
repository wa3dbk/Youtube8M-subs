this has a shift kit valve body plate I
can<00:00:59.680> tell<00:00:59.860> because<00:01:00.040> it's<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.580> black<00:01:00.850> metal

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
you can see that in the camera is

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.620 
you can see that in the camera is
actually<00:04:33.100> losing<00:04:33.760> all<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.120> materials

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630
