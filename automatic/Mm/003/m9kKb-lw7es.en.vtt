00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
want this to be at a constant 99.5

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.110 
want this to be at a constant 99.5
degrees<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.860> comes<00:02:35.130> with<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> syllabus<00:02:35.940> that

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

I also made my meat thermometer in there
just<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.380> see<00:02:40.560> if<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.070> accurate<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:44.220> get

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
just to see if it's accurate and I get

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.800 
just to see if it's accurate and I get
these<00:02:44.490> little<00:02:44.730> quail<00:02:44.910> eggs<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.330> then<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.660> can
