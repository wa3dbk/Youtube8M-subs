things<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:09.040> we<00:01:09.130> like<00:01:09.280> about<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.580> obviously

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
things that we like about it obviously

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.280 
things that we like about it obviously
we<00:01:10.060> describe<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:10.570> only<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:11.230> know

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
we describe it it's only you know

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.260 
we describe it it's only you know
basically<00:01:11.920> walk<00:01:12.280> away<00:01:12.610> from<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.910> cruise<00:01:13.090> ship

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
basically walk away from the cruise ship

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.150 
basically walk away from the cruise ship
terminal<00:01:13.510> here<00:01:13.870> so<00:01:14.200> what<00:01:14.770> was<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.010> first

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
terminal here so what was the first

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.660 
terminal here so what was the first
