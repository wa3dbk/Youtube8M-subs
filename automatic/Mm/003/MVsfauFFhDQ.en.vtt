00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.450
Méhari and Adrien is the story of a couple

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.716
who plays together, who has fun, who plays pretend,

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:23.237
who plays very childish games,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
games that are sometimes very silly, often rather crazy, 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.361
and it's difficult to really understand why.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
One can feel that there's something strange, as if they were 
fleeing fom something...

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:35.384
You're right, it sounds like a little bird!

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.881
It is a little bird.

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:39.428
- Are you sure?
- I speak "little-bird".

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:43.013
Our characters are aboard a sidecar

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:50.600
which isn't really a sidecar, it's actually a... bike. And a boat.

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:54.998
Basically, the author, Blutsch, is having fun getting us confused.

00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:59.661
We find the characters on the road and they're 
fleeing from something.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:04.271
A flight from time, a flight from death; 

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:08.394
there is a fear of growing up, of growing old,

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:11.000
and their way of fleeing this is by playing.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.824
They are adults, adults who play like kids.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:18.455
They're going to bury a mosquito,
they're going to mug a surgeon...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
- You think they're coming back?
- I don't know, do I!

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:26.600
- We'd better clear out of here - away from them.

00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:30.200
- Did you see which way they went?
- No.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.821
- So we could end up right behind them.
- True.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.099
Blutsch's writing pertains to the genre of comedy,

00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:42.607
talking lightly and humoristically of grave topics,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.127
topics closely linked to a catastrophe,

00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:49.808
and depending on what play he's writing,

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:53.800
he will tell of a catastrophe that can be on a world-wide scale

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
or a human scale, such as in Méhari and Adrien.

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:03.225
There is, between the characters, within their couple, 
a coming catastrophe.

00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:09.035
- They're coming back!
- Let's not move.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.449
- They're looking for us, what do we do?
- Let's not move!

00:02:13.653 --> 00:02:18.999
It's a sort of crazy universe, really similar to "Monty Python", 
especially in the play "Gzion",

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:25.259
but as the play progresses, the crazy stuff always degenerates

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:30.577
into what I'd call a slow descent into Hell - especially in 
"Méhari and Adrien".

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:34.866
- Do you, Miss, accept to marry?
- Yes, Father, I accept.

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:38.883
- Will you be faithful?
- I will be faithful.

00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.331
- Until death?
-Until death.

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:46.758
"Méhari and Adrien" is presented as a road-play, 
in the same way as a road-movie.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:52.584
The play is built on the same model:
there are travelling scenes and stationary scenes.

00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:58.312
Thus, the play is very cinematically built.

00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:04.900
The play itself is closely related to many things
other than theatre :

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:10.585
there's cinema, comics, cartoons, a lot of music -

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:14.800
the performance is riddled with music
and auditory atmospheres.

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:17.800
- That's all you have to say?
- That's all you have to say?

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.000
- I asked you a question!
- I asked you a question!

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.000
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.800
The text is extremely rich and the play
has a very quick rhythm;

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.391
I believe there are about 20 different scenes
in 50 minutes.

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:38.496
We use the stage to create many different
universes: 

00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:45.200
there is the universe of the road, there's reality,
and then there is fantasy.

00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:50.000
We dream some situations. Sometimes it's
one of their games,

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:55.449
sometimes we're more or less in Méhari's mind.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.934
- Then it's cancer.
- Cancer, doctor?
