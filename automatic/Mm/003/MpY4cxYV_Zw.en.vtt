00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.999
 the rapper 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.459
 the rotterdammers beat the tukkers the layoffs than expected as a citizen 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.539
 the toys two to six players and it combines to become some sort of biggest 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.539
 do not expect too much it is especially nice for the little ones but also if 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.449
 adult you can enjoy your staff 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.619
 look at the frame 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.619
 we get missing 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.120
 8 when getting 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.760
 the game was 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 with the magic castle and the village 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.130
 the rules the german ship has a dutch winner of the teachers 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.550
 stuck 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 a dozen should come because they collide at the bottom 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.000
 six pawns in the six colors, two dice 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.600
 and the tickets must collect animals to win the game 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 to play a game 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.550
 in the game, a symbol on the board is often used after athletes 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.810
 is with a tree 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.310
 there the trees are more the trees are being exchanged 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.840
 and put down blind so that nobody knows 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.150
 which tree which symbol to venture 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.630
 the group bloodbath in the village 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.920
 the beginning 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.190
 the box is marked by too large a cities 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.560
 and then we have here the pile with the command hangover being the top one 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.650
 killed for turned over 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.690
 and that is the object that everyone is visiting in this case 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.410
 the societies of work of difference with you and the victory 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.720
 the way is 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.840
 how many places using 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.470
 2 dice hurt 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 and that is going to move the number about that you have and laundering 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.640
 move separately so you can say I now have a 5 and 4 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.890
 may I say wolf pack 2 3 the four and five goes ahead and another did not find any 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.790
 shrink 3 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.720
 4 the other way 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.110
 that is not all that interesting in this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.920
 but if you know later after the work matches I put is important 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:11.559
 was allowed to drive 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.419
 or come to the barking action alive 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.499
 You can look around the tree exactly on a block 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.549
 and then you get one 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.699
 fool 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.119
 that must remember it is the spin off of 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.289
 The village 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.149
 from playing 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.859
 that is on this band well so you are going to look at all the symbols that are really there 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.049
 no longer goes in search of water the mets continued 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.289
 awake animal found 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:40.059
 then you come here then you try exactly on the key 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.029
 come and you have to 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.669
 exactly then you are not allowed 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.889
 move on end by banging i still have five juices no drinks 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:47.980
 privilege 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.599
 no one come true 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.599
 so there you can't use two dice techniques for that 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:55.379
 you stand there 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.319
 then you say 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.209
 the mezz of 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.519
 the way well that's not true 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.629
 this is castle club 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.849
 then you're off he back to the beginning 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.109
 is it working 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.759
 do you get this card 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:12.759
 and I am turned over the next 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.079
 you come to a box where everything else is 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.499
 then you can do that 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.359
 send agent village back 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.889
 and then there is also a building element gorredijk with the dice 2 the same 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.729
 person is all about 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.259
 then you can 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.569
 you may say i'm going to use it as normal as relocation stops 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.369
 that there is yet to explain it over 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.129
 3 different options on scene 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.289
 the local youth 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.629
 You pick up blue and I immediately look around at the tree of what's here 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.680
 or you move out to horseshoe animal at the castle 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.799
 that occurred more than a third option is you grab the piles with the remaining 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.489
 cards the angry one turned straight 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.489
 4 referee Peter Vos Thursday 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.149
 because the street 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:05.329
 and turns 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.369
 the euro poster 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.989
 the big bad wolf from Little Red Riding Hood is now there 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.749
 the one being sought 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.509
 and so you continue to play one 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.509
 3 hangover assignment 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.860
 salland like me in the beginning the first one would be a combination between one 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.159
 some geese and some after 3 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.379
 you should not expect too much but it is just a little game 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.520
 the fairytale theater 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.270
 especially popular with more youngsters and 6 the boss players 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.370
 there is also a game 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.439
 I'm not going to waste too many words 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.169
 it's just that they put it together that already has different elements 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.539
 sometimes combined with the other side of the game 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.270
 which takes longer than you would like 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.650
 but that would appear from a corner 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.280
 I get 6 right away
