00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.260
 Valencia has many things to see 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.640
 so I got up early to make the most of my last day 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.319
 and I do not want to leave without making a small visit to the inseparable companion of this 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.319
 capital 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.179
 The turia waters as they passed through the city caused more than one 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.920
 flood 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.900
 thus the Valencians opted for a radical idea to divert the course of the river 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 iker and the largest lung of Valencia 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.780
 it is a garden more than 10 kilometers long 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.010
 hence, many Valencians practice sports every morning 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
 It's worth it to walk around its fountains there 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.300
 like this from the sea 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.260
 by recent ones like the one of santiago calatrava, if you know he has given away 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.760
 and to your city 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 so they can then say if one is not a prophet in their land 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.430
 and from the center to the center 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 to discover another of the jewels of modernism valencia 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.830
 one of the most beloved spaces for Valencian is this the market of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.350
 colon that has also recently been rehabilitated 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.890
 with this work goes back to the rich first row become a place to 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.650
 the leisure 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.790
 the stores and the enjoyment 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.790
 I'm going to stay for breakfast around here 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.270
 traditional flower and food stands now coexist with the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
 splendid terraces of bars and restaurants 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.370
 bricks ceramics and wood 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.770
 have undergone specific treatments 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.750
 the most recovered item 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.570
 s &amp; p in cÃ¡diz 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.120
 original sword 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.170
 the result is the opening of a new urban space with a colorful facade and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 very Valencian 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.330
 and in my eagerness to discover the most cultural side of Valencia 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.450
 I have wanted to visit one of the many museums that it offers 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.530
 this time I choose helmut 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.060
 the Valencian museum 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.650
 drafting modernity 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.430
 humanist and libertarian that is located the youngest museum in the city its 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.730
 permanent exhibition is an adventure through thought 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.699
 human 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.299
 that does not leave anyone indifferent 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 please 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 please 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.969
 the restlessness of the human mind 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.279
 discover the philosophical foundations of everything that surrounds us 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.719
 The alma mater of this journey shows how man is 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.939
 using various means of communication to express themselves 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.409
 from the printing 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.890
 the most modern digital techniques
