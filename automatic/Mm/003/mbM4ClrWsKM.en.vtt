00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.090
 It's me 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.640
 why 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello friends how are you welcome to 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.639
 channel and good guys this time 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.250
 let's talk about minecraft and 0.11 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.750
 point 1 alpha will 12 if people and it comes 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.820
 nothing more and nothing less than this then more 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.740
 come out that not because the will 12 or the build 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.600
 and the build or is going to leave this Monday or 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.650
 Tuesday the 20th and why do I tell you this because 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.920
 this would be what europe the last 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.800
 back and because they think I'm going to the 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.990
 last because the truth because there is still 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.760
 points that will annoy you and for 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.400
 that I imagine has gone expensive for 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.659
 the will 12 is 99 percent of 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.670
 probability that it is something of rafaela 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.680
 will 12 also that in the versions 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.900
 previous has left until the will 12 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.940
 but good guys I also do this 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.530
 video because I have asked for several if 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.809
 will go out may by the demanding windows 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.010
 is going to be the will 12 and so good what 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.449
 good is that he was elected to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.760
 2012 to make it a final version 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.409
 because when the bulls come out that 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 build to launch what is the version 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.729
 final and after launching the version 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.440
 final we will be more stable and will 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.000
 to have many servers with mini-games and 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.310
 all that that the truth that they will be 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.290
 but very parents who add reserve and 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.580
 very boys I also want to tell you that 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.420
 I can not send greetings to all 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.759

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.650
 in our videos because they are many and 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.020
 I'm going to send them in a video 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.700
 past that I did sending greetings but not 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.710
 Cell girls will be what you are 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.820

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.950
 you are informing if you are seeing 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.869

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.490
 [Music] 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.440
 then the truth would be very cool 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.880

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.470
