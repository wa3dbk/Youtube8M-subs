00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello very good to all I am maximum and 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.890
 we are here in a new video is a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.080
 new location of peyote we are 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.970
 here in campaign mode with franklin and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.040
 We are on the Ferris wheel, we throw ourselves around 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.620
 like 6 watching I know it doing a little 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.389
 aggressive throwing me off we're going to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.820
 ask us down here we have to come 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.880
 right around here and you will see from 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.680
 far a peyote I'm wrong here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480
 but you see the little white dot that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.430
 you are seeing that superior we can 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 approaching us we can become 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.009
 any aquatic animal we can not be 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.420
 a shark blankets a whale where the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.730
 end we can be any kind of animal 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.719
 and well I in this case I became 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.460
 a blanket I was a blanket and I do not know no no 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.989
 I had nothing to attack or anything I did not have 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.329
 nothing to do but could only 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.960
 give ax to swim so this this animal 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.969
 It was a bit boring that it was good for you 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.710
 lucky to see which one could touch you so 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.170
 well I was here trying a little bit to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.289
 see what how how the blanket works like 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.840
 as it was an aquatic animal as it went there 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.910
 you were cool and here we see how 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.339
 we are going back to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.000
 the peyote that keeps us and I go back to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.440
 bring and eat it and now when 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.280
 I truly become a 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.870
 shark on an animal or a killer 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.640
 aquatic there we are seeing how it is 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.590
 hallucinating attract planking as not as 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 always and here we have our shark 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.479
 a murderer wanted to turn me into 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.979
 I always say this animal always 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.130
 hackers can do this but 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.960
 us not so this is a very idea 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.450
 cool that has taken roster that you can 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 become all kinds of animals com 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.649
 and do not you the peyotes these 27 in all 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.420
 the map distributed and good in the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.729
 location I think that is not enough 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.060
 missing that I put it is just below 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.259
 of the Ferris wheel and you can attack with 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750
 this animal is stable as you are seeing 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.670
 and it 's biting you're shaking and it's 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 a pretty pretty good animal 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.880
 he really liked this animal and you know 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.220
 If you want to become an animal 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.229
 aquatic killer a shark or want 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.940
 to walk that to be a little you want 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.440
 Take a walk under the sea without 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.630
 drown you well this is a good 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.789
 solution a good way to go to the water 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.649
 I advise you one thing do not get close to 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.060
 the banks and 6 some kind of animal 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.979
 aquatic because 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 you die you go near it directly 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
 franklin again become not 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.739
 you can get out of the water so nothing else 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.209
