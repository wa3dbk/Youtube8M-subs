 your beloved king is endowed with a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.240
 wire mesh filter that protects the 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.460
 functioning over time for his 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.309
 maintenance it is sufficient to unscrew the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 wash it under a jet of water 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.789
 screw the programmer to the tap 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.239
 squeezing the upper ring well with 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.280
 hands without using tools insert 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.949
 the feeding tube in the special one 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.949
 fitting and connect it to the programmer 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.130
 press the two side buttons open 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.710

 9 volt alkaline is very important 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.520
 use a new battery at each start 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.650
 season 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 insert the battery in the battery holder 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.140
 housing replace the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 cover with light pressure 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 just connected to the battery the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.620
 display lights up the valve opens 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.790
 for two seconds and the programmer will

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.630
 open the tap 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.150
 programming takes place with only three 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.119
 buttons and a large display by pressing the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.049
 once the time has been set press enter 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.170
 press the forward arrow to 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.190
 display the program one press 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.380
 inter and the arrows back and forth to 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.200

 closing for example 10 and 35 per 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.110
 set the program two press the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.069
 arrow forward and proceed as in the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.069
 program 1 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.170
 press the forward arrow to set 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.890
 the weekly schedule press 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.739
 enter to enter the programming 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.750
 day 1 coincides with the day in 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.720
 which the tax the first program of 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.659
 irrigation eg Thursday to press 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.870
 enter and select the days in which you 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.010
 would like to suspend irrigation 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.950

 example two friday and 5 monday 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.739
 after programming, align the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.739
 cursor under ex inter and 3 mary inter 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.750
 press the forward arrow to 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.530
 display the manual function press 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.900
 enter to activate the function by pressing 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.970
 the back arrow opens the valve 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.620
 of the programmer by pressing the arrow 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.440
 forward the secure valve to press enter 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.000
 to exit the setting 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.220
 this function is useful for performing 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.669
 an irrigation when it is reputed 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.190
 necessary without canceling the programs 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:28.530
 in each case the valve is set 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.530
 it closes automatically after 15 minutes 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.110
 to view i 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.009
 set programs press the arrow 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.009
 forward 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.840
 the programmer is set up for the 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.479
 connection to the rain sensor 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.000
 wayne sensor that interrupts the program 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.030
 in case of precipitation and resumes it 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.660
 when it returns a good time is 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.040
 just use the appropriate socket 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.560
 removing the protection jumper 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.220
 pre installed without using any 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.220
 awaited 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.580
 at the end of the irrigation period 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:32.069
 before the winter frosts arrive 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.509
 remove the programmer from the tap 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:37.090
 remove the battery and return it to a 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.789
 place sheltered from frost and humidity 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.039
 in this way the programmer will last 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.039
 many springs always like new 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.400
