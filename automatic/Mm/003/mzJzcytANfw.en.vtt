00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.140 
but I had a visceral reaction to it and
I<00:02:05.290> have<00:02:05.410> goose<00:02:05.710> bumps<00:02:05.740> him<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.790> know<00:02:06.910> or

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
I have goose bumps him you know or

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.400 
I have goose bumps him you know or
something<00:02:07.420> emotional<00:02:07.960> happens<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
something emotional happens in the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.200 
something emotional happens in the
script<00:02:08.649> life<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.399> realize<00:02:09.729> I'm<00:02:09.880> crying

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
script life and I realize I'm crying

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.820 
script life and I realize I'm crying
whatever<00:02:10.780> I've<00:02:10.899> already<00:02:11.050> reached<00:02:11.320> for<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> pen

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
whatever I've already reached for a pen

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.010 
whatever I've already reached for a pen
and<00:02:12.070> I'm<00:02:12.370> already<00:02:12.520> making<00:02:12.730> notes<00:02:13.180> that's<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and I'm already making notes that's the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.670 
and I'm already making notes that's the
drive<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.590> look<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.130> as<00:02:15.370> an<00:02:16.030> actor<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.680> but

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
drive I look for as an actor and but

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.960 
drive I look for as an actor and but
this<00:02:17.830> was<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> different<00:02:18.370> thing<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.850> was

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
this was a different thing that was

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.420 
this was a different thing that was
going<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.570> simultaneously<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:21.160> other

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
going on but simultaneously this other

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.820 
going on but simultaneously this other
voice<00:02:21.760> was<00:02:22.060> kind<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.450> taking<00:02:23.170> control<00:02:23.380> of

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
voice was kind of taking control of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.010 
voice was kind of taking control of
everything<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:24.790> notes<00:02:25.600> about<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
everything not just notes about the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.500 
everything not just notes about the
character<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.620> was<00:02:26.740> being<00:02:26.920> asked<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.160> play

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
character that I was being asked to play

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.270 
character that I was being asked to play
but<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.600> was<00:02:28.630> emphasizing<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:29.620> my<00:02:29.740> mind<00:02:30.010> was

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
but it was emphasizing in my mind was

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.500 
but it was emphasizing in my mind was
going<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:30.550> that's<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.880> very<00:02:31.060> important<00:02:31.480> thing

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
going like that's a very important thing

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.550 
going like that's a very important thing
maybe<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.989> needs<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.260> little<00:02:32.350> bit<00:02:32.470> of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
maybe that needs a little bit of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.410 
maybe that needs a little bit of
strengthening<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.700> my<00:02:33.850> dialogue<00:02:34.239> for

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
strengthening just like my dialogue for

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.180 
strengthening just like my dialogue for
that<00:02:34.510> character<00:02:34.750> goes<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.320> disconnects

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
that character goes on and disconnects

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.800 
that character goes on and disconnects
to<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.730> there<00:02:36.850> was<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.060> whole<00:02:37.750> other

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
to that and there was this whole other

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.620 
to that and there was this whole other
process<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.800> was<00:02:38.890> going<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.640> realized

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
process that was going on I realized

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.540 
process that was going on I realized
when<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.959> finished<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.470> apart<00:02:42.220> from<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.520> fact

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
when I finished it apart from the fact

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.570 
when I finished it apart from the fact
that<00:02:42.730> I've<00:02:42.880> loved<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.480> story<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.489> wanted<00:02:45.489> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
that I've loved the story I wanted to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.670 
that I've loved the story I wanted to
take<00:02:45.700> responsibility<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.810> wanted<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
take responsibility for it I wanted the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.979 
take responsibility for it I wanted the
whole<00:02:47.920> entire<00:02:48.489> thing<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:49.690> be<00:02:49.810> my

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
whole entire thing to be my

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.110 
whole entire thing to be my
responsibility
