00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
all I'm going to do okay the key areas

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.520 
all I'm going to do okay the key areas
of<00:01:58.470> running<00:01:59.100> predominantly<00:02:00.030> technique

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
of running predominantly technique

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.990 
of running predominantly technique
that's<00:02:01.530> where'd<00:02:02.400> you<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.760> first

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that's where'd you get the first

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
that's where'd you get the first
improvement<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.350> makes<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.920> perform

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
improvement that then makes to perform

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.120 
improvement that then makes to perform
the<00:02:05.520> feel<00:02:05.790> better<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.480> is<00:02:06.780> key<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.050> do<00:02:07.440> other

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
the feel better and is key to do other

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.340 
the feel better and is key to do other
things<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.700> need<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.940> change<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.600> way<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.200> you

about<00:04:10.330> eighty-five<00:04:11.140> percent<00:04:11.580> hopefully<00:04:12.580> over

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
about eighty-five percent hopefully over

the<00:04:12.970> next<00:04:13.060> few<00:04:13.300> weeks<00:04:13.540> get<00:04:14.290> faster<00:04:14.800> keep

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
the next few weeks get faster keep

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.370 
the next few weeks get faster keep
improving<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:15.880> that's<00:04:16.330> the<00:04:16.450> family<00:04:16.870> what

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
improving and that's the family what

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
xor few weeks ish through work hard but

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.390 
xor few weeks ish through work hard but
hopefully<00:04:25.150> see<00:04:25.480> some<00:04:25.630> good<00:04:25.690> results<00:04:26.400> i'm

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
hopefully see some good results i'm

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.610 
hopefully see some good results i'm
going<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.700> make<00:04:27.820> them<00:04:27.940> stronger<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.630> when<00:04:29.530> you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
going to make them stronger and when you

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.830 
going to make them stronger and when you
make<00:04:29.740> them<00:04:29.919> more<00:04:30.040> explosive<00:04:30.640> which<00:04:31.419> all<00:04:31.630> are

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
make them more explosive which all are

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.710 
make them more explosive which all are
