 hello people about the accamargo you are 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.330
 in the distance and I'll respond to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.850
 tag writing habits that mt earned was 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.760
 the target cheer for geek freak channel 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.160
 freak because it is he who actually does 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 long time he tagged me or more or 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.410
 At least one year, dear cheerer looks at my 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 eyes 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.660
 Please I pray for your forgiveness. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 who does not know this tag with himself 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 name says she talks about our 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.370
 writing habits ie it is a tag 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.920
 for whom he writes his own 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 stories your own books or 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 Whatever you like to write about there 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 but I already said this on the canal maybe 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.500
 said maybe I do not remember anymore 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 since I'm very young I have 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.579
 an overwhelming desire to publish a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.440
 book with 10 11 years or so I 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.300
 I had it in my heart and something that I 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 I intend to fulfill in my life because 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.100
 really is a dream of a life then 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 I read a book I was there and thought a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.920
 similar story that I thought was 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.689
 my story but it was actually a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 copy of the other stories I gave you 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.710
 I wrote my story doing the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 illustrations make my booklets and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.790
 with 10 and 11 years or so I 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 I started to write really did my 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.330
 first poem I was 10 years old and with 12 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.820
 years I wrote my first book of 70 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.380
 and a few pages and then I 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.570
 I always wrote and I had friends. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.299
 They wanted what I wrote then. 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.520
 this is something that has been part of me since c 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.350
 and now I'm going to answer the tag 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.740
 It's true, I'm going to stop the chatter. 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.659
 I promise you the first question typed or 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.430
 handwritten then this is a question 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.850
 complicated because I really like the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.189
 two 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.869
 most of the story is typed but 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.090
 there are some parts that I feel 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.280
 need to write by hand that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 paper is a scrawl we were of things in the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.899
 computer 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.570
 I kinda got toc, I do not know, but there's 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.149
 that everything is all right milimetrically 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.179
 with spacing certain paragraphs as 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.890
 things and you know I can not make a 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.420
 draft on the computer, I have to 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.330
 make the sketch on paper 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.180
 Yeah, I know 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.800
 strange handwriting or letter 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.570
 I feel like my 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.100
 ideas went faster when I do 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.860
 in letter form 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.280
 Show your favorite pen is there. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.710
 favorite pen where you like 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.800
 write anywhere comes a 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.540
 idea is right there that I'm going to write 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.130
 If I had to write, I would not 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.980
 the deep despair our sorrows 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.840
 which are the five preferred authors in 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.790
 terms of authorial style and voice 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.310
 first of them is brenda the enderson 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.650
 which is what wrote misty born and 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.350
 elantra the two books that I love 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.760
 All of my heart if I'm one day. 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.209
 a little of what he is 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.270
 I will feel top top 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.850
 then there is the pet shop ness he the reason 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.930
 and how it surrounds you with the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.620
 words and touches you close that ness is the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.060
 face 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.800
 we have in this list we have a 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.890
 another national also that rafael 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.209
 I read his perfect book days. 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.660
 which is a very contradictory book to 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.310
 people who love people who hate more 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.769
 independent of the story itself I want 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.190
 say how it will work the 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.260
 psychological character of the character is extremely 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.239
 is addictive even though sometimes 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.880
 you get angry at some things in the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.430
 story continues reading because he 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.980
 involves in a way with words and 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.820
 within the mind of the protagonist who is 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.250
 odd 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.200
 I would like to have this ability the author 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.450
 national list is the day that 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.190
 I already told him about it here times will not go 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.750
 have a review of his books here on the channel 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.310
 it has a simpler writing and 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.800
 When I say simpler and I do not want 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.560
 say that it is inferior to others 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.019
 authors is that his style of writing and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.600
 same book is for another audience is 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.400
 different but I quite like the 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.830
 style of his characters who are 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.320
 always half do not know if he puts many 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.570
 references in his work I think that 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.850
 very cool, you know I 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.250
 I have a great affection for myself and 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.400
 This is it, my reference yard is 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.250
 funk style he writes terror but not 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.530
 terrorist terror found like most 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.780
 of people can think who has not read 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.240
 Of course, when I was there, I 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.760
 king characters are the ones you 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.090
 do not know if they will cross too 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.850
 happening is a mix yes you 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.669
 literally enters the head 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.070
 of those characters and I think it's incredible 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.889
 and it's the best thing in books that 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.940
 Have you participated in nano raimo already? 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.960
 Yes, I won, I tried to participate more 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.700
 I did not win 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.130
 Do not write the same thing that you tell me. 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.530
 This is it, I will not read the whole country. 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.960
 Grace, I like to write because I 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.120
 I like to write but it's very 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.680
 interesting for you to acquire discipline 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.650
 lately he's been trying to discipline me 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.350
 to write 500 words a day for 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.620
 less then it's almost a car on hi mom 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.380
 Did you ever have anything published, not me? 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.030
 I have had something published as close as 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.210
 I got there when I won a 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.100
 poetry contest and guaçu mogi I had 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.120
 about 15 years or so I applied 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.430
 by mail and such and I won is in two 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.370
 places first in sixth place 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.190
 with two different poems look who only 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.840
 diego in the poet and they got the poems 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.630
 that people will write did a 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.430
 anthology and left a library 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.500
 So I do not think it counts as the 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.900
 published but has a long way to go. 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.270
 my new part of the level 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.789
 of mogi guaçu in which projects 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.039
 Are you working now so this is? 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.770
 a complicated question because it varies 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.590
 a lot of things lately I'm kind of 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.620
 without inspiration for one thing I only write 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.530
 something or other but I'll come back anyway 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.350
 This exact moment I'm writing 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.750
 a tale I gave the name for now 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.440
 Daughter of the night I do not know if it's going 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.840
 continue being this name but it is a tale 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.660
 by an anthology one 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.820
 I'll send a contest that only 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.919
 soundtrack for the moments of 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.250
 writing I do not have a soundtrack 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.830
 Why write listening does not leave me 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.600
 think so I'd rather be just with 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.210
 my true thoughts I do not 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.000
 I necessarily write listening to music 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.010
 I listen to music to write. 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.660
 good people and until it ends here 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.490
 I hope you 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.170
 have enjoyed seeing this tag I hope 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.140
 that twitter has forgiven me because 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.760
 took almost a year to answer for 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.680
 from victor by 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.630
 I forgot you have not registered yet 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.180
 on the channel, do not forget to write 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.760
 like liked this video 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.760
 to help spread the word and see you again 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.370
 tomorrow in another video split every day 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.560
 Because you do not have a name for it, right? 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.560
 A kiss for everyone, and such.
