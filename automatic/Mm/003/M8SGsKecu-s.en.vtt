00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.000
 if you take this itc 3100 the duke 3110 the new diagnosis system 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.179
 checks and cleaning of petrol injectors in the home 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.599
 composed of two different work units allows working both on 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.000
 1 point multipoint petrol injectors after inside bag 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.230
 you are on injectors with direct injection and type yourself 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.149
 thanks special mediaset it is also possible to work on the gas injectors 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.149
 text 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.150
 for car repair shops it is essential to have a single versatile tool 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 hey simple to use hello 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.600
 ptc 3103 equipped with hours in standard for petrol injectors that allows to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 cover only what 90% of the car fleet is 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.320
 me 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.450
 thanks to the help of additional o'riley wanted it is possible to go to cover the 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.450
 totality of the situations present on the market 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 working with the itc 3100 system is really easy, just disassemble it 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.630
 the injectors of the vehicle to place them in the appropriate door compartment 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 injectors 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.870
 select the type of vehicle engine and enter a few additional data 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.270
 engine rpm and power the number of injectors 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.479
 this operation 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.479
 can be conducted automatically or manually 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.320
 itc 3100 then begins with the preliminary calculation of the injector flow rates 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 innovative and exclusive functions 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.890
 allows to adjust the flow test according to the specific capacity 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.049
 mounted delineator avoiding the leakage of liquid 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.660
 the tool proposes three operating methods 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.030
 diagnostic 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.979
 a 7 standard pre-set head 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.139
 manual to perform only certain heads 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:16.289
 ooh customized where the operator can memorize up to 5 practice sessions 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.719
 before each test itc 3100 automatically performs a test for the 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.930
 measurement of the resistance to the wind voice through an integrated ohmmeter 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.220
 this operation allows the preliminary identification of any 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.479
 defects of an obvious injector 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:37.699
 itc 3100 is able to perform the leak test to highlight problems 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.209
 of pressure loss or hassle 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.219
 flow feasts to highlight any supply imbalances 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.379
 fuel between the injectors 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.379
 and heads of songs i'm 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.090
 it is also possible to act by unblocking the injectors in the event of 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.090
 volturation from dirt 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:07.179
 the LEDs are positioned behind the burettes and allow you to observe carefully 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.579
 fuel delivery dynamics during tests 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:17.409
 once the tests have been completed, it is possible to proceed with the injector washing phase with 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.359
 the aid of the duke 3110 unit 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.049
 aul cleaning system between heated liquid sounds 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.319
 the special liquid of heads and police were developed by brainbee 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.809
 specifically to ensure maximum cleanliness in the absence of aggression 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.499
 for the plastic rubber parts of the injectors 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:43.260
 simply place the atp c3100 injectors still in the tray 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.179
 duke 3110 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.869
 and activate the appropriate wash command on itc 3100 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.120
 washing cycle completed 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.420
 we advise repeating in the head so as to check ip to prove its effectiveness 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.689
 of the intervention below
