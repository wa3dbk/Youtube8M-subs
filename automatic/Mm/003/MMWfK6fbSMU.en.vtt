now and he had these in his toyota sold
them<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.890> isaac<00:01:43.370> and<00:01:43.550> then<00:01:43.670> Isaac<00:01:44.030> hasn't<00:01:44.630> been

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
them to isaac and then Isaac hasn't been

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.350

able<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:45.370> get<00:01:46.370> anything<00:01:46.550> going<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:49.090> use<00:01:50.090> them

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360

give these as 300 watts of peace 150

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.850 
give these as 300 watts of peace 150
coil<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:13.220> pretty<00:02:13.430> much<00:02:13.519> got<00:02:13.850> him

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
coil so and I pretty much got him

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.470 
coil so and I pretty much got him
because<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.040> 15<00:02:16.580> here<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.480> so

soft it's just it's not even funny it
actually<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.890> sounds<00:02:25.130> bad<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.820> mean<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:26.480> lost

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
actually it sounds bad I mean it's lost

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.710 
actually it sounds bad I mean it's lost
so<00:02:27.380> much<00:02:27.560> suspension<00:02:28.160> compliance<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.940> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
so much suspension compliance that the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.650 
so much suspension compliance that the
cone<00:02:30.040> almost<00:02:31.040> moves<00:02:31.430> just<00:02:31.850> by<00:02:32.060> flipping<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
cone almost moves just by flipping the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.320 
cone almost moves just by flipping the
speaker<00:02:33.019> over<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.500> mean<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.519> suspension<00:02:35.090> moves

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
speaker over I mean the suspension moves

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.430 
speaker over I mean the suspension moves
just<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.750> weight<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.110> cone<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.970> I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
just with the weight of the cone so I

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.660 
just with the weight of the cone so I
can't<00:02:39.440> even<00:02:39.560> hit<00:02:39.769> any<00:02:39.950> low<00:02:40.130> notes<00:02:40.370> with<00:02:40.519> that

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
can't even hit any low notes with that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.690 
can't even hit any low notes with that
and<00:02:40.850> just<00:02:40.970> over<00:02:41.600> excursions<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.440> crazy<00:02:43.310> so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
and just over excursions like crazy so

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.900 
and just over excursions like crazy so
the<00:02:44.570> guy<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.930> had<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.650> used<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.610> cheap

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
like my 12 for that purpose so dual

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.090 
like my 12 for that purpose so dual
4-ohm<00:03:53.130> each<00:03:54.130> wire<00:03:54.550> 28<00:03:54.970> all<00:03:55.680> parallel<00:03:56.680> down<00:03:56.890> to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
4-ohm each wire 28 all parallel down to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.130 
4-ohm each wire 28 all parallel down to
two<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:59.020> works<00:03:59.860> out<00:04:00.010> pretty<00:04:00.220> good<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:01.540> was<00:04:02.020> just
