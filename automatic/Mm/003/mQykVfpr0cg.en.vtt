in a horizontal direction so basically
you<00:02:37.160> did<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.460> in<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.640> vertical<00:02:37.820> direction<00:02:38.510> where

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
you did it in a vertical direction where

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.480 
you did it in a vertical direction where
the<00:02:38.690> cards<00:02:39.050> are<00:02:39.200> here<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:40.010> do<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.370> a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
the cards are here and do it in a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.270 
the cards are here and do it in a
vertical<00:02:40.670> direction<00:02:41.300> where<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:41.660> right<00:02:41.870> here

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
vertical direction where it's right here

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.510 
vertical direction where it's right here
ok<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.610> side<00:02:44.320> okay<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.860> need<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.070> do<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.370> in

swing<00:02:54.710> cut<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.730> if<00:02:56.090> one<00:02:56.510> hand<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.140> worse<00:02:57.680> than

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
swing cut so if one hand is worse than

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.560 
swing cut so if one hand is worse than
the<00:02:58.160> other<00:02:58.490> hand<00:02:58.700> when<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:58.970> swing<00:02:59.150> put<00:02:59.360> that's

the other hand when you swing put that's
okay<00:02:59.960> because<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:01.100> cards<00:03:01.460> will<00:03:01.670> naturally<00:03:01.910> go

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
okay because the cards will naturally go

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.970 
okay because the cards will naturally go

diagonal jog it for this packet

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.100 
diagonal jog it for this packet
so<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.090> open<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:24.350> like<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:25.780> rotate<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.900> and

so just open it like that rotate it and
then<00:04:28.040> diagonal<00:04:28.880> jog<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.360> card<00:04:29.630> so<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.110> the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
then diagonal jog the card so that the

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.250 
then diagonal jog the card so that the
arm<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:30.889> right<00:04:31.130> here<00:04:31.720> like<00:04:32.720> so<00:04:33.729> okay<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:36.020> this

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
arm is right here like so okay so this

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.469 
arm is right here like so okay so this
is<00:04:36.410> what<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.740> looks<00:04:37.010> like<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.669> most<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.180> we

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.529 
you're going to place this packet on top
again<00:04:58.360> holding<00:04:59.360> this<00:05:00.080> packet<00:05:00.760> intact<00:05:01.760> like<00:05:02.270> so

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
again holding this packet intact like so

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.800 
again holding this packet intact like so
and<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:03.020> are<00:05:03.260> basically<00:05:03.770> done<00:05:03.979> with<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.220> cut

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
and you are basically done with the cut

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.300 
and you are basically done with the cut
so<00:05:05.810> again<00:05:06.550> top<00:05:07.550> half<00:05:08.139> cut<00:05:09.139> make<00:05:09.979> sure<00:05:10.130> you'll

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
so again top half cut make sure you'll

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.180 
so again top half cut make sure you'll
know<00:05:10.550> this<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.090> on<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.360> top<00:05:11.510> half<00:05:12.010> swing<00:05:13.010> cut

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
know this is on the top half swing cut

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.740 
know this is on the top half swing cut
diagonal<00:05:14.150> diagonal<00:05:14.690> jog<00:05:15.310> like<00:05:16.310> this<00:05:19.750> place

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
diagonal diagonal jog like this place

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.689 
diagonal diagonal jog like this place
the<00:05:21.080> bottom<00:05:21.470> packet<00:05:21.800> that's<00:05:21.919> diagonal<00:05:22.460> job

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
the bottom packet that's diagonal job

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.550 
the bottom packet that's diagonal job
holding<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:23.750> with<00:05:24.350> this<00:05:24.620> hand<00:05:24.880> okay<00:05:26.139> that's<00:05:27.139> I

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
holding it with this hand okay that's I

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.460 
holding it with this hand okay that's I
jogged<00:05:27.950> and<00:05:28.250> place<00:05:28.820> it<00:05:29.030> right<00:05:29.479> here<00:05:29.780> and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
jogged and place it right here and

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.510 
jogged and place it right here and
holding<00:05:30.889> this<00:05:31.400> packet<00:05:32.090> like<00:05:32.419> so<00:05:33.460> like<00:05:34.460> this

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
holding this packet like so like this

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.080 
holding this packet like so like this
that's<00:05:37.520> pretty<00:05:37.700> much<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:38.289> so<00:05:39.289> here's<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:40.090> show

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
that's pretty much it so here's a show

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.379 
that's pretty much it so here's a show
over<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.599> shoulder<00:05:41.990> view<00:05:42.970> so<00:05:43.970> here's<00:05:44.210> the

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
over the shoulder view so here's the

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.800 
over the shoulder view so here's the
over-the-shoulder<00:05:44.840> view<00:05:46.300> so<00:05:47.300> here's<00:05:47.510> what<00:05:47.690> it

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
over-the-shoulder view so here's what it

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:57.889 
over-the-shoulder view so here's what it
looks<00:05:48.020> like<00:05:48.229> one<00:05:48.710> former<00:05:49.220> is<00:05:49.789> holding<00:05:50.450> it

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:57.899 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:05.100 

like<00:05:58.899> that<00:05:59.110> ok<00:06:00.099> so<00:06:00.759> again<00:06:01.469> it's<00:06:02.469> intact<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:04.110> by

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
like that ok so again it's intact and by

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.839 
like that ok so again it's intact and by
the<00:06:05.169> way<00:06:05.379> this<00:06:05.589> is<00:06:05.649> a<00:06:05.770> false<00:06:06.039> cut<00:06:06.339> so<00:06:06.490> all<00:06:06.639> the

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
the way this is a false cut so all the

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:13.169 
the way this is a false cut so all the
cards<00:06:07.149> are<00:06:07.270> intact<00:06:07.800> so<00:06:08.909> right<00:06:09.909> here<00:06:11.939> in<00:06:12.939> class

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:13.179 
cards are intact so right here in class

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:17.100 
cards are intact so right here in class
it's<00:06:13.509> half<00:06:14.639> and<00:06:15.639> then<00:06:16.119> we<00:06:16.569> want<00:06:16.809> to<00:06:16.929> do<00:06:17.050> is

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
it's half and then we want to do is

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.480 
it's half and then we want to do is
we're<00:06:17.319> going<00:06:17.409> to<00:06:17.529> swing<00:06:17.770> cut<00:06:17.949> it<00:06:18.749> like<00:06:19.749> so<00:06:20.490> and

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490
