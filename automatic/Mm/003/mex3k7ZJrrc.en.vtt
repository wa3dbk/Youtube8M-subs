starts here so you usually you would
take<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.680> jump<00:01:47.010> over<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:48.140> Sasuke<00:01:49.790> there's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
take this jump over here Sasuke there's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.149 
take this jump over here Sasuke there's
a<00:01:50.970> there's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.690> jump<00:01:52.260> lair<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.620> for<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
a there's a jump lair you for make and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.890 
a there's a jump lair you for make and
then<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.000> incredibly<00:01:54.659> hard

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
then you have to do this incredibly hard

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.030 
then you have to do this incredibly hard
when<00:01:55.140> I'm<00:01:55.200> actually<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.650> take<00:01:55.830> off

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
when I'm actually going to take off

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.190 
when I'm actually going to take off
blaze<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.330> means<00:01:57.600> i<00:01:57.720> can't<00:01:57.900> shift

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
blaze because it means i can't shift

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
blaze because it means i can't shift
when<00:01:58.590> I've<00:01:58.710> got<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.970> have<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> make

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
when I've got it on so you have to make

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510 
when I've got it on so you have to make
this<00:02:00.600> jump<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.100> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
this jump here on to that it's really

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.660 
this jump here on to that it's really
really<00:02:03.240> hard<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.010> course<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.310> didn't<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
really hard and of course I didn't do it

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
really hard and of course I didn't do it
so<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> great<00:02:06.840> thing<00:02:07.140> about<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so with the great thing about is if I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
so with the great thing about is if I
get<00:02:08.069> mad<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:08.970> no<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.450> to

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
get mad and I'm just like no I want to

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.300 
get mad and I'm just like no I want to
make<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.659> I<00:02:09.959> could<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.349> put<00:02:10.799> on<00:02:10.920> my<00:02:11.069> blaze

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
make this I could just put on my blaze

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.440 
make this I could just put on my blaze
thing<00:02:12.090> jump<00:02:12.629> back<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:13.079> and<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:14.150> try<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.209> jump

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
thing jump back up and then try the jump

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.190 
thing jump back up and then try the jump
again<00:02:15.689> as<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
again as a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.930 
again as a
as<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.410> i<00:02:16.440> would<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:16.980> normally<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.819> which

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
as do i would have to normally do which

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.240 
as do i would have to normally do which
was<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.360> over<00:02:18.629> here<00:02:18.840> finally<00:02:19.739> climb<00:02:20.040> out<00:02:20.220> of

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
was go over here finally climb out of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.490 
was go over here finally climb out of
the<00:02:20.370> water<00:02:20.580> slowly<00:02:21.209> drag<00:02:21.690> myself<00:02:21.930> over<00:02:22.379> to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
the water slowly drag myself over to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.080 
the water slowly drag myself over to
this<00:02:22.709> jump<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:23.280> make<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> jump<00:02:23.760> there

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
this jump and then make the jump there

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.540 
this jump and then make the jump there
and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.750> try<00:02:25.290> again<00:02:25.319> ah<00:02:26.480> bro<00:02:27.480> no<00:02:28.470> come<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.280> I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
and then try again ah bro no come on I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.640 
and then try again ah bro no come on I
can<00:02:29.700> do<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.050> was<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.470> got

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
can do this I can do this I was I got

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.650 
can do this I can do this I was I got
quite<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:32.400> actually<00:02:32.670> got<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.239> next

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
quite but I actually got to the next

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.780 
quite but I actually got to the next
segment<00:02:33.900> which<00:02:34.349> is<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.920> much<00:02:35.160> harder<00:02:35.430> than

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
segment which is so much harder than

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.940 
segment which is so much harder than
this<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.599> believe<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.530> mean<00:02:37.860> this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
this if you can believe that I mean this

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.370 
this if you can believe that I mean this
is<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:39.090> what<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> fall<00:02:39.660> book<00:02:39.900> jump<00:02:40.230> or

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
is like that what a fall book jump or

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.600 
is like that what a fall book jump or
something<00:02:40.440> are<00:02:40.709> five<00:02:40.890> block<00:02:41.160> jump<00:02:41.459> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
something are five block jump the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.910 
something are five block jump the
maximum<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.209> could<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.620> hard

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
maximum it could be and it is so hard

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.280 
maximum it could be and it is so hard
but<00:02:44.700> yeah<00:02:44.819> basically<00:02:45.000> what<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.450> means<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.989> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
but yeah basically what it means on the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.530 
but yeah basically what it means on the
servers<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.549> access<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.150> like

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
servers is that I have access to like

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.630 
servers is that I have access to like
you<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.260> classes<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.280> stuff<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.580> I

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
you know classes and stuff that I

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.220 
you know classes and stuff that I
wouldn't<00:02:50.970> usually<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.720> means<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
wouldn't usually have so it means in the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.050 
wouldn't usually have so it means in the
videos<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:52.980> hunk<00:02:53.190> games<00:02:53.489> videos<00:02:53.819> i

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
videos and the hunk games videos i

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.150 
videos and the hunk games videos i
actually<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.750> access<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.319> more<00:02:55.500> things<00:02:55.560> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
actually have access to more things and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.180 
actually have access to more things and
it<00:02:57.090> made<00:02:57.239> me<00:02:57.269> think<00:02:57.450> i<00:02:58.019> actually<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
it made me think i actually have the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.920 
it made me think i actually have the
ability<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.760> do<00:03:00.180> quite<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.450> lot<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.630> cool<00:03:00.900> stuff

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
ability to do quite a lot of cool stuff

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.740 
ability to do quite a lot of cool stuff
I<00:03:01.290> made<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.069> made<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.849> so<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.329> next<00:03:03.480> jump

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
I made it I made it so the next jump

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.500 
I made it I made it so the next jump
here<00:03:04.049> would<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.620> oh<00:03:05.310> god<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.700> forget<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.120> forget

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
here would be oh god I forget I forget

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.900 
here would be oh god I forget I forget
where<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.170> think<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:08.040> next<00:03:08.069> jump<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.670> to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
where it is I think the next jump is to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.940 
where it is I think the next jump is to
that<00:03:09.180> staircase<00:03:09.599> but<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.500> same<00:03:10.709> time<00:03:10.890> I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that staircase but at the same time I

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.330 
that staircase but at the same time I
know<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.489> not<00:03:11.880> where<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.019> where<00:03:13.560> don't

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
know it's not where is it where don't

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.309 
know it's not where is it where don't
remember<00:03:14.640> where<00:03:14.819> what<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:18.690> is

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
remember where what I like is it that is

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.470 
remember where what I like is it that is
yeas<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.430> go<00:03:20.549> then<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.060> go<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.239> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
yeas and then I go then I go to the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.990 
yeas and then I go then I go to the
staircase<00:03:21.900> from<00:03:22.170> here<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.799> then<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.459> jump<00:03:23.730> onto

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
staircase from here and then I jump onto

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.770 
staircase from here and then I jump onto
that<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:25.350> guy's<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.799> my<00:03:25.920> way<00:03:26.600> ago<00:03:27.600> he's

really good where I think raised would

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.879 
really good where I think raised would
quite<00:05:57.900> like<00:05:58.050> this<00:05:58.169> because<00:05:58.380> we<00:05:58.530> all<00:05:58.620> know<00:05:58.770> how

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
quite like this because we all know how

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.650 
quite like this because we all know how
much<00:05:59.070> of<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.250> fan<00:05:59.430> he<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.669> of<00:05:59.850> doing<00:06:00.030> parkour<00:06:00.450> and

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
much of a fan he is of doing parkour and

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.450 
much of a fan he is of doing parkour and
then<00:06:00.750> not<00:06:00.930> stopping<00:06:01.410> basically<00:06:02.100> if<00:06:02.160> you<00:06:02.280> do

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
then not stopping basically if you do

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.580 
then not stopping basically if you do
the<00:06:02.550> park<00:06:02.760> on<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.180> stunts<00:06:03.419> till<00:06:03.750> it<00:06:04.139> kicks<00:06:04.410> you
