00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
first but that's halfway up the RPM

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.790 
first but that's halfway up the RPM
range<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.510> if<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.689> flip<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> throttle<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
little bit not very forgiving it makes a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
little bit not very forgiving it makes a
lot<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.960> power<00:00:31.140> immediately<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.040> spins<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
lot of power immediately and spins the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.880 
lot of power immediately and spins the
rear<00:00:32.700> tire<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.020> Hill<00:00:34.260> claims<00:00:34.590> they're<00:00:34.860> a

rear tire you know Hill claims they're a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.170 
rear tire you know Hill claims they're a
lot<00:00:35.040> harder<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.460> you're<00:00:35.550> spinning<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> tire

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
lot harder when you're spinning the tire

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.690 
lot harder when you're spinning the tire
I<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.750> traction<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.160> ride<00:00:38.340> around<00:00:38.460> in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
I want traction but if I ride around in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
etc and if I'm always one gear higher

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
etc and if I'm always one gear higher
then<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.200> helps<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.980> climbing

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
then it really helps out on climbing

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.790 
then it really helps out on climbing
hills<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.180> terrain<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> where<00:00:49.680> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
hills and terrain like this where you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.160 
hills and terrain like this where you
have<00:00:49.980> less<00:00:50.219> control<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.360> know

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
have less control because you know

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
have less control because you know
there's<00:00:52.500> gravel<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> stuff<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.640> spin

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
there's gravel and stuff you could spin

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.639 
there's gravel and stuff you could spin
easily<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.480> really<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.350> gear

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
easily you really want to be one gear

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.840 
easily you really want to be one gear
higher<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.520> helps<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
higher it just helps out a lot so that
