00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.520
 welcome to calorie recipes 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.360
 today we prepare the prawns au gratin in 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.620
 oven ingredients are clean and shrimp 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.510
 bushati breadcrumbs extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.420
 olive pink pepper salt and dry white wine 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.820
 you need to prepare this recipe 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.519
 I used some tiny pyrex dishes 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.640
 steel dishes cannot be made 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.850
 use both in glass and in ceramic 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.160
 the important thing is that they are single function 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.680
 so since the portions are for two 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.010
 people I took two now 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.899
 pour a dash of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 olive on the bottom of one and we notice 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:56.730
 so one day when done 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 this operation we dust the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 bottom in the pan with a little 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.730
 bread crumbs 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.990
 so let's go and arrange the prawns 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.520
 we try to put them as much as possible 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.520
 one next to the other 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:25.390
 once placed shrimp we are one 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.979
 sprinkled with pink pepper each together 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:37.030
 Rocchi has also pulverized with a little 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:39.520
 of salt we come with a little white wine 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 dry using a teaspoon because it does not 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.840
 a lot goes so I would say that 1 the dose 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:56.229
 just two teaspoons each 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:02:01.530
 na placements pour a wire even 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:06.450
 finally, extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.450
 pulverize with grated bread 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:20.730
 our shrimp are ready to be 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:23.280
 informed at 220 degrees for 5 minutes in 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.100

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.510

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.190
