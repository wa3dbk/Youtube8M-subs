the box here we go we have a sheet of

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.849 
the box here we go we have a sheet of
instructions<00:00:28.449> that<00:00:28.720> tell<00:00:28.900> us<00:00:29.230> all<00:00:29.500> we<00:00:29.650> need<00:00:29.830> to

sheet are very lovely transfers decals

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.799 
sheet are very lovely transfers decals
that<00:00:35.559> will<00:00:35.769> basically<00:00:36.280> adorn<00:00:37.210> our<00:00:37.420> model<00:00:37.720> make

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
that will basically adorn our model make

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.000 
that will basically adorn our model make
look<00:00:37.960> very<00:00:38.229> pretty

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
look very pretty

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.009 
look very pretty
let<00:00:39.460> me<00:00:39.610> up<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.760> wings<00:00:39.940> wing<00:00:40.479> comes<00:00:40.720> in<00:00:40.870> two

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
let me up the wings wing comes in two

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.320 
let me up the wings wing comes in two
halves<00:00:41.650> like<00:00:42.250> most<00:00:42.460> wings<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:42.970> fits<00:00:43.180> in<00:00:43.269> the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
halves like most wings so fits in the

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.360 
halves like most wings so fits in the
box<00:00:43.479> easier<00:00:43.839> I'll<00:00:44.680> just<00:00:44.860> glue<00:00:44.949> those<00:00:45.159> together

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
box easier I'll just glue those together

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.070 
box easier I'll just glue those together
like<00:00:45.699> that<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.330> what<00:00:46.510> I'm<00:00:46.600> going<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:46.839> do

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
like that and what I'm going to do

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.210 
like that and what I'm going to do
because<00:00:47.229> they're<00:00:47.440> gonna<00:00:47.530> put<00:00:47.680> a<00:00:47.710> post-it<00:00:48.159> on

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
because they're gonna put a post-it on

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.710 
because they're gonna put a post-it on
this<00:00:48.369> thing<00:00:48.549> the<00:00:48.909> pocket<00:00:49.239> will<00:00:49.330> mount<00:00:49.540> over

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
this thing the pocket will mount over

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.930 
this thing the pocket will mount over
the<00:00:49.930> wing<00:00:50.080> so<00:00:50.260> I'm<00:00:50.320> going<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.650> build<00:00:51.100> an<00:00:51.309> amount

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
the wing so I'm going to build an amount

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.850 
the wing so I'm going to build an amount
for<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.600> pulse-jet<00:00:52.839> before<00:00:53.350> we<00:00:53.500> put<00:00:53.680> these

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
for the pulse-jet before we put these

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.380 
for the pulse-jet before we put these
two<00:00:54.010> halves<00:00:54.220> together<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:54.760> that<00:00:55.150> will<00:00:55.239> give

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
two halves together and that will give

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.710 
two halves together and that will give
us<00:00:55.420> somewhere<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.470> fix<00:00:56.830> our<00:00:57.159> engine<00:00:57.720> most

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
us somewhere to a fix our engine most

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.640 
us somewhere to a fix our engine most
important<00:00:59.250> now<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:01.030> next<00:01:01.239> layer<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.479> this<00:01:01.839> box

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
important now the next layer of this box

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.109 
important now the next layer of this box
of<00:01:03.010> stuff<00:01:03.150> contains<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.970> tailfins

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
of stuff contains the tailfins

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.560 
of stuff contains the tailfins
with<00:01:07.930> they're<00:01:08.170> yet<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.070> be<00:01:09.370> glued<00:01:09.610> on<00:01:09.850> rudders

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
with they're yet to be glued on rudders

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.990 
with they're yet to be glued on rudders
and<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:12.070> not<00:01:12.250> quite<00:01:12.400> sure<00:01:12.430> but<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.700> may

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
and I'm not quite sure but I may

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.730 
and I'm not quite sure but I may
actually<00:01:13.270> dispense<00:01:13.840> with<00:01:14.200> rudder<00:01:14.500> as<00:01:14.710> a

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
actually dispense with rudder as a

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.130 
actually dispense with rudder as a
control<00:01:15.160> surface<00:01:15.340> because<00:01:15.970> models<00:01:16.900> like<00:01:16.990> this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
control surface because models like this

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.440 
control surface because models like this
generally<00:01:17.410> Bank<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.490> yank<00:01:18.700> oiler<00:01:19.420> and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
generally Bank and yank oiler and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.330 
generally Bank and yank oiler and
elevator<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.290> don't<00:01:20.500> need<00:01:20.800> rudder<00:01:21.070> in<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
elevator you don't need rudder in the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.890 
elevator you don't need rudder in the
air<00:01:21.520> rudders<00:01:22.030> handy<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.390> ground<00:01:22.660> but<00:01:22.750> this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
air rudders handy on the ground but this

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.300 
air rudders handy on the ground but this
has<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.080> steerable<00:01:23.440> nose<00:01:23.680> wheel<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.010> well<00:01:24.130> so

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
has a steerable nose wheel as well so

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.590 
has a steerable nose wheel as well so
there's<00:01:24.790> probably<00:01:24.910> not<00:01:25.150> much<00:01:25.270> point<00:01:25.540> in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
there's probably not much point in

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.760 
there's probably not much point in
having<00:01:25.750> rudder<00:01:25.990> because<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.440> means<00:01:26.590> we'll<00:01:26.740> be

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
having rudder because it means we'll be

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.740 
having rudder because it means we'll be
able<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.100> get<00:01:27.670> rid<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.850> some<00:01:28.000> weight<00:01:28.210> from<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
able to get rid of some weight from the

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.510 
able to get rid of some weight from the
rear<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.230> fuselage<00:01:29.680> where<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.070> don't<00:01:30.220> want

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
rear of the fuselage where we don't want

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.980 
rear of the fuselage where we don't want
it<00:01:30.670> because<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.240> CG<00:01:31.510> is<00:01:31.570> going<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.750> be<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.840> long

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
it because the CG is going to be a long

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.790 
it because the CG is going to be a long
way<00:01:32.110> back<00:01:32.290> already

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
way back already

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.260 
way back already
and<00:01:33.100> also<00:01:33.550> means<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:33.970> don't<00:01:34.030> have<00:01:34.150> to

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
and also means that we don't have to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.310 
and also means that we don't have to
worry<00:01:34.390> about<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.690> linkages<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:35.110> would

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
worry about the linkages that would

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.230 
worry about the linkages that would
otherwise<00:01:35.409> be<00:01:35.620> exposed<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.490> heat<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.970> the

it so that's a good thing we'll get rid

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.630 
it so that's a good thing we'll get rid
of<00:01:40.990> those<00:01:41.050> preps<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.800> rudder<00:01:41.980> control

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
of those preps that the rudder control

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640 
of those preps that the rudder control
yeah<00:01:43.060> we<00:01:43.240> have<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.420> tail<00:01:43.600> plane<00:01:43.840> with

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
yeah we have the tail plane with

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.100 
yeah we have the tail plane with
elevator<00:01:45.580> now<00:01:46.330> it's<00:01:46.450> got<00:01:46.540> this<00:01:46.630> lovely<00:01:46.780> tough

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
elevator now it's got this lovely tough

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.260 
elevator now it's got this lovely tough
long<00:01:47.290> coating<00:01:47.740> with<00:01:47.979> all<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.220> lines<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:49.120> makes

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
long coating with all the lines it makes

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.830 
long coating with all the lines it makes
it<00:01:49.360> look<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.630> real<00:01:49.900> airplane<00:01:51.150> we<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.360> the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
it look like a real airplane we have the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.880 
it look like a real airplane we have the
fuselage<00:01:53.700> which<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.940> quite<00:01:55.840> really<00:01:56.500> almost

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
fuselage which is quite really almost

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.830 
fuselage which is quite really almost
complete<00:01:57.550> there's<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.120> hatch<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:58.330> goes<00:01:58.690> on

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
complete there's a hatch that goes on

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.450 
complete there's a hatch that goes on
the<00:01:58.930> back<00:01:59.080> here<00:01:59.290> we<00:01:59.530> have<00:01:59.860> to<00:01:59.950> drill<00:02:00.130> holes<00:02:00.310> and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
the back here we have to drill holes and

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.430 
the back here we have to drill holes and
screw<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.880> on<00:02:00.940> there's<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.780> canopy<00:02:02.110> on<00:02:02.290> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
screw that on there's a canopy on the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.080 
screw that on there's a canopy on the
front<00:02:02.680> which<00:02:02.860> we<00:02:03.010> can<00:02:03.130> put<00:02:03.250> some<00:02:03.490> pilots<00:02:03.940> in

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
front which we can put some pilots in

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.320 
front which we can put some pilots in
and<00:02:04.740> inside<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:06.250> rest<00:02:06.400> of<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:06.790> all<00:02:06.940> laser

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
and inside the rest of it it's all laser

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.089 
and inside the rest of it it's all laser
cut<00:02:07.659> plywood<00:02:07.930> quite<00:02:08.649> good<00:02:08.860> quality

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
cut plywood quite good quality

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.830 
cut plywood quite good quality
construction<00:02:09.849> that's<00:02:09.970> plenty<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.239> glue<00:02:10.420> and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
construction that's plenty of glue and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.010 
construction that's plenty of glue and
it's<00:02:11.379> quite<00:02:11.590> light<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.580> because<00:02:13.510> all<00:02:13.720> this

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
it's quite light and because all this

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.600 
it's quite light and because all this
space<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.560> here<00:02:14.890> where<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:15.069> could<00:02:15.160> put<00:02:15.340> stuff

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
space in here where we could put stuff

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.140 
space in here where we could put stuff
now

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
now

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.400 
now
I'm<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.720> put<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> lot<00:02:17.050> of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
I'm going to put a lot of

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.810 
I'm going to put a lot of
fuel<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.010> here<00:02:18.190> around<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.550> center<00:02:18.760> of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
fuel and here around the center of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.060 
fuel and here around the center of
gravity<00:02:19.030> area<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:20.320> I'm<00:02:20.440> also<00:02:20.560> gonna<00:02:20.710> try<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
gravity area but I'm also gonna try and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.410 
gravity area but I'm also gonna try and
get<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.340> radio<00:02:21.580> gears<00:02:21.850> far<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.270> front

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
get all the radio gears far up the front

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.510 
get all the radio gears far up the front
does<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.840> get<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.500> one<00:02:24.340> thing<00:02:24.460> to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
does that I can get it and one thing to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.890 
does that I can get it and one thing to
note<00:02:24.760> though<00:02:24.910> were<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.120> thing<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.480> look

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
note though were the thing is that look

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.380 
note though were the thing is that look
how<00:02:26.110> much<00:02:26.290> frontal<00:02:26.860> area<00:02:27.220> there<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:27.910> this

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
how much frontal area there is on this

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.720 
how much frontal area there is on this
plane<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:29.320> it's<00:02:29.680> got<00:02:29.800> these<00:02:29.920> fake<00:02:30.280> ear

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
plane because it's got these fake ear

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.150 
plane because it's got these fake ear
intakes<00:02:31.180> here<00:02:31.390> there's<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:32.050> lot<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.380> drag<00:02:32.680> that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
intakes here there's a lot of drag that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.350 
intakes here there's a lot of drag that
means<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.460> even<00:02:33.610> when<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:33.910> put<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.060> really

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
means that even when we put a really

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.730 
means that even when we put a really
powerful<00:02:34.480> pulse<00:02:34.840> jet<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.260> on<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.620> thing

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
powerful pulse jet this on this thing

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.590 
powerful pulse jet this on this thing
it's<00:02:36.040> not<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.790> go<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.090> fast<00:02:37.300> which

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
it's not really gonna go that fast which

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.360 
it's not really gonna go that fast which
is<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.750> good<00:02:37.930> thing<00:02:37.960> because<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.920> what<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
is a good thing because this is what I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.220 
is a good thing because this is what I
want<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.580> see<00:02:39.700> as<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:39.970> pulse<00:02:40.630> jet<00:02:40.810> trainer<00:02:41.110> a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
want to see as a pulse jet trainer a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.050 
want to see as a pulse jet trainer a
first<00:02:41.500> pulse<00:02:41.800> trip<00:02:41.980> model<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.340> won't<00:02:42.880> have

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
first pulse trip model that won't have

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.370 
first pulse trip model that won't have
you're<00:02:43.240> sweating<00:02:43.630> your<00:02:43.780> socks<00:02:43.990> because<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
you're sweating your socks because the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.360 
you're sweating your socks because the
damn<00:02:44.530> things<00:02:44.740> so<00:02:44.890> fast

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
damn things so fast

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.280 
damn things so fast
I<00:02:45.490> still<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.240> an<00:02:46.330> impressive<00:02:46.630> rate<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.050> climb

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
I still have an impressive rate of climb

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.110 
I still have an impressive rate of climb
but<00:02:47.560> hopefully<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.430> will<00:02:48.550> be<00:02:48.700> fairly<00:02:48.940> limited

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
but hopefully it will be fairly limited

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.450 
but hopefully it will be fairly limited
in<00:02:49.480> speed<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.110> you've<00:02:50.260> got<00:02:50.350> time<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> react<00:02:51.190> to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
in speed so you've got time to react to

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.130 
in speed so you've got time to react to
the<00:02:51.910> inevitable<00:02:52.390> things<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.930> do

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
the inevitable things you have to do

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.960 
the inevitable things you have to do
yeah<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:54.160> else<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.610> box

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
yeah what else is in the box

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.270 
yeah what else is in the box
well<00:02:55.120> there's<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.810> cow<00:02:56.110> like<00:02:56.650> there's<00:02:56.860> two<00:02:57.040> cows

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
well there's a cow like there's two cows

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.610 
well there's a cow like there's two cows
one<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.300> them<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> clear<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:58.960> like<00:02:59.440> this

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
one of them is a clear one like this

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.410 
one of them is a clear one like this
which<00:02:59.830> is<00:02:59.860> originally<00:03:00.550> designed<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.240> kit

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.110 
aerodynamics we need to make the model
look<00:03:19.780> right<00:03:20.200> now<00:03:20.830> because<00:03:21.610> other<00:03:21.850> things

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
look right now because other things

statues it's got a fuel tank which we
will<00:03:32.950> not<00:03:33.070> use<00:03:33.250> because<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.120> pitifully

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
will not use because it is so pitifully

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
bits for under carriage legs there's who

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.960 
bits for under carriage legs there's who
knows<00:03:41.560> what<00:03:41.740> something<00:03:42.040> anyway<00:03:42.280> there's<00:03:42.850> some

knows what something anyway there's some

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.720 
knows what something anyway there's some
linkages<00:03:43.330> in<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.570> bottom<00:03:43.810> there<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.730> really

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
linkages in the bottom there and really

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.290 
linkages in the bottom there and really
that's<00:03:45.850> about<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.360> Oh<00:03:46.800> can't<00:03:47.800> forget<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.760> bomb

that's about it Oh can't forget the bomb
yes<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.770> tank<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.340> comes<00:03:51.580> with<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:52.060> bomb<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:53.110> a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
yes the tank it comes with a bomb and a

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.170 
yes the tank it comes with a bomb and a
release<00:03:53.650> mechanism<00:03:53.680> well<00:03:54.610> half<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.060> one

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
release mechanism well half of one

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.970 
release mechanism well half of one
anyway<00:03:55.330> inside<00:03:56.080> so<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.320> can<00:03:56.350> fit<00:03:56.620> this<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.890> the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
anyway inside so you can fit this to the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.010 
anyway inside so you can fit this to the
bottom<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.220> your<00:03:57.310> model<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.730> drop<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.360> well

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
bottom of your model and drop it well

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.390 
bottom of your model and drop it well
using<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.410> fifth<00:03:59.650> or<00:03:59.860> sixth<00:04:00.100> channel<00:04:00.340> or

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
using the fifth or sixth channel or

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.610 
using the fifth or sixth channel or
whatever<00:04:00.520> on<00:04:00.700> your<00:04:00.820> radio<00:04:01.030> gear<00:04:01.239> I<00:04:01.620> think

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
whatever on your radio gear I think

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.600 
whatever on your radio gear I think
we're<00:04:02.709> gonna<00:04:02.830> have<00:04:02.920> enough<00:04:02.980> problems<00:04:03.340> without

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
we're gonna have enough problems without

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.550 
we're gonna have enough problems without
dropping<00:04:03.820> bombs<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.810> we<00:04:05.080> might<00:04:05.260> just<00:04:05.290> leave

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
dropping bombs so we might just leave

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.590 
dropping bombs so we might just leave
that<00:04:05.950> too<00:04:06.130> much<00:04:06.310> like<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.520> date<00:04:06.760> but<00:04:07.120> there<00:04:07.540> you

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600
