like but there's a one big kicker here
for<00:01:30.299> most<00:01:30.479> people<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.170> price<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:32.130> two

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
for most people the price it's two

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.940 
for most people the price it's two
hundred<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> fifty<00:01:33.360> dollars<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.530> me<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
hundred and fifty dollars now for me I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
hundred and fifty dollars now for me I
have<00:01:35.220> 75<00:01:35.850> dollars<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.450> gift<00:01:36.570> cards<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.960> bestbuy

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
have 75 dollars in gift cards to bestbuy

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.770 
have 75 dollars in gift cards to bestbuy
so<00:01:37.829> basically<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.759> makes<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.390> same

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so basically that makes this the same

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
so basically that makes this the same
price<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.530> flip<00:01:40.950> most<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.610> may<00:01:41.729> be

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
price as the flip most of you may be

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
price as the flip most of you may be
asking<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.420> why<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.049> world<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> need

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
asking now why in the world do you need

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
asking now why in the world do you need

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.370 
it seems like a really cool camera the
video<00:04:29.110> quality<00:04:29.380> on<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.070> playback<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:30.670> far<00:04:30.940> is

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
video quality on the playback so far is

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.810 
video quality on the playback so far is
amazing<00:04:32.380> one<00:04:33.070> thing<00:04:33.400> though<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.580> I'm

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
amazing one thing though that I'm

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.340 
amazing one thing though that I'm
noticing<00:04:34.030> is<00:04:34.390> that<00:04:34.450> when<00:04:34.690> i<00:04:34.720> move<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.110> camera

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
noticing is that when i move the camera

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.790 
noticing is that when i move the camera
around<00:04:35.550> like<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.870> can<00:04:38.050> hear<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.560> and

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
around like this you can hear it and

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.070 
around like this you can hear it and
that's<00:04:39.100> kind<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.120> little<00:04:40.420> bit<00:04:40.570> annoying<00:04:40.840> but

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
that's kind of a little bit annoying but

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.560 
that's kind of a little bit annoying but
of<00:04:41.410> course<00:04:41.680> if<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:41.890> watch<00:04:42.040> CTFxC<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:43.090> one<00:04:43.300> place

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
of course if you watch CTFxC a one place

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.180 
of course if you watch CTFxC a one place
that<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:43.810> got<00:04:43.990> this<00:04:44.110> camera<00:04:44.440> recommended<00:04:45.010> from

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
that I got this camera recommended from

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.100 
that I got this camera recommended from
would<00:04:45.670> notice<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.420> they<00:04:46.540> also<00:04:46.690> have<00:04:46.960> that

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
would notice that they also have that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.630 
would notice that they also have that
sound<00:04:47.320> effect<00:04:47.620> in<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.830> background<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.430> all

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
sound effect in the background to all

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.010 
sound effect in the background to all
right<00:04:48.790> before<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.150> shoot<00:04:49.480> it's<00:04:49.750> kind<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:49.930> a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
right before you shoot it's kind of a

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.840 
right before you shoot it's kind of a
red<00:04:50.260> light<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.710> shoots<00:04:50.950> out<00:04:51.160> it's<00:04:51.490> also<00:04:51.640> if

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
red light that shoots out it's also if

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.250 
red light that shoots out it's also if
you<00:04:51.970> press<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.240> down<00:04:52.390> I<00:04:52.540> think<00:04:52.840> for<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.020> certain

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
you press it down I think for a certain

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.390 
you press it down I think for a certain
amount<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.500> time<00:04:53.650> but<00:04:53.800> that's<00:04:53.980> kind<00:04:54.310> of

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
amount of time but that's kind of

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.650 
amount of time but that's kind of
annoying<00:04:54.640> i<00:04:54.940> don't<00:04:55.060> know<00:04:55.150> if<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.300> can<00:04:55.420> figure

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
annoying i don't know if you can figure

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.050 
annoying i don't know if you can figure
