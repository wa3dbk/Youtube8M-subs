 in the encounter that even world modes from imanol first style magazine 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.300
 of life development of symbian 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.399
 david dozens of the magazine 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.050
 part of that concept since he is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.320
 but its intake and that it finds a hole in the market quite different 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.910
 because on the one hand to the other on the negative side we have articles the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.540
 we went from space travel or who really british and must 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.390
 face important which we show that what is happening in 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.210
 the world 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.720
 diego product sales and xalapa challenge issue is there 2 at that point 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.100
 between a magazine that is and what depends 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 of fashion and temporality 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.880
 and the informative magazine we sent him with people that as commented carolina blake 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.450
 without being aware or 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.710
 of the news and want to know more people have tablets and will have tablets 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.710
 inter possible we are talking about trend we are talking about 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 technology we are talking about leisure 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.610
 repeat 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.580
 asked about the offer of 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.050
 this side of 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.160
 the distracted I will make magazines 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.030
 but the provincial seat and clarified that depending on the interactivity 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.180
 then of course because it showed part of photography to all the flavor of 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.440
 of animation 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.140
 graphic design is now between the tools used to generate 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.370
 the content 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.840
 but what has been the magazine instyle pende de adobe decides the future 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.470
 executive to defend the territory 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 people are missing many more than they should suffer 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.110
 we are not almost 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.160
 If there are seven people fixed and then we have a 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.710
 altogether for now that I'm going to be in my twenties 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.980
 really what you need more percent hides the task because in 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.870
 we do not want only to be in the magazine whose very nice platform and 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.170
 spectacular 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.090
 per cent indeed in the part is behind the word the filtrate 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.960
 information, the elaboration of information and there where it is necessary that 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.189
 they are truthful journalist hand not necessarily provided but yes people 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.939
 read each of the central themes for people 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.659
 I came for fashion people for car people we have people who really know 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.569
 car waits for it to come that really delays you have to know 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.999
 guide you that what the panorama already finished 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.189
 the future then fall against those people has not been easy 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.049
 and of course to give a value as important as the one that can later 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.889
 watch the movie trailer compliant from the live show of how it moves 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:34.669

 if an animal does not time here 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.229
 three years 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.909
 but for that we are the network was separate 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.909
 on the giant screens where he sentenced 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.449
 the real danger 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.199
 I'm alarmed and little details like 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.989
 in view that they do not come down behind it 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.749
 that in front of our 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.619
 integrated the reading of his important injury 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:16.979

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.389
 If the Spaniards do not work 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.389
 the flight that this platform has is that 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.939
 there is the same 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.649
 the one that the contents 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.649
 today I do not get daily 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.679
 we both have also 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.679
 jaime present that apple although the magazine this month 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.189
 the news jumped daughter 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 and from the psychic point of view to the difference not long ago 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.399
 it's more 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.619
 begins is to continue with and more 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:15.979
 In communication 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.539
 he's doing 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:18.859
 in rare book 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.849
 all of television 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.490
 and everything is complimenting 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.719
 all the same 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.509
 giving each other and in the background 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.039
 this does not come more than support 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.300
 and be there as support more 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.050
 for this one 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.430
 paesa there is no way to consume information that we have also 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.430
 seen that we equip agenda ochoa m 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.900
 we want to be condemned to those who consume the most with every day 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:45.460
 possible that goal 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.080
 fifth part of the force and sinister 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.909
 hence television 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:49.900
 does not about 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.370
 that the rest of that couple but that this is something more than people can 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.370
 read what you can consume and what 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.569
 but without any doubt 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:01.490
 vicenta 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.490
 the future of communication is new ecosystem and it is a step 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.120
 the way to 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.120
 so that people are more and better informed 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.879
