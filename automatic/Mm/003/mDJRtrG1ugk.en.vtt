00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.420
 am an expert in computer science I will 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.469
 learn today how to display 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.369
 may find that some records 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 are going to be hidden from the user for 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 a program such as windows live mail 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.039
 or outlook to check my messages 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.930
