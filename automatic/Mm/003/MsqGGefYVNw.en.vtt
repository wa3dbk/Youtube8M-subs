00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 welcome to another 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.060
 unboxing from me and indeed it is today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.120
 around the samsung ssd 840 euro 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.540
 and that is part of my new one 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 video series namely ex kemming pc picture 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.199
 or something I would do it differently 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.660
 this year in the series because of me 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.210
 show how to get the whole one how to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 Assembled to a computer 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.189
 and there is a ssd of course nowadays 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.779
 no longer indispensable 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.740
 it is samsung it is diego me 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.759
 I said in the 120 gb version 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.500
 we come to the packaging on the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.540
 front is not much 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 on the sides are always only short 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 Descriptions it is a sata 6 gb per 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.539
 second ssd below again a 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.370
 small description also nothing important 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.710
 But on the back we see 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.879
 then a little something here 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 once again the description forester 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:05.540
 view visionary performance 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.220
 faster and more developing blablabla 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.650
 performance so performance then samsung 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.159
 data migration software for you 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.009
 symbol upgrade means you build these 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.110
 SSD installed in your computer 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.150
 software and then from yours 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 your disk all the data on 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.750
 play the ssd and that makes that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 software very cool 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.079
 otherwise you always have to software it 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.560
 load from the house from the internet 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.200
 but there are not that good 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.140
 then to excel point samsung manager 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.110
 Software for is the performance 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 management that is a software with 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.119
 the her the performance of the of the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.720
 really bring ssd to the limit 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.909
 So can the optimized system so or 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.009
 the ssd so that everything is stable and running 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.200
 you have a very good performance here 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.840
 there is something else in the box included 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.190
 So what the box contains 7 mm ssd 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.050
 then 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.290
 manager software installation werritty 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.810
 and installation guide gives you on the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.690
 not really to say page 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.440
 Detailed information on the product 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.690
 there's on the samsung side then would 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.710
 I say the same paktiert that stand 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.540
 just pull out to pull on the tab 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:36.160
 and pull out the whole segment and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.350
 you can already see the ssd and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.360
 all this all the paperwork here 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.460
 the installation guide for a short time 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.450
 open what it is all in there 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.220
 that's how far it is here, but that's what I show 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.130
 that's why we do not build that then 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.510
 Here is the warranty description here 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.000
 Two cool stickers and the software 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.960
 Included is the whole thing 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.040
 to install 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.440
 then we come to the next one 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.800
 that's the ssd you can get here 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.690
 easy down with light pressure so 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.100
 not easy to emerge from now 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:25.400
 solve packaging and you can see the 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.920
 ssd the very front is very 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.640
 kept simple and at all 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.230
 samsung ssds 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.260
 we still have one 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.910
 bit that it had revised it 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.230
 simply from nothing big failed 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.310
 is here anyway 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 samsung ssds solid state drive because every 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.739
 black the black thing here because you 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.680
 Did not know the seminar is on the side 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.310
 It shows us directly where the whole 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.800
 connections are so it sata 3 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.110
 6 seconds and the sata connection on 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.150
 On the one side we see the one 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:09.080
 screw and like every ssd 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:13.250
 both are screwed here or 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.660
 here and then of course we have 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.190
 on the back still such a small one 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.769
 son 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.500
 that is that every one of them is small 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:29.240
 description here what else is in it yes 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.690
 just all these product codes 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.850
 if you top up the ssd here then 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.430
 will be automatically void the warranty so 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.600
 I recommend this to you the best 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.180
 no case to do 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.760
 because if you break something then 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.919
 Samsung is not liable for anything like that now 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.610
 so special here at sdp now 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.430
 you get them under 90 euros what 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.620
 is very good if at 120 gb 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.110
 that's the only ssd that so much 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.720
 but performance is still so cheap 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:08.330
 or cheap because you are cheap 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.250
 still does not look and let the ssd 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.230
 Just why this cheap is easy 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.490
 that some people do this in those cases 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.310
 I call these these ssd memories 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.240
 rediscover it now so at this 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.550
 procedure in which the are made 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.820
 such a small procedure is used 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.210
 is incredible where is the money really 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.700
 at 21 or 24 nanometers that's why 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.210
 the motherboard you's inside only 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.380
 not even half of the ss de 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.030
 Can you lift it up now ? 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.830
 remember this very easily 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.640
 So I saw my video from 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.560
 from jurek that the board is just so big 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.540
 is similar to the earlier models 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.610
 was that at least as big and had the 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.650
 Chips are distributed everywhere and it is now 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.500
 not the case here anymore 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.910
 and so it will be cheaper 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.450
 because you do not need so much material 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.040
 and on the other hand you can see him a whole 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.490
 Finger touch in the sweat was already doing it 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.770
 and for another , she is too 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.890
 more efficient and consumes it and 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.680
 Gives less heat off a benchmark 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.720
 may follow if I the pc 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.440
 whether assembled when the danes this 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.260
 pc picture want to see or how to get one 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.120
 usd into the calculator then you can 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.380
 here you just look here me 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.850
 I'll just link 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.530
 depending on when stop the videos 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.240
 come out if I ever link this 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.000
 s.besten just looks past the canal 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.610
 I'll stay up-to- date with that 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.500
 stood and could also subscribe me 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.180
 if you want that 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.080
 Give thumbs up thumbs down and 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.760
 maybe just on the 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.690
 on the facebook page, then already from me 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.290
 you can also find in the video 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.370
 description where you can buy the ssd 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.830
 also in the video description may 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.300
 I built by amazon shop where the 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.520
 whole yes the whole pc 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.540
 parts in it i would say that 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.950
 it was already too much again 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.450
 a lot and we see as in the next video 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.450
 until then hotline and servus
