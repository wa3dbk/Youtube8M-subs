00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello to everyone I am elÃ­as 360 and os 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.000
 I bring this new video and this time 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.340
 commented gameplay of call of duty 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 ghosts we are in ruins one of the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.330
 new maps belonging to lcd 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.610
 base station a tlc that leaves tomorrow 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 same for sale if I'm not mistaken is the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.330
 second dlc and good as I did with 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 the first dlc I bring you in scoop 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 thanks to activision invited me to go 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.630
 to the official world tour of carl call 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 of duty championship and besides I could 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.720
 be recording these same gameplays 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.699
 that you are seeing that are highlights of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.960
 several games with others 9 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 youtubers so many thanks 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.430
 activision in principle the third with the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.320
 third and the fourth tlc will pass the same 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 If everything goes well but good here you have 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 the first map of the second dlc is 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.899
 call ruins and I upload this first video 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.000
 because I think it's the most 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.190
 characteristic in my opinion at least 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.840
 this new dlc of ba station because it comes out 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.489
 the predictor who is a predictor because I 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.550
 I imagine that it will sound to all of you 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.020
 alien movies see your credits 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.940
 etcetera not now you will see it of all 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.829
 ways on this occasion I have decided 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.109
 put parts in which other 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.000
 people were wearing it instead of wearing it 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.250
 myself because when you take it what 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.780
 only you have is a look interface 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.090
 thermal so to speak 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
 a kind of extraterrestrial codes to 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.340
 the left of the right in colors 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 so reddish then I think that you 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 I would call more I was going to call you more 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.280
 Attention the fact of seeing it on the outside 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.380
 black not how it's going running from how it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.420
 makes invisible and all those little things like that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.759
 that nothing to emphasize about this 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 gameplay is played entirely with the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.750
 new repair weapon that you already know is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.880
 a hybrid weapon that is to say is both your 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 rifle as assault rifle what 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380
 differences you have when you take it with 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.789
 his rifle as good when you wear the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.530
 weapon like your rifle, which is how I wear it 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.090
 me throughout this whole game in 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 other maps you will see 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.070
 Assault rifle work as you shoot 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 many more bullets per second is worth and for 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.190
 another side, then you have a greater 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.970
 mobility if you take it as a rifle 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.550
 assault 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.679
 you have more precision to medium and far 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.300
 distance but on the other hand it also 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.190
 The number of bullets per 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.420
 second which is pretty good no 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.920
 so that there is a small balance 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.080
 because otherwise this weapon would be 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.270
 practically perfect imagine you a 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.500
 gun an assault rifle firing 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 as many weapons as an assault rifle 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.090
 it would be a little crazy that more things 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.080
 tell you about this map well then in this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.820
 map we have a 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.590
 tourist and we have two orders 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.630
 of different fields one of them would be the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.640
 predictor that right now you will see 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.670
 and on the other hand we would also have another 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.490
 good order when you get it in a few 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.410
 words is like you have power over 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.480
 the volcano and you made it enter 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.580
 eruption in fact I think it detonates a 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.590
 small a small charge and that's what 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.080
 that causes it to erupt then 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.210
 fall projectiles similar to what 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.310
 would be mortars in another in 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.730
 other maps so nothing now you're going to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.440
 see that same streak so to speak 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.050
 same field orders that of the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.700
 mortars and then you go see there is 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.370
 You will now erupting volcano 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.709
 and now you are going to see the predictor that is 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.050
 the most characteristic of this map os 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.160
 I have to comment also that today this 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.020
 you will be watching it at 7:30 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.550
 if I'm not mistaken, that is but connection 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.340
 please get up at seven thirty 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.340
 then you will see a gameplay of the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.930
 extinction of the new mayday map and the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.250
 third map that I want to upload today because 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.690
 today I want to upload three videos to this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.550
 secondary channel to compensate for the fact 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.959
 that has not uploaded videos even if 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.850
 uploaded to the main channel but good 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.090
 to talk a little I want to upload them 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.790
 as well 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.680
 one of the other three remaining maps 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.090
 that are apart from this one then already 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.310
 you know there's a remastering of 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.080
 dom of the map of where of call of duty 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.730
 modern warfare 3 I do not know if it seems good 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.319
 that raises that or you want it to rise to another 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.670
 tell me anyway in the 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.250
 comments there you are seeing how it 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.680
 It makes invisible and invisible forgiveness the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.090
 predictor and you will also have observed 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.340
 that has a kind of missile of 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.690
 missile launcher on the left shoulder if 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.879
 I do not remember badly also when it goes to 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.440
 to die then there is what has been 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.790
 the hand of the dead that is something similar to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.560
 what we also had in call of duty 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.540
 modern warfare 3 and in a few words is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.390
 what tim you mole yourself blow up 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.530
 and you get to good you were going to enough 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.780
 people ahead because it's a 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.340
 kind of that in fact now you will see that 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.019
 they are going to kill me I have also put 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.090
 a part where they kill me so much 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.250
 so you can see the interface that it is 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.959
 when you're a predictor so that 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.340
 see what happens to you when they kill you 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.620
 you with that is like one that really 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.510
 only this time does not change the 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.310
 map and you are seeing one more time how 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.289
 get one of the youtubers the 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.780
 predictor and everyone to follow him 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.070
 to see how it is even though I kill myself 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.080
 final that gives you with a kind of 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.729
 claws that you have there and you will know 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.800
 of the movies too but good 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.629
 little bit more I hope you liked it 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.919
 you already know like and favorites tell me that 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:31.659
 same in the comments what map 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.159
 you want apart from the video that you are going to 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.199
 having extinction 'there's that 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:40.379
 interface and without anything else to say it 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.379
 say goodbye 360 until next time 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.520
 in those cases
