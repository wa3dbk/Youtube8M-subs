00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
of guys in tech support

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.240 
of guys in tech support
it<00:00:32.390> doesn't<00:00:32.720> involve<00:00:32.930> marring<00:00:33.440> your<00:00:33.470> cab<00:00:33.829> or

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
doing anything like that the easiest

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.220 
doing anything like that the easiest
thing<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.829> do<00:00:37.070> is<00:00:37.340> basically<00:00:38.000> your<00:00:38.690> logo<00:00:38.899> plate

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
thing to do is basically your logo plate

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.099 
thing to do is basically your logo plate
has<00:00:39.410> four<00:00:39.680> screws<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:40.370> if<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:41.750> unscrew<00:00:42.679> one

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109

of<00:00:45.109> those<00:00:45.260> screws<00:00:45.530> just<00:00:45.949> enough<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.269> can

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
of those screws just enough so you can

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.770 
of those screws just enough so you can
get<00:00:47.539> a<00:00:47.600> pair<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:47.809> pliers<00:00:47.960> around<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:50.570> can

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
get a pair of pliers around it you can

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.119 
get a pair of pliers around it you can
take<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.320> shop<00:00:52.010> rag<00:00:52.359> put<00:00:53.359> around<00:00:53.600> your<00:00:53.780> pliers

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
take a shop rag put around your pliers

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.860 
take a shop rag put around your pliers
and<00:00:55.929> then<00:00:56.929> grip<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.379> screw<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.600> then<00:00:59.600> pull

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
and then grip that screw and then pull

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.509 
and then grip that screw and then pull
and<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.800> should<00:01:01.010> come<00:01:01.039> off<00:01:01.219> pretty

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
and then it should come off pretty

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.069 
and then it should come off pretty
easily<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.269> might<00:01:02.420> need<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.749> little<00:01:02.929> more

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
easily you might need a little more

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.220 
easily you might need a little more
force<00:01:03.469> than<00:01:03.559> that<00:01:04.180> but<00:01:05.180> then<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.870> comes<00:01:06.050> right

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
force than that but then it comes right

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.850 
force than that but then it comes right
off<00:01:06.290> you'll<00:01:07.280> notice<00:01:08.350> there's<00:01:09.350> these<00:01:09.620> little

it off with the screws so if you do have

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.360 
it off with the screws so if you do have
to<00:01:59.750> do<00:01:59.900> it<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.170> way<00:02:00.350> if<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.860> feel<00:02:01.220> that

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
you're going to pull those screws out

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.420 
you're going to pull those screws out
strip<00:02:02.960> them<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.320> that's<00:02:03.920> kind<00:02:04.190> of<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.340> only

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
strip them and that's kind of the only

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.490 
strip them and that's kind of the only
way<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.700> do<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:04.910> you<00:02:05.120> want<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.330> get<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.510> obviously

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
way to do it you want to get a obviously

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.669 
way to do it you want to get a obviously
a<00:02:06.590> bigger<00:02:06.830> screwdriver<00:02:07.370> than<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.750> you

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
a bigger screwdriver than this but you

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.800 
a bigger screwdriver than this but you
might<00:02:09.979> want<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.519> try<00:02:10.729> taking<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.300> shop<00:02:11.540> rag
