00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
develops into a collaborative painting

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
develops into a collaborative painting
and<00:00:23.039> drawing<00:00:23.189> practice<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:24.090> call<00:00:24.390> us<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and drawing practice we call us out of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.570 
and drawing practice we call us out of
spontaneous<00:00:25.350> collaboration<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.340> it's

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
spontaneous collaboration because it's

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
always important for us at the beginning

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.459 
always important for us at the beginning
of<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.670> project<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.300> discuss<00:00:36.690> obviously<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
of a project to discuss obviously the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.260 
of a project to discuss obviously the
direction<00:00:37.800> we're<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.000> both<00:00:39.210> go

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
direction we're going in then we both go

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.350 
direction we're going in then we both go
away<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.559> our<00:00:40.590> own<00:00:40.710> visual<00:00:41.190> research<00:00:41.550> come

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360

back<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.230> start<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> drawings

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
back and then just start the drawings

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
back and then just start the drawings
they'll<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.700> very<00:00:44.940> much<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.870> bit

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
they'll be very much like I do a bit

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.690 
they'll be very much like I do a bit
Louise's<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> bit<00:00:46.860> we're<00:00:47.010> passing<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.430> between

Louise's a bit we're passing it between

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
Louise's a bit we're passing it between
us<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.360> quite<00:00:48.660> natural<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.110> us<00:00:49.260> now<00:00:49.469> because

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
us it's quite natural for us now because

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.680 
us it's quite natural for us now because
we've<00:00:50.039> been<00:00:50.280> working<00:00:50.820> together<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.660> long

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
we've been working together for so long

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.770 
we've been working together for so long
that<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> flow<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> working

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that there is a flow to a working

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
that there is a flow to a working
process<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:58.800> both<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.160> our<00:00:59.250> dads<00:00:59.460> were

process but both of our dads were
scientists<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.480> we've<00:01:01.050> always<00:01:01.260> had<00:01:01.440> this

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
scientists and we've always had this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.520 
scientists and we've always had this
love<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.730> New<00:01:03.090> Scientist<00:01:03.690> aesthetic<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
love of a New Scientist aesthetic or a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
love of a New Scientist aesthetic or a
biologically<00:01:05.220> microscopic<00:01:06.119> imagery<00:01:06.570> we're

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
biologically microscopic imagery we're

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.149 
biologically microscopic imagery we're
always<00:01:06.869> using<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.650> our<00:01:07.710> paintings

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
always using that for our paintings

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
always using that for our paintings
discovery<00:01:09.000> an<00:01:09.090> exploration<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.720> something
