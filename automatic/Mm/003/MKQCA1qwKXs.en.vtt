00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
spread this spread the red and you can

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.940 
spread this spread the red and you can
actually<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.390> squeeze<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.829> was

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
actually just squeeze it like I was

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
actually just squeeze it like I was
saying<00:00:38.129> before<00:00:38.250> into<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.120> thin<00:00:39.239> lines<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
saying before into really thin lines and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
saying before into really thin lines and
if<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> line<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.399> leave

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
if you like the line you can just leave

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.040 
if you like the line you can just leave
it<00:00:42.020> because<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:45.450> height<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
it because it the the height of the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.500 
it because it the the height of the
paint<00:00:46.289> also<00:00:46.590> gives<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> texture<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.360> keep

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
paint also gives it texture so just keep

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.940 
paint also gives it texture so just keep
that<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> mind<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.230> might<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.590> leave<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that in mind I might actually leave that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.939 
that in mind I might actually leave that
red<00:00:50.610> line<00:00:50.850> there<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:52.230> spread<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.680> red

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
red line there and just spread this red

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
red line there and just spread this red
over<00:00:53.219> top<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> black<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.329> it's
