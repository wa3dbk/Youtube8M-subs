00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
world that we've found that you do not

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.369 
world that we've found that you do not
need<00:00:45.039> to<00:00:45.250> use<00:00:45.429> adhesion<00:00:45.969> promoter<00:00:46.480> with<00:00:46.719> so

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
need to use adhesion promoter with so

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.099 
need to use adhesion promoter with so
the<00:00:47.469> only<00:00:47.649> thing<00:00:48.010> is<00:00:48.249> the<00:00:49.149> vinyl<00:00:49.420> fabric<00:00:49.690> spray

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
the only thing is the vinyl fabric spray

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.979 
the only thing is the vinyl fabric spray
tip<00:00:50.320> by<00:00:50.469> dupli-color<00:00:50.769> now<00:00:51.839> we're<00:00:52.839> gonna

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
tip by dupli-color now we're gonna

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.779 
tip by dupli-color now we're gonna
pretend<00:00:53.140> that<00:00:53.589> we're<00:00:53.739> not<00:00:54.039> using<00:00:54.370> vinyl

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
pretend that we're not using vinyl

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.930 
pretend that we're not using vinyl
fabric<00:00:54.999> spray<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:56.140> talk<00:00:56.379> about<00:00:56.620> this<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.879> the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
fabric spray to talk about this but the

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.729 
fabric spray to talk about this but the
times<00:00:58.329> are<00:00:58.570> all<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.839> same<00:00:59.079> you<00:00:59.320> just<00:00:59.379> don't

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
times are all the same you just don't

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.200 
times are all the same you just don't
have<00:00:59.949> to<00:01:00.219> do<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.519> first<00:01:00.699> step<00:01:00.879> which<00:01:01.179> is

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
have to do the first step which is

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.259 
have to do the first step which is
adhesion<00:01:01.899> promoter<00:01:02.230> okay<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:02.949> so<00:01:03.609> these<00:01:03.969> two

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
adhesion promoter okay and so these two

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.540 
adhesion promoter okay and so these two
are<00:01:04.449> gonna<00:01:05.080> be<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.590> exact<00:01:05.890> same<00:01:05.920> times<00:01:06.370> as

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
are gonna be the exact same times as

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.100 
are gonna be the exact same times as
everything<00:01:06.880> else<00:01:07.030> I'm<00:01:07.630> gonna<00:01:07.810> place<00:01:07.960> those

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
about I'm just gonna use Crowell

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:13.980 
about I'm just gonna use Crowell
infusion<00:01:13.210> because<00:01:13.360> we<00:01:13.479> have<00:01:13.630> this<00:01:13.780> sitting

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
use adhesion promoter okay you're gonna

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.590 
use adhesion promoter okay you're gonna
prep<00:01:29.680> your<00:01:29.829> controller<00:01:30.130> do<00:01:30.340> everything<00:01:30.790> this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
controller you're gonna spray two to

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.550 
controller you're gonna spray two to
three<00:01:35.890> light<00:01:36.219> coats<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.969> this<00:01:37.170> waiting<00:01:38.170> about

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
three light coats of this waiting about

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.130 
three light coats of this waiting about
three<00:01:39.070> minutes<00:01:39.310> in<00:01:39.700> between<00:01:39.880> each<00:01:40.270> coat<00:01:40.570> okay

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
three minutes in between each coat okay

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.149 
three minutes in between each coat okay
adhesion<00:01:41.860> promoter<00:01:42.340> two<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.360> three<00:01:43.600> coats

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
adhesion promoter two to three coats

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.889 
adhesion promoter two to three coats
three<00:01:45.159> minutes<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.610> between<00:01:45.880> each<00:01:46.000> coat<00:01:46.270> it

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
three minutes in between each coat it

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.599 
three minutes in between each coat it
doesn't<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.619> be<00:01:47.710> exactly<00:01:48.159> three<00:01:48.490> minutes

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
doesn't have to be exactly three minutes

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.849 
doesn't have to be exactly three minutes
so<00:01:49.299> don't<00:01:49.780> send<00:01:50.020> me<00:01:50.109> a<00:01:50.140> bunch<00:01:50.259> of<00:01:50.320> emails<00:01:50.560> about

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859

so don't send me a bunch of emails about
that<00:01:51.070> if<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.240> wait<00:01:52.420> five<00:01:52.689> minutes<00:01:52.869> you're

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
that if you wait five minutes you're

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.319 
that if you wait five minutes you're
gonna<00:01:53.229> be<00:01:53.350> okay<00:01:53.799> though<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.579> most<00:01:54.820> important

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
gonna be okay though the most important

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.880 
gonna be okay though the most important
part<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:55.990> do<00:01:56.229> not<00:01:56.380> want<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.740> wait

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
part is that you do not want to wait

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.209 
part is that you do not want to wait
more<00:01:57.130> than<00:01:57.340> ten<00:01:57.700> minutes<00:01:58.439> before<00:01:59.439> you<00:01:59.890> spray

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
more than ten minutes before you spray

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.440 
more than ten minutes before you spray
your<00:02:00.399> first<00:02:00.670> coat<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:00.969> color

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
your first coat of color

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.889 
your first coat of color
alright<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.280> with<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.119> usually<00:02:04.630> shoot<00:02:04.810> it

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
the game with some of them Kryolan tends

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.200 
the game with some of them Kryolan tends
to<00:06:36.390> do<00:06:36.540> that<00:06:37.070> rust-oleum<00:06:38.070> is<00:06:38.370> horrible<00:06:38.820> for<00:06:39.000> it

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.330 
to do that rust-oleum is horrible for it
Valspar<00:06:40.200> will<00:06:40.410> do<00:06:40.560> it<00:06:40.680> it's<00:06:40.830> just<00:06:40.890> cheaper

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
Valspar will do it it's just cheaper

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.610

paint<00:06:41.610> is<00:06:41.850> kind<00:06:42.120> of<00:06:42.210> sticky<00:06:42.600> but<00:06:43.260> the<00:06:43.350> clear

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
paint is kind of sticky but the clear

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.360 
paint is kind of sticky but the clear
coats<00:06:43.860> very

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
coats very

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.670 
coats very
because<00:06:44.669> it<00:06:44.790> has<00:06:44.910> no<00:06:45.150> pigment<00:06:45.389> in<00:06:45.720> it<00:06:45.840> and<00:06:46.080> so

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
because it has no pigment in it and so

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.370 
because it has no pigment in it and so
it<00:06:47.010> really<00:06:47.490> helps<00:06:47.850> to<00:06:47.910> solidify<00:06:48.510> the<00:06:48.990> paint

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
it really helps to solidify the paint

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.110 
it really helps to solidify the paint
job<00:06:49.590> so<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:49.830> protects<00:06:50.190> it<00:06:50.370> and<00:06:50.490> it<00:06:50.790> makes<00:06:50.970> it

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
job so it protects it and it makes it

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.750 
job so it protects it and it makes it
harder<00:06:51.510> cover<00:06:51.810> so<00:06:52.470> you<00:06:52.500> should<00:06:52.919> get<00:06:53.340> less<00:06:53.550> of

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
harder cover so you should get less of

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.010 
harder cover so you should get less of
the<00:06:54.530> the<00:06:55.729> tacky<00:06:56.729> feel<00:06:57.150> I<00:06:57.180> guess<00:06:57.510> with<00:06:57.720> a<00:06:57.750> clear

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020
