00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it the first time at something that's a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.700 
it the first time at something that's a
good<00:02:23.310> example<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:25.360> those<00:02:25.450> who<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.590> know

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
good example for those who you know

good example for those who you know
planning<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.160> about<00:02:27.760> trying<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.480> better

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
planning on about trying to get better

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.940 
planning on about trying to get better
at<00:02:29.020> drawing<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.560> don't<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:29.920> something

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
at drawing if you don't like something

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.400 
at drawing if you don't like something
redo<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.850> put<00:02:31.270> more<00:02:31.450> time<00:02:31.720> into<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.020> it'll<00:02:32.230> look

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
redo it put more time into it it'll look

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.050 
redo it put more time into it it'll look
better<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.130> now<00:02:33.280> I'm<00:02:33.370> constructing<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:34.030> a

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
saving it so that was two hours of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.820 
saving it so that was two hours of
drawing<00:03:03.940> last<00:03:04.180> thoughts<00:03:04.930> doing<00:03:05.620> Matt's

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
drawing last thoughts doing Matt's

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.229 
drawing last thoughts doing Matt's
actually<00:03:06.070> gave<00:03:06.459> me<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.640> opportunity<00:03:06.760> to

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
actually gave me the opportunity to

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.120 
actually gave me the opportunity to
restart<00:03:07.690> because<00:03:08.050> if<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.530> hadn't<00:03:08.830> done<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:08.980> I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
restart because if I hadn't done that I

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.650 
restart because if I hadn't done that I
wouldn't<00:03:09.459> have<00:03:09.550> read<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> whole<00:03:10.360> thing<00:03:10.570> I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
wouldn't have read on the whole thing I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.840 
wouldn't have read on the whole thing I
didn't<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:10.930> enough<00:03:11.230> time<00:03:11.410> but<00:03:11.650> i<00:03:11.890> decided<00:03:12.610> to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
didn't have enough time but i decided to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.490 
didn't have enough time but i decided to
anyway<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.330> i<00:03:13.480> put<00:03:13.720> an<00:03:13.780> extra<00:03:13.959> hour<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.260> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
anyway and i put an extra hour in it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.620 
anyway and i put an extra hour in it
like<00:03:14.709> overnight<00:03:15.130> i<00:03:15.550> was<00:03:15.880> up<00:03:16.030> till<00:03:16.239> like<00:03:16.270> one

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
like overnight i was up till like one

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.540 
like overnight i was up till like one
o'clock<00:03:16.900> drawing<00:03:17.350> which<00:03:17.770> isn't<00:03:18.040> good<00:03:18.190> because

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
o'clock drawing which isn't good because

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.580 
o'clock drawing which isn't good because
i<00:03:18.940> was<00:03:19.330> really<00:03:19.510> tired<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.900> next<00:03:19.930> day<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.320> a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
i was really tired the next day but a

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.970 
i was really tired the next day but a
few<00:03:21.040> coffees<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.700> was<00:03:21.820> fine<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.800> now<00:03:23.800> I'm

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
few coffees and I was fine so now I'm

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.080 
few coffees and I was fine so now I'm
breeder<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.580> background<00:03:24.970> this<00:03:25.030> is

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
breeder in the background this is

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.729 
breeder in the background this is
actually<00:03:25.360> quite<00:03:25.450> good<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:26.140> think<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.590> did

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
actually quite good I I think I did

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.320 
actually quite good I I think I did
quite<00:03:26.950> well<00:03:27.010> hair<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.790> now<00:03:27.940> I'm<00:03:28.060> break<00:03:28.239> the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
quite well hair so now I'm break the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.520 
quite well hair so now I'm break the
stretch<00:03:28.570> in<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.750> house<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.140> is<00:03:29.290> where<00:03:29.440> they

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
stretch in the house this is where they

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.320 
stretch in the house this is where they
will<00:03:29.650> be<00:03:29.800> inside<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.550> I'm<00:03:30.610> reconstructing<00:03:31.239> it

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
will be inside so I'm reconstructing it

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.090 
will be inside so I'm reconstructing it
from<00:03:31.570> far<00:03:31.780> away<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:32.260> think<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.709> looks<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.980> lot

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
from far away I think it looks a lot

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.320 
from far away I think it looks a lot
better<00:03:33.280> like<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:33.550> because<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.000> inside<00:03:34.120> of

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
better like that because the inside of

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.360 
better like that because the inside of
the<00:03:34.480> house<00:03:34.630> isn't<00:03:34.900> much<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.680> even<00:03:36.100> know<00:03:36.220> the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
the house isn't much I even know the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.070 
the house isn't much I even know the
inside<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> house<00:03:36.940> looks<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:37.690> it's

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
inside of the house looks like so it's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.660 
inside of the house looks like so it's
probably<00:03:38.260> best<00:03:38.500> off<00:03:38.650> for<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:38.950> also<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
probably best off for that also the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.250 
probably best off for that also the
lighting<00:03:40.120> looks<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.390> lot<00:03:40.510> better<00:03:40.660> from<00:03:40.870> outside

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
lighting looks a lot better from outside

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.590 
lighting looks a lot better from outside
because<00:03:41.440> it's<00:03:41.650> quite<00:03:41.800> dim<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.430> going<00:03:43.209> for<00:03:43.390> dim

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
because it's quite dim and going for dim

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.780 
because it's quite dim and going for dim
light<00:03:43.900> with<00:03:44.080> all<00:03:44.230> with<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.680> light<00:03:45.519> from<00:03:45.640> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
light with all with the light from the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.620 
light with all with the light from the
moon<00:03:45.970> casting<00:03:46.420> from<00:03:46.570> behind<00:03:46.810> as<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.260> he

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
moon casting from behind as a he

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.320 
moon casting from behind as a he
to<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.470> well<00:03:49.400> that's<00:03:49.580> that's<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.970> halloween

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
to that well that's that's a halloween

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.450 
to that well that's that's a halloween
thing<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.660> guess<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.080> I'm<00:03:51.920> finishing<00:03:52.220> off<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
thing I guess so I'm finishing off the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.440 
thing I guess so I'm finishing off the
house<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.730> house<00:03:52.850> actually<00:03:53.030> took<00:03:53.240> me<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:53.420> very

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
house the house actually took me a very

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.090 
house the house actually took me a very
long<00:03:53.750> time<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.290> don't<00:03:54.380> really<00:03:54.770> see<00:03:55.070> the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
long time you don't really see the

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.310 
long time you don't really see the
amount<00:03:55.610> of<00:03:55.700> time<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:55.940> took<00:03:56.180> me<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.390> create<00:03:57.170> the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
amount of time it took me to create the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.020 
amount of time it took me to create the
house<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.680> there's<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.860> little<00:03:58.070> wolf<00:03:58.190> they
