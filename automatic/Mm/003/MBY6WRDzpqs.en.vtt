00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 kg is already full with us today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.919
 trains and looks good with him and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.840
 maybe already for the weekend 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.490
 alternative gives everything else as well 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.690
 said the people who has already 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 falls earlier I had my life but 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.199
 even his loki me that both 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.500
 not so far but has always been 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.019
 my job at team a script me 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.510
 you can change the atmosphere on the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.250
 Return yesterday evening describe how it is 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:44.129
 the crew on it was quiet bus was 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 quiet we entertained today and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 I hope that we have our situations 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.379
 properly understood and analyzed 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.750
 I must be allowed to be so because 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 you see that we are we can 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.019
 not just everyone beat everyone 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.150
 Family and that makes us real makes me 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.390
 sad remains as they are not so 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.400
 far that he ideas we only positive 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.640
 you still have to tell me what 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.330
 take a look in the other direction or look 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.520
 and we had to go to our better cause 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.100
 improve us and we have three again 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.530
 Gates conceded that's really annoying 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.060
 no matter which goalkeeper is there that is 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.180
 just like that maybe nova theater 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.640
 what write that it also belongs 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.939
 that no matter which one is there really 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.950
 in three gates so that's real 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.310
 been a bad game and yes 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.770
 usually something good in football 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 The next game you can all because you 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.480
 Do it well and we'll wait or 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.480
 not only expect but 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.130
 is and for a good reaction otherwise 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.380
 a few weeks ago when it came to the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.150
 return from sebastian prödl against after 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.010
 long injury talked about it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.450
 that's a bit about it too 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.369
 look like the defender 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.900
 harmonize with each other that is 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.820
 Of course , a bit far right 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.500
 could have an effect on the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.330
 future now has sebastian prödl 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.990
 played twice with jannik vestergaard 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.730
 And there were eight goals you have to 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.550
 conclude that it is not good 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.560
 works with the two 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.200
 I got so critical not be so 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.200
 looks like that's currently been so 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.900
 and fish a little more than you do 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.030
 maybe but not only at 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.830
 the two lend that, of course 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.560
 definitely yes you need some time 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.930
 one was injured and another new one arrived 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.180
 that's really you need some time 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.140
 unfortunately we do not have this time and 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.230
 they should play already and exactly 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.930
 so that gives the to that again that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.420
 too many gates and has to be better 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.560
 and we wait this better that was what 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.370
 we go to the football 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.170
 not only that forward polzin but 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.630
 play well with each other talking about just 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.940
 because how to vote like that 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.950
 as we almost always play with 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.170
 Conviction 1 2 against 1 agree in the same way 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.350
 against wolfsburg was just like yesterday 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.730
 so big was almost alone in front and 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.200
 Nevertheless, we have so many goals 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.860
 but conceded again that not only 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.060
 the two schools but also in total 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.540
 Defensive work from us was not like that 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.540
 optimal
