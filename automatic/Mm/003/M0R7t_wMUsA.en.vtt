00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.930

 it and the technique will last longer and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.780
 selling you will have no problems and but 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.809
 Today we are primarily interested in 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 light filters is a protective category 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.770
 books posted include neutral 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.780
 filters and put away 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.149
 uv you why he is filters 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 which protect against smoky style and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.650
 there are also filters 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.810
 skylight they are the coolest first they 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.810
 the most expensive secondly they are beautiful 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 roses market they are stylish trendy but to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.450
 Sorry I'm not so stylish and trendy 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.950
 today we will talk about 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.250
 UV filters I use them 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.320
 to protect these frontal elements in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.960
 In principle, I did not use them before but 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.200
 when I bought myself conan 24 millimeter 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.180
 lens for 50 thousand rubles for me it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 were all my money all the more occupied 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.150
 I still 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 I wanted to think about how his 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 protect and on the site while I was buying in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.430
 online store so there was offered 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.799
 accompanying goods and offered there 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.500
 buy here such a filter and that's what 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.720
 happened on one of the shoot unfortunately 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 it so happened that I sharply grabbed the bag 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.000
 she was not closed and a camera with 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.549
 quite a great height fell right on 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 asphalt and asphalt was to find such 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.649
 industrial type all in these stones 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.259
 some there, too, chipped and good 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.290
 filter crashed i mean no scratch 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.170
 the lens he's as good as he is completely 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.650
 did not suffer and this investment in 500 rubles 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.870
 it is fully justified itself never know 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.010
 anything that happens already happens 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.140
 there is a section about how guests at the wedding 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.480
 put some narrow in general heap 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.409
 There are problems that can spoil 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.170
 your lens 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.629
 it is his appearance again on 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.819
 optical properties that filters we 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.250
 we pay special attention that is 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.260
 ninety-nine percent of the time you 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.620
 don't need tony for there is an effect 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.819
 clean up or you don't need to choose 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.859
 skylight filter it just rules 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.450
 white balance because we shoot 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.109
 now ru format 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.450
 digital photography is just about all its advantages 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.180
 these filters are responsible for 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.310
 I think your lens is safe 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.500
 that it is better to take care of the technology 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.629
 and because maybe first you will 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.269
 sell secondly will be very disappointing 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.879
 break new lens or scratch 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.329
 glass is very unpleasant and correct 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.819
 this is already impossible so please 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.090
 think for yourself, that is, you can easily 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.549
 buy on ebay rubles for 200 for 300 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.769
 the easiest Chinese filter that is 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.650
 there is practically no difference 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.480
 now begin in the comments will begin 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.250
 experts talk about what if 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.849
 buy an expensive filter any there 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.519
 super cool firms for $ 200 will 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.349
 any difference i honestly no 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.239
 the difference is not felt starred topic 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.480
 filter and the picture is as clean 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.030
 as transparent as it is without it 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.340
 there is absolutely no difference i 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.849
 buy these filters in china that is 200 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.340
 rubles 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.540
 don't take any firm there 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.190
 totally incomprehensible i don't generally them 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.470
 I know what kind of film is this company 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.810
 but in general, what's the main thing that they 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.870
 do their job they protect 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.239
 lens from the effects of different 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.959
 mechanical damage like this 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.389
 personal experience 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.519
 again you are just my personal experience i'm not 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.780
 say he should be with you i'm talking 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.030
 that you can buy it 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.699
 to avoid such a situation 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.250
 it may be your career once 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.289
 and it will work but 200 rubles which you 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.810
 spend to save and lens 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.329
 for 50 thousand rubles it seems to me that 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.490
 worth it even if it stands there lens 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.639
 and cheaper there is an effect will give you worth 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.409
 slightly more expensive that's okay, I 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.419
 I recommend to think about what you 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.159
 maybe he will need clean 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.870
 lens we dress the filter right out 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.180
 boxes he cleaned there 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.060
 and beautiful and everything and use 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.009
 enjoy life if you are cool 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.469
 glam is take yourself a skylight 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.800
 filter it costs a bit more expensive but he 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.599
 unpretentious so yes cool here in general 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.360
 such information is chosen they are very 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.039
 just that is, it is written here 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.379
 tsiferki magic dressed inside the lens 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.539
 how many millimeters need brothers and here 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:01.169
 here let's say 77 that is here for me 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:05.280
 it turns out the filter is 72 to hit sleep 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:07.460
 q and 77 I get a millimeter by 2 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.229
 four is all very simple guys 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.360
 buy don't spare this money but again 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.539
 do you think you need it because 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.250
 on my carl zeiss and there it is very deep 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.759
 planted that frontal element a on 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.039
 necks 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.740
 it is very close to the edge of the lens 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.599
 and blend I do not like in principle blend 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.490
 good but I like the filter more 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.300
 Best regards 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.300
 attention yet
