00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
weeks before we started filming and the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.830 
weeks before we started filming and the
first<00:00:22.040> thing<00:00:22.279> I<00:00:22.400> defined<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:22.939> voice<00:00:23.119> of<00:00:23.419> the

different the Tim Monica's dialogue
coach<00:00:30.320> I<00:00:30.470> worked<00:00:30.680> with<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:30.980> he<00:00:31.130> sent<00:00:31.369> me<00:00:31.489> lots

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
coach I worked with so he sent me lots

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.799 
coach I worked with so he sent me lots
of<00:00:31.989> recordings<00:00:32.989> of<00:00:33.170> different<00:00:33.530> Louisiana<00:00:34.040> man

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
of recordings of different Louisiana man

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.780 
of recordings of different Louisiana man
accents<00:00:35.809> and<00:00:36.110> then<00:00:37.040> just<00:00:37.280> working<00:00:37.460> with<00:00:37.700> the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
accents and then just working with the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.299 
accents and then just working with the
script<00:00:38.090> closely<00:00:38.600> every<00:00:38.809> day<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.469> a<00:00:40.070> lot<00:00:40.100> of

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
script closely every day and a lot of

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:53.439 
script closely every day and a lot of
repetition<00:00:51.070> it's<00:00:52.070> also<00:00:52.190> very<00:00:52.640> eloquently

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
repetition it's also very eloquently

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.110 
repetition it's also very eloquently
written<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:55.280> not<00:00:55.429> just<00:00:55.489> sort<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:55.999> you

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
written and so it's not just sort of you

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.649 
written and so it's not just sort of you
know<00:00:57.429> laying<00:00:58.429> out<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.789> facts<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.480> time

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
know laying out the facts of the time

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.110 
know laying out the facts of the time
period<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.920> what<00:01:01.219> slavery<00:01:01.640> was<00:01:01.760> all<00:01:01.879> about

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
period and what slavery was all about

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.350 
period and what slavery was all about
it's<00:01:02.329> also<00:01:02.539> beautifully<00:01:03.079> told<00:01:03.370> so<00:01:04.370> um<00:01:04.850> when<00:01:05.330> I

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
it's also beautifully told so um when I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.940 
it's also beautifully told so um when I
got<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.690> script<00:01:05.870> which<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.409> got<00:01:06.560> before<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
got the script which I got before the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.899 
got the script which I got before the
book<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.870> just<00:01:08.870> was<00:01:09.290> very<00:01:09.470> moved<00:01:09.770> by<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.460> by<00:01:10.850> the

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
book I just was very moved by it by the

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.390 
book I just was very moved by it by the
end<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.420> script<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:12.050> pretty<00:01:12.710> tearful<00:01:13.190> and

end of the script of pretty tearful and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.270 
end of the script of pretty tearful and
I<00:01:14.150> called<00:01:14.450> up<00:01:14.659> Steve<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.799> said<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.130> him<00:01:16.189> you

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
I called up Steve and I said to him you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.100 
I called up Steve and I said to him you
know<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.430> wanted<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.729> be<00:01:16.790> part<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.329> if<00:01:17.899> it

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
know I wanted to be part of it if it

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.870 
know I wanted to be part of it if it
meant<00:01:18.290> like<00:01:18.590> one<00:01:18.799> day's<00:01:19.070> work<00:01:19.369> or<00:01:19.520> two<00:01:19.700> days

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
meant like one day's work or two days

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.389 
meant like one day's work or two days
work<00:01:20.149> I<00:01:20.420> just<00:01:21.170> wanted<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:21.770> be<00:01:21.860> part<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.280> this

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
work I just wanted to be part of this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:35.719 
work I just wanted to be part of this
story

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.490 

it<00:01:36.729> shows<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.120> complexity<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.750> slavery<00:01:38.320> and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
it shows the complexity of slavery and

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.140 
it shows the complexity of slavery and
exactly<00:01:38.950> sort<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.370> all<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.670> different<00:01:39.970> sort

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
exactly sort of all the different sort

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.359 
exactly sort of all the different sort
of<00:01:40.210> facets<00:01:40.660> of<00:01:40.840> slavery<00:01:41.590> which<00:01:42.130> perhaps

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
of facets of slavery which perhaps

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.640 
of facets of slavery which perhaps
hasn't<00:01:42.760> been<00:01:43.000> investigated<00:01:43.660> before<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.530> it's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
hasn't been investigated before so it's

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.040 
hasn't been investigated before so it's
not<00:01:44.770> just<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:45.100> black<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.490> white<00:01:45.610> scenario<00:01:46.180> it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
not just a black and white scenario it's

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.100 
not just a black and white scenario it's
a<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:48.100> shows<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.610> economy<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.240> slavery<00:01:49.690> we<00:01:49.900> see

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
a it shows the economy of slavery we see

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.460 
a it shows the economy of slavery we see
Solomon<00:01:50.470> go<00:01:50.800> from<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:52.030> logging<00:01:52.930> farm<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.440> a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
Solomon go from a logging farm to a

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.460 
Solomon go from a logging farm to a
cotton<00:01:53.920> farm<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.850> sugar<00:01:55.450> cane<00:01:55.690> so<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:56.170> see<00:01:56.380> how

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
cotton farm to sugar cane so we see how

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.140 
cotton farm to sugar cane so we see how
intrinsic<00:01:57.009> it<00:01:57.130> was<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.520> economy<00:01:57.940> of<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
intrinsic it was in the economy of the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.249 
intrinsic it was in the economy of the
south<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.660> time<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.970> see<00:02:01.270> how<00:02:02.200> it

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
south of the time and we see how it

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.499 
south of the time and we see how it
effects<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.399> oppressors<00:02:03.940> as<00:02:04.090> well<00:02:04.270> as<00:02:04.390> the

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
effects the oppressors as well as the

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.590 
effects the oppressors as well as the
oppressed<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.759> characters<00:02:06.759> like<00:02:06.940> Epps<00:02:07.180> and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
oppressed and characters like Epps and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.870 
oppressed and characters like Epps and
characters<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:08.320> Ford<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:11.280> yeah<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.489> we<00:02:12.640> see

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
characters like Ford and yeah and we see

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.180 
characters like Ford and yeah and we see
the<00:02:13.510> complexity<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.290> relationships<00:02:14.920> you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
the complexity of the relationships you

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.780 
the complexity of the relationships you
know<00:02:15.310> sixty-five<00:02:16.180> percent<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.750> think<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.110> black

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
know sixty-five percent I think of black

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.009 
know sixty-five percent I think of black
American<00:02:18.790> males<00:02:20.160> I've<00:02:21.160> got<00:02:21.519> white<00:02:22.420> blood<00:02:22.989> in

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
American males I've got white blood in

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.530 
American males I've got white blood in
them<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.370> just<00:02:24.580> shows<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.790> how<00:02:24.970> sort<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
them so that just shows you how sort of

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.009 
them so that just shows you how sort of
endemic<00:02:26.500> rape<00:02:26.980> was<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.790> know<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.660> gun<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
endemic rape was you know on the gun the

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.009 
endemic rape was you know on the gun the
plantation<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:31.360> know<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.810> we're

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
plantation and so you know that we're

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.910 
plantation and so you know that we're
all<00:02:32.170> part<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.070> each<00:02:33.220> other<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:35.019> think

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
all part of each other and so I think

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.740 
all part of each other and so I think
that's<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:36.910> kind<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.420> another

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
that's that's really kind of another
