00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
over the fall and winter here's what you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.400 
over the fall and winter here's what you
do

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
do

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
do
remove<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> nozzle<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.090> last

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
remove the nozzle from the last

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
remove the nozzle from the last
sprinkler<00:00:54.690> head<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.960> each<00:00:55.110> line<00:00:55.489> run<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
sprinkler head on each line run the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.459 
sprinkler head on each line run the
system<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.690> replace<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> nozzle<00:00:58.289> ISM

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
system and replace the nozzle ISM

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.770 
system and replace the nozzle ISM
so<00:01:00.010> about<00:01:00.430> how<00:01:00.699> long<00:01:00.940> do<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.180> run<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.449> system

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
so about how long do you run the system

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.039 
so about how long do you run the system
for<00:01:01.989> 30<00:01:02.680> seconds<00:01:03.129> should<00:01:03.250> be<00:01:03.309> fine<00:01:03.869> so<00:01:04.869> then

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
for 30 seconds should be fine so then

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.920 
for 30 seconds should be fine so then
what's<00:01:05.259> next<00:01:05.710> next<00:01:06.400> we're<00:01:07.299> going<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.540> turn<00:01:07.750> on

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
what's next next we're going to turn on

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.450 
what's next next we're going to turn on
the<00:01:08.020> sprinkler<00:01:08.350> system<00:01:08.380> it's<00:01:08.830> one<00:01:09.040> watering

looking<00:01:11.950> for<00:01:12.130> problems<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:14.080> exactly<00:01:14.590> what

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
looking for problems so exactly what

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.050 
looking for problems so exactly what
kind<00:01:14.979> of<00:01:15.040> problems<00:01:15.430> should<00:01:15.610> we<00:01:15.790> be<00:01:15.909> looking

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
kind of problems should we be looking

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.510 
kind of problems should we be looking
for<00:01:16.420> first<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.680> want<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.890> check<00:01:18.040> for<00:01:18.190> adequate

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
for first you want to check for adequate

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.670 
for first you want to check for adequate
water<00:01:18.759> pressure<00:01:19.060> our<00:01:19.869> pop-up<00:01:20.110> sprinkler<00:01:20.619> is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
water pressure our pop-up sprinkler is

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.719 
water pressure our pop-up sprinkler is
rising<00:01:21.100> all<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.310> way

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
rising all the way

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.660 
rising all the way
do<00:01:22.180> you<00:01:22.270> see<00:01:22.420> misting<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.680> why<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:23.950> pressure<00:01:24.369> so

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
do you see misting so why is pressure so

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.330 
do you see misting so why is pressure so
important<00:01:25.149> if<00:01:25.810> pressures<00:01:26.229> too<00:01:26.380> low<00:01:26.409> it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
important if pressures too low it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.130 
important if pressures too low it
reduces<00:01:27.670> sprinkler<00:01:28.030> efficiency<00:01:28.539> drastically

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
reduces sprinkler efficiency drastically

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.010 
reduces sprinkler efficiency drastically
and<00:01:29.350> increases<00:01:29.890> runoff<00:01:30.220> if<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.060> too<00:01:31.180> high<00:01:31.360> it

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
and increases runoff if it's too high it

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.080 
and increases runoff if it's too high it
can<00:01:32.229> cause<00:01:32.409> misting<00:01:32.860> which<00:01:33.490> sprays<00:01:33.820> water

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
can cause misting which sprays water

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.999 
can cause misting which sprays water
into<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.420> air<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.810> drift<00:01:35.050> away<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.500> evaporate

correct sized nozzle otherwise it
becomes<00:02:28.720> inefficient<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:30.340> how<00:02:30.489> about

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
becomes inefficient so how about

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.430 
becomes inefficient so how about

here you can remove or trim whatever's
in<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> way<00:02:36.849> you<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.900> replace<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.319> sprinkler

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
in the way you can replace the sprinkler

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.190 
in the way you can replace the sprinkler
with<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> model<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.310> pops<00:02:39.610> up<00:02:39.760> higher<00:02:40.000> or<00:02:40.569> you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
with a model that pops up higher or you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.020 
with a model that pops up higher or you
can<00:02:41.440> also<00:02:41.620> raise<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.950> head<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.489> is<00:02:42.610> too<00:02:42.790> low

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
can also raise the head that is too low

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.000 
can also raise the head that is too low
by<00:02:43.360> digging<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.810> up<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.110> replacing<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.800> riser

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010

under the head with a taller riser

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.070 
under the head with a taller riser
and<00:02:47.340> what's<00:02:48.000> your<00:02:48.150> technique<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.750> clearing

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and what's your technique for clearing

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.040 
and what's your technique for clearing
out<00:02:49.200> those<00:02:49.410> clock<00:02:49.740> sprinklers<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.810> clean

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
out those clock sprinklers you can clean

minimize clogging so let's take a second
to<00:03:00.060> recap<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.900> far<00:03:01.200> we've<00:03:01.470> flushed<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
to recap so far we've flushed the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040 
to recap so far we've flushed the
sprinkler<00:03:02.430> system<00:03:02.460> we've<00:03:03.450> turned<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
sprinkler system we've turned on the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.840 
sprinkler system we've turned on the
sprinklers<00:03:04.110> one<00:03:04.830> watering<00:03:05.250> zone<00:03:05.430> at<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.640> time

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.940 
sprinklers one watering zone at a time
and<00:03:06.240> then<00:03:06.660> we've<00:03:06.810> walked<00:03:07.050> each<00:03:07.350> zone<00:03:07.620> looking

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and then we've walked each zone looking

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.690 
and then we've walked each zone looking
for<00:03:08.160> problems

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
for problems

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.210 
for problems
lastly<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.810> made<00:03:10.050> repairs<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.650> adjustments

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
