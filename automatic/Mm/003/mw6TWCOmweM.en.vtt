00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 if they respect us it's because we do not 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.799
 we won it on the court 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.520
 doing things well and getting 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.730
 you what the institution requires the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.710
 statistics are left aside believe me 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.820
 although we had a streak 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.730
 positive before cougars and that was 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.200
 side because today if you tell me that you 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.270
 hand is going through a good time 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.010
 is the reality we can not 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.620
 relax, I'll repeat it again and 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.930
 we are all aware of these 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.760
 parties to be called classics at 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 have that rivalry you can not trust 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.059
 in the statistics that give a side 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.010
 and as the party demands, we have 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.720
 to prepare for these weeks now 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 knowing what 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.160
 that the party is going to be very 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.470
 complicated and that we have to play with 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.290
 all the seriousness of the world to pumas us 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.200
 become more dangerous ourselves 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 thank goodness is going to be dangerous if we 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.909
 we relax more will be your job 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.750
 how they want to do it 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.540
 all the equipment 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.760
 they prepare to win week after 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.980
 week and today they do not make the exception for 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.290
 what the party of the 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.690
 dangerous are ourselves in 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.700
 question of not relaxing and I think not 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.110
 I am confident that the team does not 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.510
 is going to relax because we are very 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.240
 aware of the importance of this 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.710
 party and good and how do I return it to 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.720
 repeat is the very big commitment 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.840
 within the group to continue for this 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.130
 way and do things the same 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.960
 way like more mature floods 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.310
 I think that the maturity that the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.460
 team 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.880
 I think it has been very important and good 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.009
 everything as I tell you is enclosed is given to 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.080
 root of getting that title I think that 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.510
 we are all in a confidence at the top 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.850
 are at a great level the reality is 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.680
 that everyone is at a great level and how 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.600
 I tell you I think that all that is taken for 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.940
 because things are not happening 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.680
 most important of all is that what 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.990
 we talk to each other and we say no 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.110
 we can 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.420
 put the caps I think what we have 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.370
 done until now there is much more more 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.140
 trust for what's coming and that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.470
 we have to work very very hard and 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.240
 I think that everyone already has the team that we had 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.840
 the last tournament and those who have arrived 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.400
 they have realized that we can 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.890
 all with a great commitment we can 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.660
 follow this through this step very motivated 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.240
 I think all this step is all this 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.190
 moment gives you a lot of motivation gives you 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.290
 very confident and good enjoying the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.750
 moment but being aware that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.570
 The milestone is a great commitment 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.250
 we are taking we should not go down to 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.740
 Otherwise keep working very hard 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.900
 that what is coming is doubly more 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.900
 strong to stop to try
