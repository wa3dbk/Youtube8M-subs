is pretty straightforward one thing

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.400

if they end up in the graveyard great

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.409 
if they end up in the graveyard great
because<00:05:06.020> then<00:05:06.250> your<00:05:07.250> who<00:05:07.580> cake<00:05:07.820> can<00:05:08.030> just<00:05:08.240> like

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
because then your who cake can just like

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.409 
because then your who cake can just like
go<00:05:09.080> off<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:10.280> becomes<00:05:10.580> more<00:05:10.820> alive<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.270> your

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
go off and it becomes more alive so your

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.540 
go off and it becomes more alive so your
opponent<00:05:11.750> tries<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.100> activate<00:05:13.100> some<00:05:13.250> effect
