possible or the shortest length are not
sure<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.690> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.870> go<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.710> and

harm no foul is still run it came out at
17<00:03:32.790> miles<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.390> changed<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.110> codes<00:03:34.410> at<00:03:34.770> 19<00:03:35.490> to

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
17 miles I changed the codes at 19 to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.290 
17 miles I changed the codes at 19 to
shut<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.030> MAL<00:03:36.510> off<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.070> that's<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.250> 250<00:03:39.120> miles

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
shut the MAL off and that's it 250 miles

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.440 
shut the MAL off and that's it 250 miles
later<00:03:39.600> no<00:03:40.290> code<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.250> confident<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.240> it's

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
later no code so I confident that it's

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.540 
later no code so I confident that it's
cleared<00:03:42.780> but<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.080> will<00:03:43.440> switch<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:43.860> if<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.310> need

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
cleared but I will switch it if I need

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.520

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
to clear the PIO for 20 code but what I

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.350 
to clear the PIO for 20 code but what I
had<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.350> do<00:04:13.500> here<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.010> drill<00:04:14.610> out<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:15.000> set<00:04:15.209> the

you<00:04:18.639> know<00:04:18.819> my<00:04:19.479> drill<00:04:19.840> bit<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.409> drill<00:04:20.560> did

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
you know my drill bit and the drill did

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.050 
you know my drill bit and the drill did
not<00:04:21.639> fit<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:23.169> had<00:04:23.409> to<00:04:23.530> use<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.400> plain<00:04:24.759> old

file a rat's tail and it took me about

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.320 
file a rat's tail and it took me about
two<00:04:28.629> hours<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.409> get<00:04:30.009> the<00:04:30.190> hole<00:04:30.340> outs<00:04:30.580> aluminum

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
two hours to get the hole outs aluminum

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.309 
two hours to get the hole outs aluminum
took<00:04:31.690> my<00:04:31.870> time<00:04:32.169> put<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.159> piece<00:04:33.370> on<00:04:34.110> cleared<00:04:35.110> my
