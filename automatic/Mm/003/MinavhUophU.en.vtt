00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:04.589
 Sunday afternoon and no one to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.700
 chatter 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:13.650
 nothing in the bald this power saw 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.099
 Lots of drinks and much more in the fridge 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 fewer 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.250
 then you go there where all the shops 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.369
 are open 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.859
 where life meets the hottest place 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.510
 The city is also known as the train station 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.269
 There are 5400 institutions of this kind 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.840
 in Germany some big and glamorous 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 others small and cuddly and the best 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.360
 From here trains go to the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 most beautiful places in the world 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 Just relax 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.629
 surprise or look at you 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.070
 the numerous passengers 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.440
 Informational announcements already have the goal 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 betrayed in advance 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.219
 but you can also just 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.980
 let it drift and a few of the 2300 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.620
 kilometers of platform walk or on 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.570
 shopping a million square feet 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.579
 for a helgolander that's as much as 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.280
 its complete habitat though 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.640
 try helgoland after 21 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 Do not go shopping at all 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.920
 different in many major stations themselves 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 If you are late hour 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.100
 sweaty swarmed because of them 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.500
 it has come to mind that they are still livery 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.180
 an engagement ring or shades of gray 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.780
 do not need a problem 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 Arrive on a shopping trip 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.439
 three billion people a year 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.710
 of course, the size of the farms 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.140
 The World's Contact Exchange also at the train station 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.060
 of course, does not always work but for 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.180
 There is always good luck 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.720
 because every day holds 400,000 trains 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.740
 on a platform of the german railway 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.259
 but what if I'm not like that anymore 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.530
 attractive and vigorous when 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.390
 from my eagle eyes chicken eyes 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.170
 How do I get on then? 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 station clear 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.909
 I'll show you for her 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.110
 age a bit nicely with weights 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.780
 first the glasses and earplugs 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.870
 so that it is authentic and with 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.629
 limited freedom of movement 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.090
 if every staircase becomes one 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.230
 you are still grateful to the railways for 2000 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.910
 elevators but modernization and 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.360
 Of course, maintenance has its own 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.819
 price 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.980
 in this case, 800 million euro per 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.550
 year 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.709
 nothing comes of nothing if you want now 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.590
 understand only station I 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.180
 done everything right so dear friends 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.280
 and now i'll show you how to get in 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.280
 feels young and fit again for five seconds 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.319
 just drop the old ballast 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.850
 yes, as soon as you have a bit of fun here 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 yes, the life and next time 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:12.190
 Show them Benny that the train is more 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.190
 as the sum of your trains where you are
