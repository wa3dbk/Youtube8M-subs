471<00:01:53.090> 0<00:01:53.330> HQ<00:01:54.160> clocked<00:01:55.160> out<00:01:55.280> 2.5<00:01:55.850> gigahertz<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.570> I

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
471 0 HQ clocked out 2.5 gigahertz and I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.630 
471 0 HQ clocked out 2.5 gigahertz and I
think<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.050> almost<00:01:57.289> walks<00:01:57.619> up<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.860> 3.5

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
think it almost walks up to 3.5

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.060 
think it almost walks up to 3.5
gigahertz<00:01:59.000> or<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.539> also<00:02:00.020> comes<00:02:00.259> with<00:02:00.410> 16<00:02:00.830> gigs

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
gigahertz or so also comes with 16 gigs

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.359 
gigahertz or so also comes with 16 gigs
of<00:02:01.220> ddr3<00:02:01.759> memory<00:02:02.360> also<00:02:03.229> one<00:02:03.560> terabyte<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.190> hard

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
of ddr3 memory also one terabyte of hard

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.440 
of ddr3 memory also one terabyte of hard

see my videos in 4k alright as far as
performance<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.090> thing<00:03:14.270> is

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
performance this thing is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.539 
performance this thing is
beast<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:15.260> thing<00:03:15.409> comes<00:03:15.620> with<00:03:15.799> an<00:03:15.950> nvidia

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
beast this thing comes with an nvidia

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.470 
beast this thing comes with an nvidia
gtx<00:03:17.470> 970m<00:03:18.470> which<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.610> one<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.909> top<00:03:20.180> line<00:03:20.450> I

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
gtx 970m which is one of the top line I

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.110 
gtx 970m which is one of the top line I
think<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.049> one<00:03:21.260> above<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.769> is<00:03:21.950> 980m<00:03:22.489> now<00:03:22.939> by

think the one above that is 980m now by

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.460 
think the one above that is 980m now by

the time you see this video there might

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.020 
the time you see this video there might
be<00:03:24.500> better<00:03:24.950> video<00:03:25.400> course<00:03:25.670> we'll<00:03:25.879> definitely

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
be better video course we'll definitely

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.330 
be better video course we'll definitely
check<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.510> out<00:03:26.720> before<00:03:27.170> you<00:03:27.200> buy<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.560> laptop<00:03:27.860> R

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
check it out before you buy the laptop R

as far as playing video games in 4k I
probably<00:03:31.280> wouldn't<00:03:31.640> recommend<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.269> but<00:03:32.420> if

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
probably wouldn't recommend it but if

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.600 
probably wouldn't recommend it but if
you're<00:03:32.659> playing<00:03:32.900> video<00:03:33.290> games<00:03:33.530> in<00:03:33.769> 2k<00:03:34.370> or

I mainly got this for video editing as

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.280 
I mainly got this for video editing as
far<00:03:40.760> as<00:03:40.879> gaming<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.540> should<00:03:41.720> be<00:03:41.840> fairly<00:03:42.140> good

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290

we'll<00:03:42.799> do<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.920> benchmark<00:03:43.190> test<00:03:43.549> here<00:03:43.730> in<00:03:43.849> bit

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
we'll do a benchmark test here in bit

like four point two pounds of 4k editing
right<00:03:59.359> here<00:03:59.720> in<00:04:00.109> one<00:04:00.440> laptop<00:04:00.889> now<00:04:01.280> as<00:04:01.400> far<00:04:01.579> as

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
right here in one laptop now as far as

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.930 
right here in one laptop now as far as
some<00:04:01.849> of<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.000> stuff<00:04:02.389> I<00:04:02.599> don't<00:04:02.659> like<00:04:03.109> about<00:04:03.530> it

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
some of the stuff I don't like about it

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.460 
some of the stuff I don't like about it
because<00:04:04.940> it's<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.180> 4k<00:04:05.569> resolution<00:04:06.170> you

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
because it's a 4k resolution you

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.259 
because it's a 4k resolution you
actually<00:04:06.709> actually<00:04:06.829> ramped<00:04:07.280> up<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.700> text<00:04:08.120> by

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
actually actually ramped up the text by

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.530 
actually actually ramped up the text by
250%<00:04:09.200> no<00:04:09.799> software<00:04:10.310> will<00:04:10.489> look<00:04:10.700> good<00:04:10.970> but<00:04:11.030> some

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
250% no software will look good but some

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.809 
250% no software will look good but some
apps<00:04:11.810> will<00:04:12.049> look<00:04:12.290> microscopic<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:13.459> just<00:04:13.670> be

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
apps will look microscopic so just be

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.339 
apps will look microscopic so just be
aware<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.180> that<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.659> also<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:14.989> can<00:04:15.139> always

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
aware of that and also you can always

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.159 
aware of that and also you can always
switch<00:04:15.620> back<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.950> 1080p<00:04:16.630> just<00:04:17.630> for<00:04:17.810> those<00:04:17.930> apps

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
switch back to 1080p just for those apps

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.779 
switch back to 1080p just for those apps
as<00:04:18.620> far<00:04:18.859> as<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:18.979> speakers<00:04:19.370> go<00:04:19.549> they're<00:04:19.760> not

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
as far as the speakers go they're not
