not<00:06:44.720> the<00:06:45.139> out<00:06:45.289> that's<00:06:45.979> why<00:06:46.160> we<00:06:46.370> did<00:06:46.639> the<00:06:46.820> input

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
not the out that's why we did the input

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.120 
not the out that's why we did the input
on<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.750> first<00:06:47.990> shot<00:06:48.139> and<00:06:48.440> did<00:06:48.590> the<00:06:48.680> output<00:06:49.039> on

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
on the first shot and did the output on

do<00:06:58.669> because<00:06:59.120> if<00:06:59.449> you<00:06:59.570> don't<00:06:59.690> it's<00:06:59.900> probably

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
do because if you don't it's probably

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.170 
do because if you don't it's probably
not<00:07:00.349> going<00:07:00.470> to<00:07:00.530> work<00:07:00.740> is<00:07:01.280> it<00:07:01.490> go<00:07:01.580> to<00:07:01.639> configure

set it to quadraphonic that lets you
