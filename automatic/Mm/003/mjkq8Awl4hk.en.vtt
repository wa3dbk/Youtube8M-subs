00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
something this episode and I really

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
something this episode and I really

entire<00:00:56.730> scary<00:00:57.239> freaking<00:00:57.839> epic<00:00:58.140> scary<00:00:58.409> face

entire scary freaking epic scary face

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.680 
entire scary freaking epic scary face
that<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.039> awesome<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.789> felt<00:01:00.269> like<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.539> can

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that was awesome but I felt like you can

even<00:01:00.839> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.379> bit<00:01:01.409> crazy<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
even kind of little bit crazy there and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.820 
even kind of little bit crazy there and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
I don't agree with that but I thought it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
I don't agree with that but I thought it
was<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.129> ingenious<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.300> actual

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
was really ingenious of the actual

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
was really ingenious of the actual
writers<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.470> plot<00:01:07.800> mechanics<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
writers and the plot mechanics and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760 
writers and the plot mechanics and
devices<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.880> used<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> sense

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
devices they used with you can a sense

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.950 
plays a big freaking role in this series
and<00:04:55.980> actually<00:04:56.700> just<00:04:56.910> thinking<00:04:57.450> about<00:04:57.540> before

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
and actually just thinking about before

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.480 
and actually just thinking about before
I<00:04:57.990> started<00:04:58.200> making<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.470> review<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.980> came<00:04:59.340> to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
I started making this review I came to

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
I started making this review I came to
conclusion<00:04:59.640> that<00:05:00.030> if<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.270> think<00:05:00.450> about

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
conclusion that if you think about

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.040 
conclusion that if you think about
Nora's<00:05:00.960> name<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.470> actually<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.310> title<00:05:02.730> of

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
Nora's name is actually in the title of

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.170 
Nora's name is actually in the title of
noragami<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:05.130> didn't<00:05:05.490> really<00:05:05.580> realize<00:05:05.850> that

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
noragami so I didn't really realize that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.130 
noragami so I didn't really realize that
until<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.390> started<00:05:06.690> actually<00:05:06.900> thinking<00:05:07.080> about

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
until I started actually thinking about

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.560 
until I started actually thinking about
Nora<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.310> let's<00:05:08.820> get<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:09.000> discussion<00:05:09.360> of

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
Nora and so let's get a discussion of

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.000 
Nora and so let's get a discussion of
her<00:05:09.690> since<00:05:09.930> technically<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.620> her<00:05:10.740> name<00:05:10.890> is

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
her since technically that her name is

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.770 
her since technically that her name is
in<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.220> title<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.760> feel<00:05:12.360> like<00:05:12.480> she's<00:05:12.660> gonna

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
in the title I feel like she's gonna

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.150 
in the title I feel like she's gonna
play<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.020> major<00:05:13.260> role<00:05:13.410> in<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.680> series<00:05:13.950> I<00:05:14.040> mean

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
play a major role in the series I mean

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.770 
play a major role in the series I mean
it's<00:05:14.250> kind<00:05:14.400> of<00:05:14.460> obvious<00:05:14.610> by<00:05:14.970> now<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.390> that

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
it's kind of obvious by now and that

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.900 
it's kind of obvious by now and that
she's<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.050> regular<00:05:16.410> -<00:05:16.800> yah<00:05:17.010> -<00:05:17.040> our<00:05:17.370> main<00:05:17.640> male

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
she's a regular - yah - our main male

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.500 
she's a regular - yah - our main male
character<00:05:18.480> but<00:05:19.260> we<00:05:19.740> see<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.190> power<00:05:20.520> she<00:05:20.940> uses<00:05:21.330> in

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
character but we see a power she uses in

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.300 
character but we see a power she uses in
the<00:05:21.660> middle<00:05:21.930> of<00:05:22.080> this<00:05:22.230> fight<00:05:22.530> between<00:05:22.710> B<00:05:23.010> C<00:05:23.070> Mon

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
the middle of this fight between B C Mon

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.840 
the middle of this fight between B C Mon
and<00:05:23.580> also<00:05:24.300> yato<00:05:24.750> so<00:05:25.350> I<00:05:25.380> felt<00:05:25.890> that<00:05:26.160> since<00:05:26.670> she

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
and also yato so I felt that since she

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.610 
and also yato so I felt that since she
was<00:05:26.970> controlling<00:05:27.270> another<00:05:27.690> regularly<00:05:28.290> we

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
was controlling another regularly we

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.680 
was controlling another regularly we
literally<00:05:28.920> see<00:05:29.220> her<00:05:29.400> controlling<00:05:30.090> another

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
literally see her controlling another

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.630 
literally see her controlling another
regular<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.320> I<00:05:31.620> came<00:05:32.010> also<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.520> the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
regular and I came also to the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.760 
regular and I came also to the
conclusion<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.150> since<00:05:33.630> we<00:05:34.020> found<00:05:34.290> out<00:05:34.560> this

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
conclusion that since we found out this

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.230 
conclusion that since we found out this
episode<00:05:35.100> each<00:05:35.250> regular<00:05:35.670> has<00:05:35.850> different

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
episode each regular has different

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.300 
episode each regular has different
powers<00:05:36.720> different<00:05:37.380> forms<00:05:37.770> different<00:05:37.920> stuff

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
powers different forms different stuff

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.930 
powers different forms different stuff
like<00:05:38.520> that

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
like that

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.780 
like that
so<00:05:39.570> what<00:05:40.320> I<00:05:40.350> am<00:05:40.680> going<00:05:40.890> to<00:05:40.980> take<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.220> quick<00:05:41.520> guess

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
so what I am going to take a quick guess

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.330 
so what I am going to take a quick guess
here<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:42.540> Nora<00:05:43.140> can<00:05:43.740> control<00:05:44.100> other

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
here is that Nora can control other

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.370 
here is that Nora can control other
Regulus<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.240> what<00:05:45.480> does<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:45.630> stop<00:05:46.020> her<00:05:46.230> from

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
Regulus and what does it stop her from

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.060 
Regulus and what does it stop her from
maybe<00:05:46.620> controlling<00:05:47.220> a<00:05:47.340> god-like<00:05:48.270> yato<00:05:48.780> now<00:05:49.620> we
