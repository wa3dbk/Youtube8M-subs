00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi to all and welcome to a year 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.560
 of study today we will do 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.910
 a little tutorial on how to disable 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.110
 programs that will be on the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 marathons have windows and for mac so 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.039
 in 18th 28.1 incorporates a feature 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 interesting program control 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 who will be on startup going on there 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
 detects programs that will be 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 automatically when the system 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 operating system initializes and measures 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.340
 their impact in terms of performance of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.410
 the windows offers you the possibility of 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 locate unnecessary programs and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.260
 resource-hungry 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.170
 so here we are going to see how 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.840
 check to see the impact is disabled 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.550
 program programs that are 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.340
 launch at windows startup and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.829
 windows points 1 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.320
 first of all let's start with 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.460
 open the task manager in 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.010
 going on the taskbar well 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.520
 obviously and we will do a little click 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.310
 law 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.119
 we selected so we will 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.939
 sectioned task manager 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:30.060
 once the task manager 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:34.170
 open we'll press more than 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.829
 details to access the tab 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.420
 boot so do in click on 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.880
 the image 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.509
 so you visualize then the list of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.780
 programs that runs at startup 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:53.540
 with their status and when it's status 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.540
 and their impact at startup example 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 with the line zemma shame he has girl 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.509
 not come to rent it is activated at 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:11.099
 startup and the impact is high as 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:15.360
 you see it so it's possible 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.290
 it takes a lot of resources to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.430
 windows startup 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.069
 so from there we will be able to 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.640
 disable is then possible to 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.030
 disable the problem at startup 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.990
 so we will select the line 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.290
 corresponding 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.460
 which corresponds to software by clicking 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.730
 on the disable button you see 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.390
 right here 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:47.610
 or do a little right click and 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 done and click disable once 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.920
 disabled so I'll do it of course 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.660
 in claveau rents off them 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.180
 so once disabled 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.090
 you will gain a little speed 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:06.510
 at the launch of windows 7 windows is 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:09.420
 member still pay attention to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.560
 program that you disable some 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.190
 are essential to windows so to 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.510
 do so with no fee this would not 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:26.490
 what for an example disable by 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.580
 example I'll say as you know 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.160
 so this is my graphics card 6 the ccsi 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.080
 game so disables necessarily I would have 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.940
 display problems during the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.860
 windows startup 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:48.120
 another example that I used will see 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:52.290
 if I disable so I will inevitably 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.810
 vulnerable to malware 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.840
 so here I hope the tutorial you 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.300
 liked this is the case do not forget to 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.170
 the ouch which is of course so click on 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.849
 I like but also to share and 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.230
 leave your comments hi to all 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.060
 also see you soon on my studies 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.660
 for other tutorials thanks to all 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.660
 ciao
