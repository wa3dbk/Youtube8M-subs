00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.140

 annika are production managers that is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.150
 For example, if we are catering now 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.860
 that is, if we do something 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.780
 to produce food we have to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.689
 see to it that it runs properly 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.580
 that the goods make passive and yes we do 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.140
 check it all up a bit too 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.549
 bring new things with you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.799
 that means ideas we have for 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 products the trunks then before and then 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.850
 we decide if we want the sales 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.829
 already sitting what brought that makes 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.060
 yes, here is our logo from the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.579
 student company now is from an idea 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.189
 From the school office originated the comb 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.540
 of karate in fashion 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.030
 and we want the alumni just yet 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.250
 give up the opportunity again 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.970
 in addition a bit in this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.000
 to scrutinize economic processes and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.170
 are then then yes with two euros 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.700
 shares and two euros fifty 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.540
 and still have these stocks 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.649
 and are now at 8 8 to 10 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.479
 euro per share and so we want 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.280
 the colleagues and me with the me that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.220
 we're getting together already 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.130
 also a bit back we have 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.900
 We hold our heads down if something 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.310
 goes wrong and before something goes wrong 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.980
 intervene 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.690
 but otherwise the students are very 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.120
 very independent try that too 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.040
 really to organize everything yourself 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.710
 you get to the students very differently 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.940
 run it again is one 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.190
 I think super-atmosphere community 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.700
 Promote be a little bit or yes me 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.200
 I think so 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.670
 because we all work together too 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.260
 team and you also have to agree 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.260
 so the result is a good result
