this particular figure is of a hybrid of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.210 
this particular figure is of a hybrid of
a<00:00:20.330> way<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.630> see<00:00:21.900> Vonda<00:00:22.380> not<00:00:22.859> only<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
a way that we see Vonda not only in the
