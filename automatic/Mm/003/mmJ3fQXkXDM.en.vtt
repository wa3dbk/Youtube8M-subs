 here you will know a little about the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.370
 sound of the wave then 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.130
 so the guys at the first position 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.900
 using a bridge pickup to process 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.900
 this House is not a vague member 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.530
 now the same computer only with a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.530
 distortion 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.120
 I have 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.150
 so it was a gauge of the bridge is is a 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.340
 sound clean and overdrive sound I 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.989
 I made a card here but not now. 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.860
 I'm stronger, right? 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.730
 Now I'm going to use the computer in the middle of the 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.900
 bridge 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.900
 already in the second position 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.410
 now alone his situation 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.930
 with the guitar in this pickup where 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.550
 to the second position already has the 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.410
 combination of the two computers then 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.860
 acts like rambo that here is 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.290
 cool then just a little bit softer 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.780
 than the bridge alone but with a 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.260
 a little more banks passing the key 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.260
 of the middle pickup are cleaned 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.619
 here in the middle chapter that you 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.899
 can you get out there? 

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:24.659
 a base with a levada but he likes me 

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:26.999
 even though it was a more basic distortion 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.860
 clean has are nicer reminders up to 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.819
 a little more a single one type of guitar 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.119
 right steel 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:36.539
 if you want to make a base like this 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:38.819
 middle pickup but singing on the arm 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.689
 the key here in the fourth position on the balcony 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.689

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.569
 i 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.429
 the position of the arm for you to draw 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.610
 her nationality with clean sound and 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.610

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.500
 her nationality has a sonority 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.490
 well for funk music because it's a 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.590
 stratum ne 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.870
 Rock 'n' Roll Hard Rock One More Thing
