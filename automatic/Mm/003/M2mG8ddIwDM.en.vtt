00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 player by tv 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.890

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.940
 She lives on the beach. 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.420

 here the fernando duarte of the universe 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.270
 online I'm a little angry with you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.220
 This market is small, it's getting more 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.229
 an electronic is still a face that never 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.710
 tired comes here to take work from 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.659
 people 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 I want to see if you understand very well. 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.210
 I want to see if you're good, who was the one? 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.670
 1914 Rio champion in counterattack 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.150
 opponent against whom the team wants to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.009
 win battles open to cinch 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.500
 but I'm not going to fall for this 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.650
 to talk against which team 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 because I know that the carioca champion of 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.020
 1914 was the Flemish and how were points 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.150
 Corridos did not have that there is not what it is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.759
 hang on the catch, right? 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.020
 that the second place was the great 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.340
 eternal the sensational america had is and 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 rest assured that to be a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.180
 professional commentator like you and me 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
 I still have to train a lot 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.340
 embrace beast and we still have one more 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.939

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.649
 alves confers there the guy of the day's look 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.630
 You are known outside the fields by 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.119
 his stylish style with flaming clothes 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.159
 attention and thing and such but that shirt 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.610
 Do you prefer wearing the hopscotch? 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.720
 selection of your alternative looks without 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.720
 Tell us guys 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.540
 it is not because it is something different from what 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.219
 You use the diary so I think she 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.249
 dress much bigger than any other 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.579
 clothes that you can have inside the 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:30.420
 cabinets or seeing here is simply a 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.040
 I like privately but if you are in that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.719
 if he then asked me to give 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.150
 to choose two 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.530
 these two options surely I 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.530
 I would choose in the Brazilian national team
