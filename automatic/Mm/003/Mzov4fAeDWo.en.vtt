twist I got this idea from this rose
avail<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.789> I<00:00:17.789> think<00:00:18.150> she<00:00:18.330> did<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.600> back<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:18.960> may

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
avail and I think she did it back in may

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.000 
avail and I think she did it back in may
i'm<00:00:19.770> not<00:00:19.980> sure<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:21.380> some<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> things<00:00:22.800> are

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
i'm not sure but some of the things are

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.769 
i'm not sure but some of the things are
a<00:00:23.039> little<00:00:23.250> different<00:00:23.400> because<00:00:23.970> her<00:00:24.449> hair<00:00:24.660> was

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
a little different because her hair was

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.330 
a little different because her hair was
much<00:00:24.990> longer<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.830> i<00:00:26.310> had<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> few<00:00:28.340> few

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
much longer so i had to do a few few

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.569 
much longer so i had to do a few few
different<00:00:29.789> things<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.240> keep<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:31.579> coming

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
different things to keep it from coming

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.270 
different things to keep it from coming
down<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.750> front<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.380> think<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.010> little

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
down so the front I think it's a little

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
down so the front I think it's a little
different<00:00:35.510> but<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.200> rest<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:38.719> somewhat<00:00:39.719> not

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
different but the rest is somewhat not

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.950 
different but the rest is somewhat not
perfect<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:42.090> time<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:44.510> this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.539> how<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
perfect so first time so this is how it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.029 
perfect so first time so this is how it
looks<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> back<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> think

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
looks in the back so what do you think

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.250 
looks in the back so what do you think
I'm<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> leave<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.000> up<00:00:51.239> today<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.199> is
