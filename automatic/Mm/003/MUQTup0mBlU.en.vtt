 engineering career student 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.890
 agronomy is based on the subject effect of the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 application of three acid levels 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.720
 public with two levels of algae 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.320
 marinas to everything that can be worked 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.860
 with organic materials 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 and that are beneficial to the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.750
 producers to go leaving the the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.170
 chemists do not and use products 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.450
 organic as we are doing here 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.610

 technological alternatives valdivieso 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.160
 indicated that this system can be 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.130
 implemented in other crops 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.020
 products such as cocoa, corn and bananas 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.910

 some are going to be the best answer of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.360
 the university of guayaquil at

 the clearest intelligences 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.420
 and in this field of production 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:53.050
 agriculture and agriculture are in our 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.170
 faculty of agricultural sciences clear us 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.270
 corresponds to show that what I 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.730
 I'm saying is 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.750
 is true and what for what we have

 seen seen now the possibilities for 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.510
 that demonstration are fully

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.750
 sarmiento carri칩n reiterated the commitment 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.180
 who has his team in front of the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.550
 university accreditation us 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.680
 we have a working group that group of 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.110
 work is called science faculty 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.220
 agrarians where the authorities are 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.290
 administrative staff teachers 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.840
 students all collaborating in this 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.080
 accreditation activity because this 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.720
 faculty accredits because it accredits in the

 sense that we want to be 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.330
 even if the first ones are possible 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.210
 present our work 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.760
 accreditation that thanks to teachers 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.830
 of the faculty we have enough 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.220
 early, the results do not come true 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.580
 they have been 100 percent positive 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.050
 for the simple reason that we have 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.790
 students who are collaborating with the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.860
 university better said engineer 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.560
 graduated from our faculty who are 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.540
 collaborating with this faculty and we have

 provincial council 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.640
 and they have opened the doors to be able 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.120
 do community activities and do 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.590
 internships in the same way in addition 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.660
 we know that we already have 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.430
 professionals working in the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.969
 different institutions both

 state as well as private companies 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.749
 the experimental field of extension 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.879
 del triunfo was born thanks to the contribution of 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.499
 engineer astolfo pincay president of 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.599
 the national union of sugarcane 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:44.800
 ecuador who delivered this land in 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.629
 loan to the faculty for 20 years 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.400
 the new administration of the faculty 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.590
 of agricultural sciences plans in 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.720
 the 2013 construction of classrooms in 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.240
 these lands so that the students of 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.190
 Daule Guayaquil and Miracle receive classes 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.190
