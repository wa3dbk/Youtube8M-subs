00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.260 
where there's a lot of chatter America
in<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.439> group<00:01:53.649> with<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.979> ethiopians<00:01:54.580> sand

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and I think even at that point right or

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.600 
and I think even at that point right or
maybe<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.530> 20

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
maybe it was 20

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.470 
maybe it was 20
took<00:02:02.970> us<00:02:03.120> right<00:02:03.330> now

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
took us right now

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.120

he was looking at that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.680 
he was looking at that
to<00:02:08.130> see<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.790> we're<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.150> to<00:02:09.210> try<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.450> like

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
to see if we're going to try to like

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.510 
to see if we're going to try to like
start<00:02:10.080> pulling<00:02:10.380> them<00:02:10.500> back<00:02:10.530> in

start pulling them back in

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
start pulling them back in
I<00:02:11.610> didn't<00:02:12.180> realize<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.600> was<00:02:12.660> Joseph<00:02:13.440> outboard

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
I didn't realize I was Joseph outboard

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.610 
I didn't realize I was Joseph outboard
at<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> time<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.990> didn't

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
at the time but I kind of didn't

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.260 
at the time but I kind of didn't
surprise<00:02:16.860> me<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.490> know<00:02:17.550> he<00:02:17.880> trains<00:02:18.090> and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
surprise me because I know he trains and

Emily

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.160 
Emily
so<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> thought<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:21.510> were<00:02:21.569> may<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:22.019> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
so I thought they were may be up to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.179 
so I thought they were may be up to
something<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.920> was<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.720> know<00:02:25.069> moved<00:02:26.069> that

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
something that was you know moved that

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.429 
something that was you know moved that
should<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.459> taken<00:02:26.579> seriously<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:27.540> again<00:02:28.170> I

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
should be taken seriously but again I

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.559 
should be taken seriously but again I
was<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.620> trying<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:28.829> remember<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:30.450> know

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.610 
championships last year in New York has
a<00:02:59.220> great<00:02:59.490> cloud<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.700> course<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.470> on

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
a great cloud of course but it was on

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.800 
a great cloud of course but it was on
the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.660 
the
unlike<00:03:03.470> any<00:03:03.650> other<00:03:03.800> experience

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
unlike any other experience

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.940 
unlike any other experience
I<00:03:05.730> guess<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.900> number<00:03:07.230> 14<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.830> me

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
I guess I think this is number 14 for me

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.170 
I guess I think this is number 14 for me
so<00:03:08.190> that's<00:03:08.730> quite<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.030> few

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
and yeah they were extremely supportive

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.520 
and yeah they were extremely supportive
I<00:03:13.120> might<00:03:13.480> have<00:03:13.599> learned<00:03:13.719> a<00:03:13.870> few<00:03:14.019> high<00:03:14.260> fives

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
