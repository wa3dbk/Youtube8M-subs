instead<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.490> two<00:00:26.730> weeks<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
instead of about two weeks and the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.840 
instead of about two weeks and the
reason<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.980> how<00:00:29.160> big<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.820> is

because<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.410> increases<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.070> area<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.790> which

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
because it increases the area on which

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.360 
because it increases the area on which
you<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.330> drop<00:02:27.570> structures<00:02:27.990> such<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.530> hydras

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you can drop structures such as hydras

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.620 
you can drop structures such as hydras
and<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.640> provides<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.030> visual<00:02:30.180> point<00:02:30.540> of

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
dropping by to every time I drop assists

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.070 
dropping by to every time I drop assists
it<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.220> too<00:02:35.460> personal<00:02:35.730> resources<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.840> drop

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
it is too personal resources to drop

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.190 
it is too personal resources to drop
assists<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:38.070> gorge<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.810> very<00:02:39.990> cool

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
assists as a gorge and it's very cool

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.750 
assists as a gorge and it's very cool
now<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.410> Marines<00:02:40.770> can<00:02:40.980> shoot<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.340> cysts

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
now that Marines can shoot the cysts

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.550 
now that Marines can shoot the cysts
because<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.300> stop<00:02:42.630> infestation<00:02:43.290> spread

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
because they can stop infestation spread

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.830 
because they can stop infestation spread
before<00:02:43.740> they<00:02:44.070> get<00:02:44.220> flame<00:02:44.490> throwers<00:02:44.910> now<00:02:45.540> one

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
before they get flame throwers now one

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.570 
before they get flame throwers now one
really<00:02:46.350> annoying<00:02:46.620> thing<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.100> arcs

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
really annoying thing was that arcs

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.310 
really annoying thing was that arcs
could<00:02:47.910> shoot<00:02:48.180> without<00:02:48.390> line<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.900> sight<00:02:49.110> but

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
could shoot without line of sight but

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.770 
could shoot without line of sight but
check<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.890> these<00:02:50.460> arcs<00:02:51.150> are<00:02:51.360> shooting

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
check this out these arcs are shooting

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.420 
check this out these arcs are shooting
at<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.230> whip<00:02:52.440> because<00:02:52.800> there<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:53.100> Marines

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
at that whip because there are Marines

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.090 
at that whip because there are Marines
down<00:02:53.700> there<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.090> now<00:02:54.300> need<00:02:54.570> line<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.110> sight<00:02:55.410> to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
down there you now need line of sight to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.670 
down there you now need line of sight to
fire<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.790> arc<00:02:57.030> at<00:02:57.270> alien<00:02:57.960> structures<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
fire and arc at alien structures and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.260 
fire and arc at alien structures and
wait<00:02:58.890> for<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.250> there's<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.880> marine

base there we go ban all of those
structures<00:03:05.610> decide<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.240> see<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> scan

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
structures decide you can see the scan
