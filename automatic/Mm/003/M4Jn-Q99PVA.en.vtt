 first time on an organ of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.719
 information to Russian the news appears 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.050
 of will of the Russians participating in the

 novaya gazeta and a newspaper 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.370
 opposition 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.289
 the authorities of the donbass republic 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 they asked a group of journalists 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.460
 to accompany the bodies to the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.809
 border 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 probably to ensure that the posts 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.219
 Ukrainian blockades would not have stopped 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.500
 the refrigerator truck 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.780
 rostov authorities on the place of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.950
 arrival of the convoy refused to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.990
 make comments 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.760
 in an interview with the TV channel 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770
 french the fun 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.860
 last night Russian President Vladimir 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.049
 putin reiterated that there is no 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.159
 military intervention of the Russian army 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.159
 in the east of Ukraine 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.670
 second day of the g7 in brussels 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.980
 the first in 17 years without Russia in 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.320
 top of the agenda is the crisis in Ukraine 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.390
 unacceptable Russian action e 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.030
 must stop they declared the leaders 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.430
 of the g7 in the final release yesterday and 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.500
 they said they were ready to intensify 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.260
 targeted sanctions against fly if

 a kind has also opened up 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.120
 of the diplomatic way he would like 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 take advantage of the momentum created with 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.340
 the election of the new Ukrainian president 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.280
 knowledge that yesterday had already collected 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.310
 the preventive support of barack obama 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 the official line of the g7 therefore remains 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.500
 that of creating a cordon of 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.869

 however sustainable for countries like the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.750
 france and the germany they have big 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.840
 commercial commissions with fly but little 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.580
 realistic for the rest of Europe the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.040
 whose energy dependence on Russia 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.020
 cannot be called into question in the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.720
 short while European leaders 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.690
 will still meet the guest of 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.970
 Vladimir stone Putin in a series of
