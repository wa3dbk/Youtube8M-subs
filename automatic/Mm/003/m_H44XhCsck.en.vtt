00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello youtube name is campers like that and 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.400
 this is battlefield hotline finally 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.410
 Let's start with the videos on one 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.750
 channel to the successor of battlefield 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.219
 4 and im is battlefield 4 i got up 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.250
 and played down there was my canal 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.440
 9 and percent have four videos before 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.240
 I actually only 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.300
 Battlefield 3 played that was mine 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 many got involved in this whole story 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 and especially then also on the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.550
 Youtube channel 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.230
 and now it is slowly taking shape 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 that I've been leyen with Battlefield before 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.099
 I know that you have acclimatised 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.170
 Was last week on the cebit and was 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.610
 completely integrated and then it went 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.989
 I have not really started again 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.059
 As far as the gaming is concerned, I have it that way 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.829
 a style rather than minimal time off 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.120
 although I am already on sunday 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.320
 i have started again system 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.430
 It's been my Sunday 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.079
 Maybe somehow , too 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.329
 at least for a long time, talk briefly 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.829
 meaning value quite often asked what is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.210
 because now with the parties the windows 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.559
 the game actually how is your conclusion 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.969
 it and so on and so forth 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.309
 I live in the games to her 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 streams mostly always said yes vista 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.039
 Not only not so long now 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.539
 It would be a bit stupid there 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.920
 to say in advance how to find it or not 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.510
 conclusion to rauszuhauen 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
 because you have to do that the game of course 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.479
 already gambled a bit more 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.830
 And I stay with this statement 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.720
 I still do not have it like this 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.729
 one hundred percent up and down gambled 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 Of course I have many videos about it 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.689
 I have many tips and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.130
 Tricks to read and have 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.840
 Of course a lot is during the live 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 have tried streams now slow 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.810
 started to buy all the weapons 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.210
 and she already realizes that she will be one 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 kind my life with battlefield hotline 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 episode 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.299
 and that is exactly what it should be 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.159
 be describes here a bit 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.590
 my experience like the game 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.210
 Right now I love what I am for and before 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 disadvantages of it just on the screen 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.540
 and of course I can 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.740
 bit on the feedback what 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.909
 I stop by you during the streams 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.799
 has gotten when we speak 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.210
 Of course, always quite a lot about the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.670
 Chat or talk about people too 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.950
 straight at monza doctors power in the stream 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.939
 then stop first, then you can 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.520
 do not talk away 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.100
 there are still some problems and that is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.570
 Of course, for a start of the game 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.829
 not exactly unusual 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.460
 but first of all a thing 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.840
 clarify 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.159
 Personally , I have that now 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.990
 real lounge not like that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.759
 but one hundred percent noticed that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.049
 what I have told me what and 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.850
 what I have noticed from now on 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.350
 the people 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.759
 on the first day is riem part with tetra 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.289
 It seems relatively smooth 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.090
 So to have run only once 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.709
 applause for ea that's it at last 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.790
 I've got it well in the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.250
 past already noted 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.380
 triple a title tend to the fact that the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.940
 publisher are totally overwhelmed and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.560
 not enough server capacity for 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.360
 to make available but here you have to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.160
 Just clear the facts 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.000
 The table was certainly the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.709
 one or two small ones 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.569
 but start difficulties in no one 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.520
 wise in the order of magnitude rather that 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.260
 at Battlefield 4 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.489
 So really cool 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.020
 There are also some mistakes 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.459
 For example, a few users still have 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.200
 Directx errors because I can only 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.360
 give the tip install you 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.650
 really the latest drivers and 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.840
 not only for the graphics card but 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.130
 for the complete system try one 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.170
 other browser and you will see 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.150
 even that may already be the case 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.890
 of or have been errors 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.510
 because then remedy but that should 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.370
 Now here is no help video only 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.709
 just on the edge of the pdm sports 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.660
 I just have to be embarrassed 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.610
 unfortunately say that is an issue that 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.110
 has always been battlefield and at 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.450
 many other shooters, of course, too 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.010
 to the main topic has been made 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.200
 but here is very noticeable that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.850
 people partly that bonn where you yourself 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.350
 curious just three seconds ago 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.790
 or that one is between 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.320
 opposing sports and the one 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.120
 Of course, then directly first 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.760
 do not do that right 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.530
 fun what I read about it is that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.600
 the developer there probably already polls to 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.609
 have run or the topic has 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.720
 also already accepted have registered 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.130
 I do not want weapons on it 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.269
 that's on every shooter on 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.010
 at least at every beginning 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.709
 battlefield uta the last years so 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.560
 that the weapons were still 100,000 times 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.390
 changed and annoyed and brought no 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.560
 guess what have been patched from there 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.540
 you can probably look forward to that 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.579
 adjust that there are so many things 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.950
 the now I say a kind 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.209
 renaissance and the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.950
 We do not need netcode either 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.049
 make illusions that is a never 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.549
 ending story so the net code is after 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.260
 like before like in battlefield 4 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.030
 maybe there will be such a small update 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.410
 or something something very much 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.209
 short time ran a little better 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.829
 Currently I have to say I'm yesterday 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.450
 died again when I was already in one 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.160
 room went purely only have 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.079
 I almost hit the marca from the server 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.870
 delivered so that first time too 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.250
 the little things the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.319
 probably most of you 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.500
 just annoying when they talk about it 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.030
 the bed fitline you but not quite 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.859
 what is really cool maybe you have 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.419
 to hear how many players are watching 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.549
 are active on the consoles 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.260
 has on the pc consoles has become 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.400
 apparently sold incredibly well 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.530
 look at it like many people 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.060
 especially on the xbox straight brad 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.470
 Of course, Pitt also has line gambling 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.750
 the playstation is just right 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.120
 become a topic and on the pc altogether 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.530
 Honestly, sales are pretty 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.120
 At the back I would say so 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.740
 at least if you're just the active one 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.539
 player sees pay but I have that 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.820
 never really keep an eye on how 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.350
 strong is now under circumstances stop 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.550
 Battlefield 4 has been played then 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.080
 you would have to just four times 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.669
 starts or in this case as bf 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.470
 hotline so who is fasting 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.820
 there are times to look there 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.830
 you pay and you can pay 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.030
 right there just peek inside but 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.789
 now for the first time 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.110
 preliminary conclusion to battlefield leyen 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.460
 I have the last days now 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.900
 mainly played in the stream 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.580
 now during the daytime, that's me too 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.350
 time had two three four rounds 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.150
 gambled yes what I have not tested 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.990
 he is the single player with it 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.880
 I will be myself the next days 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.950
 to deal again with what I for 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.349
 can say it is new content it 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.690
 is new information which is not me 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.520
 I really like this new system 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.900
 you can buy weapons all over 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.580
 missions and everything is all one 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.860
 he hides a bit already 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.270
 there is our learning curve with it 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.789
 I do not like it that much 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.380
 apart from that I think the game on 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.270
 pretty successful so I have to 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.039
 Admit at the beginning I was already there 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.660
 a bit skeptical I learned there 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.130
 to deal with or 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.660
 Now that I have the game myself 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.340
 I have gambled for a few hours 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.050
 just plain for me say so yes 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.580
 For me it's a battlefield loan 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.289
 if it's for you, for example 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.340
 Nothing is quiet in it 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.349
 the comments with purely 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.940
 I think such a spin off is again 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.110
 been on time and I am pleased 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.510
 Of course, on everything else now 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.400
 first traders will come to him in 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.320
 the future but also what is now in 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.669
 battlefield 4 soon on the plan 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.960
 will stand because I have because he 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.250
 previously communicated via twitter 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.860
 get or 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.810
 then read by several users that 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.610
 probably master in battlefield 4 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.990
 but it will be heard now 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.220
 really not here 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.680
 so we have to go first 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.180
 look how much is it or if that 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.310
 then too 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.990
 through the city so battlefield leyen 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.820
 for me very exciting title 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.650
 splits that in the eye I have 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.000
 still not all game modes for me 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.280
 Of course I gambled up and down 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.509
 I meanwhile everything completely 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.370
 but just not played that way 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.750
 right all evening and me 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.639
 Just think there you have to 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.470
 think a little more time with that 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.150
 does not mean all the time so just around 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.770
 because someone is watching scrap to play 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.110
 or no idea the candles are now 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.340
 Rock, for example, is easy 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.660
 now only my weapon never a bit 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.430
 stronger and you can count on it 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.139
 leave that in the course of the 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.449
 battlefield eagle a cycle then 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.160
 also somehow downgrade 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.810
 or no idea just under 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.669
 fake or something adapted to it 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.169
 should be in the sense of mine 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.430
 name is jim panse and if that's you 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.380
 video here still on friday evening 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.660
 should have seen extreme today 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.770
 evening again from about 18 o'clock until 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.410
 about 22 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.530
 Experience has shown, of course, that 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.880
 Endings always soja for fun 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.289
 see in the sense we see each other 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.289
 until then, it makes good townships
