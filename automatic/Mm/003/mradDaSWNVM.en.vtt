00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
into 10 to 1 this morning a lot shorter

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.779 
into 10 to 1 this morning a lot shorter
so<00:00:56.739> I<00:00:56.770> suppose<00:00:57.039> with<00:00:57.309> Tottenham<00:00:57.550> you've<00:00:57.640> not

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.120 
way they played they would have took it
if<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.900> give<00:01:41.110> them<00:01:41.140> top<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.619> withdraw<00:01:41.979> before

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
if you give them top and withdraw before

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.740 
if you give them top and withdraw before
the<00:01:42.400> game<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:43.000> way<00:01:43.150> that<00:01:43.299> they've<00:01:43.450> played

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
they wouldn't off and that's why for the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.520 
they wouldn't off and that's why for the
last<00:01:46.030> 20<00:01:46.299> minutes<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.570> first<00:01:46.720> half<00:01:47.020> there<00:01:47.439> are

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
three great chances and took the game by

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.700 
three great chances and took the game by
the<00:01:49.270> scruff<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.720> neck<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:50.020> was<00:01:50.140> only<00:01:50.290> after

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
the scruff of the neck it was only after

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.679 
the scruff of the neck it was only after
they'd<00:01:51.040> scored<00:01:51.399> that<00:01:51.520> Liverpool<00:01:52.000> thought<00:01:52.390> out

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
they'd scored that Liverpool thought out

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.109 
they'd scored that Liverpool thought out
on<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:52.930> minute<00:01:53.200> yeah<00:01:53.829> we've<00:01:54.729> got<00:01:54.880> like<00:01:55.000> now

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
on a minute yeah we've got like now

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.060 
on a minute yeah we've got like now
shake<00:01:55.450> our<00:01:55.600> ideas<00:01:55.930> up<00:01:56.079> and<00:01:56.229> try<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.470> get<00:01:56.890> back

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
shake our ideas up and try and get back

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.249 
shake our ideas up and try and get back
in<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.369> game<00:01:57.460> yeah<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:59.110> was<00:01:59.229> a

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
in this game yeah and that was a

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.660 
in this game yeah and that was a
difference<00:01:59.560> lived<00:01:59.710> for<00:01:59.890> would<00:01:59.979> have<00:02:00.070> they

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
difference lived for would have they

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.609 
difference lived for would have they
could<00:02:00.939> have<00:02:01.000> played<00:02:01.210> there<00:02:01.360> all<00:02:01.450> day<00:02:01.630> in<00:02:01.899> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
could have played there all day in the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.929 
could have played there all day in the
game<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.920> reflected<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.460> first<00:02:03.670> 20<00:02:03.909> minutes

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
game and reflected the first 20 minutes

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.730 
game and reflected the first 20 minutes
they<00:02:04.899> wouldn't<00:02:05.079> have<00:02:05.229> won<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.439> game<00:02:05.590> but

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
they wouldn't have won that game but

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.929 
they wouldn't have won that game but
they'd<00:02:05.890> have<00:02:06.009> been<00:02:06.100> happy<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.460> go<00:02:06.579> away<00:02:06.759> with

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
they'd have been happy to go away with

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.430 
they'd have been happy to go away with
the<00:02:07.000> draw<00:02:07.180> yeah<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.540> think<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.049> reflects<00:02:08.320> the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
the draw yeah I think it reflects the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.840 
the draw yeah I think it reflects the
confidence<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.070> Tottenham's<00:02:09.459> camp<00:02:09.700> when

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
confidence in Tottenham's camp when

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.830 
confidence in Tottenham's camp when
they're<00:02:09.970> at<00:02:10.060> home<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.509> seemed<00:02:10.690> like

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
they're at home to it seemed like

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.970 
they're at home to it seemed like
Liverpool<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.650> they're<00:02:11.739> trying<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.319 
Liverpool on that and they're trying to
win<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.220> match<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.579> shows<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:12.970> believe

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
win that match it shows that I believe

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.030

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
credit they deserve because for many

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.309 
credit they deserve because for many
many<00:02:39.939> years<00:02:40.090> they<00:02:40.359> went<00:02:40.540> under<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.840> radar<00:02:41.049> it

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
many years they went under the radar it

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.119 
many years they went under the radar it
wasn't<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:42.159> wasn't<00:02:42.310> even<00:02:42.459> known<00:02:42.819> about<00:02:43.180> that

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
wasn't it wasn't even known about that

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.619 
wasn't it wasn't even known about that
the<00:02:45.129> players<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.670> those<00:02:45.879> did<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.299> job<00:02:46.450> they

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
the players like those did the job they

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.240 
the players like those did the job they
did<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.989> think<00:02:47.200> because<00:02:47.739> you've<00:02:47.889> got<00:02:48.069> now

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
did but I think because you've got now

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.940 
did but I think because you've got now
more<00:02:48.849> football<00:02:49.090> being<00:02:49.389> covered<00:02:49.659> and<00:02:49.959> people

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
more football being covered and people

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.259 
more football being covered and people
are<00:02:51.010> better<00:02:51.189> educated<00:02:51.400> there's<00:02:51.939> no<00:02:52.060> doubt

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
are better educated there's no doubt

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.179 
are better educated there's no doubt
about<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.510> what<00:02:52.810> they<00:02:52.930> watch<00:02:53.169> now<00:02:53.439> you<00:02:54.069> know

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
about that what they watch now you know

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.789 
about that what they watch now you know
through<00:02:54.459> listening<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.540> X<00:02:55.689> players<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.319> see

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
what's important in the game because it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.000 
what's important in the game because it
isn't<00:02:58.209> just<00:02:58.389> about<00:02:58.569> was<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:59.409> what<00:02:59.560> looks<00:02:59.769> nice

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
have got that little bit of firepower

have got that little bit of firepower
that<00:04:00.099> little<00:04:00.430> bit<00:04:00.549> more<00:04:00.699> belief<00:04:01.030> but<00:04:01.629> it<00:04:01.720> would

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
that little bit more belief but it would

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.420 
that little bit more belief but it would
be<00:04:01.840> an<00:04:02.019> interesting<00:04:02.079> encounter<00:04:02.620> don't<00:04:03.189> see<00:04:03.400> a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430

heart<00:04:05.560> possibly<00:04:06.099> Tottenham<00:04:06.459> might<00:04:06.609> sneak<00:04:06.909> it

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
heart possibly Tottenham might sneak it

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.300
