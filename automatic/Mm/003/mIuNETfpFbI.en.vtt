crack this open alright so here we

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.910 
crack this open alright so here we
got<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> differential<00:00:47.850> cover<00:00:48.379> it's<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.620> well

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
got a differential cover it's very well

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.869 
got a differential cover it's very well
made<00:00:50.510> here's<00:00:51.510> our<00:00:51.750> cable<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> went<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.620> us<00:00:52.879> 78

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
made here's our cable I went with us 78

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
made here's our cable I went with us 78
I<00:00:54.180> believe<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.110> was

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
I believe it is that what was

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.700 
I believe it is that what was
recommended<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.100> TJ<00:00:57.199> now<00:00:58.199> hopefully<00:00:58.379> that's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
recommended for TJ now hopefully that's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.439 
recommended for TJ now hopefully that's
the<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.190> length<00:00:59.219> otherwise<00:00:59.910> I'll<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the right length otherwise I'll have to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.990 
the right length otherwise I'll have to
make<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.629> work<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:02.149> with<00:01:03.149> flip<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.660> over

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
make it work so out with flip this over

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.540 
make it work so out with flip this over
there's<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.180> shift<00:01:06.540> fork<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.200> there

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.490 

looks<00:01:11.550> like<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:12.090> good<00:01:12.270> quality

videos that they have ox locker and they

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.710 
videos that they have ox locker and they
crack<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.700> cover<00:01:20.940> that's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.450> solid

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
crack the cover that's a pretty solid

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.700 
crack the cover that's a pretty solid
cover

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710

cover
not<00:01:23.220> sure<00:01:23.460> how<00:01:23.640> you'd<00:01:23.850> crack<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> let's<00:01:24.510> just

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
not sure how you'd crack it let's just

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.270 
not sure how you'd crack it let's just
imagine<00:01:24.870> something<00:01:25.620> anyways<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.100> not

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
imagine something anyways I'm not

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
imagine something anyways I'm not
denying<00:01:26.670> anything<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> look<00:01:28.650> at

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
denying anything this is what I look at

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.060 
denying anything this is what I look at
the<00:01:28.860> actual<00:01:29.250> locker<00:01:29.729> itself<00:01:30.710> here's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.830> quick

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the actual locker itself here's a quick

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.090 
the actual locker itself here's a quick
look<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> shifter<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.510> always<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.620> careful

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
look at the shifter I always be careful

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.650 
look at the shifter I always be careful
because<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.400> went<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.790> piss<00:01:36.030> around<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
because I went to go piss around with it

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.330 
because I went to go piss around with it
and<00:01:36.720> lock<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.260> then<00:01:37.320> there's<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.010> brick

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and lock it and then there's this brick

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
and lock it and then there's this brick
in<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:38.729> shot<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.120> plastic<00:01:39.630> end<00:01:39.780> out

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
in there and shot the plastic end out

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.260 
in there and shot the plastic end out
and<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.200> sounds<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.530> piece<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
and this sounds a little piece so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.130 
and this sounds a little piece so
hopefully<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.420> wasn't<00:01:42.720> something<00:01:42.930> else

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
hopefully there wasn't something else

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.710 
hopefully there wasn't something else
that<00:01:43.410> might<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.710> went<00:01:43.830> missing<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.369> noise

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
that might have went missing but noise

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
that might have went missing but noise

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
nice here's the locker and you can tell

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.590 
nice here's the locker and you can tell
that's<00:01:52.170> very<00:01:52.500> good<00:01:52.650> quality<00:01:53.119> machine<00:01:54.119> it's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
that's very good quality machine it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870 
that's very good quality machine it's
really<00:01:54.899> nice<00:01:55.110> every<00:01:55.560> bolt<00:01:55.860> has<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.250> locking<00:01:56.520> tab

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880

is<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.380> press-on<00:02:56.890> bearings<00:02:57.370> and<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:01.420> case<00:03:01.630> if

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
is like press-on bearings and in case if

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
both it'll be really good once I start

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.590 
both it'll be really good once I start
working<00:03:14.050> on<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:17.820> see<00:03:18.820> just<00:03:19.090> how<00:03:19.239> easy

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
working on it and we see just how easy

working on it and we see just how easy
this<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.170> gonna<00:03:20.350> be<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.769> install<00:03:23.400> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
this is gonna be to install and

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
troubleshooting what bearings do use you

looks like it's very well made the real
test<00:03:43.120> will<00:03:43.360> come<00:03:43.780> when<00:03:44.110> we<00:03:44.560> install<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.010> and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
test will come when we install it and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.860 
test will come when we install it and
see<00:03:45.489> how<00:03:45.850> well<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.060> works<00:03:46.329> after<00:03:46.600> its

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
installation problems so hopefully oh we

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.250 
installation problems so hopefully oh we
don't<00:03:55.090> have<00:03:55.209> any<00:03:55.450> issues<00:03:55.810> doing<00:03:56.170> the
