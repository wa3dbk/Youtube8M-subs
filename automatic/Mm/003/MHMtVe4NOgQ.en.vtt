I feel that my foundation stayed on it
looks<00:03:07.840> pretty<00:03:08.230> much<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.500> same<00:03:08.680> from<00:03:09.340> when<00:03:09.640> I

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
looks pretty much the same from when I

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.699 
looks pretty much the same from when I
put<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.090> on<00:03:10.180> over<00:03:10.690> six<00:03:10.989> hours<00:03:11.170> ago

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
put it on over six hours ago

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.949 
put it on over six hours ago
again<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.520> don't<00:03:12.700> feel<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.600> feels<00:03:13.780> any

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
again I don't feel that it feels any

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.410 
again I don't feel that it feels any
cakey<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.830> hasn't<00:03:15.370> oxidized<00:03:15.910> throughout<00:03:16.270> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
cakey it hasn't oxidized throughout the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.110 
cakey it hasn't oxidized throughout the
day<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:16.930> yeah<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.860> actually<00:03:18.100> don't<00:03:18.519> feel<00:03:18.850> too

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
day and yeah I actually don't feel too

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.560 
day and yeah I actually don't feel too
oily<00:03:19.450> either<00:03:20.400> my<00:03:21.400> skin<00:03:21.760> still<00:03:22.060> looks<00:03:22.090> glowing

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
oily either my skin still looks glowing

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.990 
oily either my skin still looks glowing
so<00:03:22.959> overall<00:03:23.860> I<00:03:23.890> think<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> pretty<00:03:24.790> good

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000

oil<00:03:56.800> isn't<00:03:57.400> seeping<00:03:58.000> through<00:03:58.060> because<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.780> is

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
oil isn't seeping through because it is

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.020 
oil isn't seeping through because it is
oil<00:03:59.140> free<00:03:59.260> one<00:03:59.920> thing<00:04:00.100> I'm<00:04:00.220> not<00:04:00.340> too<00:04:00.550> fond<00:04:00.850> of
