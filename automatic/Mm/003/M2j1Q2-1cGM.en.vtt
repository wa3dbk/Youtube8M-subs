00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
cheese and with a fine grater just grate

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.820 
cheese and with a fine grater just grate
some<00:05:16.000> right<00:05:16.390> on<00:05:16.600> to<00:05:16.840> each<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.470> triangles

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
some right on to each of the triangles

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.370 
some right on to each of the triangles
again<00:05:18.640> trying<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.360> cover<00:05:19.690> as<00:05:19.870> much<00:05:20.050> of<00:05:20.110> the

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.489 

now<00:05:51.159> once<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:51.669> get<00:05:51.819> all<00:05:52.119> the<00:05:52.330> ham<00:05:52.599> placed<00:05:53.139> it's

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:53.499 
now once you get all the ham placed it's

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:56.219 
now once you get all the ham placed it's
time<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:54.009> start<00:05:54.309> rolling<00:05:54.520> these<00:05:54.969> up<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:56.020> what<00:05:56.199> I

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
time to start rolling these up so what I

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.159 
time to start rolling these up so what I
do<00:05:56.349> is<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.860> start<00:05:56.919> at<00:05:57.369> the<00:05:57.490> base<00:05:57.789> the<00:05:58.419> wide<00:05:58.659> end

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
do is I start at the base the wide end

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.249 
do is I start at the base the wide end
and<00:05:59.529> I<00:05:59.889> just<00:05:59.919> start<00:06:00.789> rolling<00:06:01.330> them<00:06:01.539> up<00:06:01.779> tucking

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
and I just start rolling them up tucking

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.719 
and I just start rolling them up tucking
in<00:06:02.559> the<00:06:02.649> ham<00:06:02.860> as<00:06:03.069> I<00:06:03.219> go<00:06:03.459> and<00:06:05.189> just<00:06:06.189> keep<00:06:06.429> rolling

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
in the ham as I go and just keep rolling

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.359 
in the ham as I go and just keep rolling
they<00:06:07.509> don't<00:06:07.749> have<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.229> look<00:06:08.409> perfect<00:06:08.679> you<00:06:09.159> can

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:09.369 
they don't have to look perfect you can

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.179 
they don't have to look perfect you can
tuck<00:06:09.639> some<00:06:09.909> cheese<00:06:10.209> in<00:06:10.240> as<00:06:10.659> you<00:06:10.869> go<00:06:11.039> but<00:06:12.039> the

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:12.189 
tuck some cheese in as you go but the

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.239 
tuck some cheese in as you go but the
idea<00:06:12.580> is<00:06:12.969> as<00:06:13.360> you<00:06:13.869> roll<00:06:14.169> them<00:06:14.439> and<00:06:14.709> place<00:06:15.009> them

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:15.249 
idea is as you roll them and place them

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.510 
idea is as you roll them and place them
on<00:06:15.399> the<00:06:15.550> baking<00:06:15.699> sheet<00:06:15.969> keep<00:06:16.509> that<00:06:16.779> little

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
on the baking sheet keep that little

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.639 
on the baking sheet keep that little
pointy<00:06:18.520> side<00:06:18.999> down<00:06:19.539> on<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.050> baking<00:06:20.619> sheet

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:20.649 
pointy side down on the baking sheet

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:22.619 
pointy side down on the baking sheet
that<00:06:21.069> way<00:06:21.249> when<00:06:21.490> they<00:06:21.669> puff<00:06:21.969> up<00:06:22.240> they<00:06:22.479> don't

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:22.629 
that way when they puff up they don't

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
that way when they puff up they don't
unroll<00:06:26.699> then<00:06:27.699> just<00:06:28.029> kind<00:06:28.300> of<00:06:28.449> rearrange<00:06:28.899> these

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:29.649 
unroll then just kind of rearrange these

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:32.010 
unroll then just kind of rearrange these

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
on the sheet so each one has plenty of

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.649 
on the sheet so each one has plenty of
room<00:06:32.409> to<00:06:32.709> cook<00:06:32.979> and<00:06:33.249> puff<00:06:33.550> up<00:06:33.819> and<00:06:34.029> then<00:06:34.479> these
