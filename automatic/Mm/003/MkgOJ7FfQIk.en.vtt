00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello everyone with you Kate and today I would 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.759
 I wanted to explain why we need these 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.500
 books in maykravt they appeared recently 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:26.779
 and they can be used for enchantment 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:33.180
 things that is a weapon a weapon then 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:37.380
 tools and what's more clothes so 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.920
 here for example let's give for this to us 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.579
 need an anvil she craft here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 so what do we take such 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:57.270
 bow and infinity shoot to arrows 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.760
 we had endless now check 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:09.140
 it's probably not worth it with you 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:13.560
 doubt it yes all infinity 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.670
 then also we can impose this bow 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 one more effect and not knowing how much 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:31.579
 maximum like 5 so burning arrow 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.579
 here is infinity burning then 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 let's go 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:46.200
 what is prey 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:54.250
 that we can still have reclining 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:02:06.370
 how many we already have 4 infinity 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:11.080
 penalty car recoil 7 and death 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:18.060
 insects more heavenly punishment is 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:20.620
 countries with sharpness 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.260
 wait and then does not overlap 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:31.830
 not superimposed incomprehensible. 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.830
 moba where you look now 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.730
 I'm all over 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:56.109
 okay, this is a couple it will be easier to sleep 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:03:18.069
 let's say skeleton okay yes and how not 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:22.569
 tired of what they attack fast wolf here 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:28.239
 see first shot plus and carries on 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:33.959
 a few meters away from us repulsion mr 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:36.419
 cary did not burn this endless arrows 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:43.049
 the acuity still works 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:43.049
 that's as far as weapons are concerned 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:58.420
 clothes 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:04:07.990
 so things things no longer need me where where 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:14.850
 here is fire protection then so strength 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.850
 can also enter and then fire resistance 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:26.410
 weightlessness explosion resistance from 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:33.450
 creeper projectiles protection and so 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.450
 skeletons and gas probably underwater breathing 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:45.630
 then the submariner is not the same 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.630
 thorns what are we trying to wear 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:12.560
 Vitek where it is water water but drain 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.920
 photo we have the same creative something from the stage 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.130
 now pisek 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:34.950
 in general, I looked underwater breathing 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.950
 gives us or whatever it is called 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.250
 underwater breathing gives us the ability 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.670
 longer stay underwater and diver 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:53.110
 I still do not understand what exactly gives then 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:55.500
 onions replace oh yeah how nice 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:03.310
 feel dominated 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:05.010
 those who always scared you in caves like 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:13.090
 see the shelves 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:15.780
 die with one shot you could too 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.780
 maybe nissan 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.070
