 knows as you already put them on tomÃ¡s 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.960
 they really know that the title feels 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.110
 always named after the seeds 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.539
 then well you know they're going to see 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.770
 this seed a chulada the truth and 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.370
 Well, we're recording right now 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.840

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.940

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.309
 comment and a shitload of heat then good 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.710
 let's comment I'm excited but 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.480
 good this seed what has 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.070
 interesting is that when you 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.859
 you are going to leave they are going to say that 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.269
 but what three these seeds well 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.370
 I put it in creative mode for 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.850
 that you show them and relax can not 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.780
 see how they can see is how kind 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.150
 archipelagos I do not know if they know archi 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.490
 but they are a few pieces air 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.960
 and then good then bring as not 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.300
 I know if they remember when a video came up 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.460
 in the creative way or something like that 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.860
 Well, talk about that a river was coming and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.920
 all that and that went through the entire map 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.870
 not good so this seed comes 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.240
 when I saw her I thought they were pure islands 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.790
 so small but not three in their pieces 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.220
 good as you were to see next 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.660
 some plateaus a little mountain keep cool 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.720
 cool very father the truth is that to me 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.340
 I really like this type of mountain 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.570
 you do not see parents and so good here is 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.140
 the first village that we're going to see 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.970
 continuation a very small village 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.380
 because nothing else creates a little house 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.210
 hence one tidbits 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.530
 well, it would save us the time 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.509
 walk doing what would be the farm 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.100
 that the truth that here would not like 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.539
 save that time and well as good as 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.090
 happen here as you can see the village 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.210
 very small chiquitita very relax the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.189
 true and well, this is something that 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.039
 well, we find it quickly 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.509
 Well, there they will see what they would be 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.590
 they saw my way of jumping I do not know why 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.660
 what my control like that is failing me 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.370
 but good that's the least 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.470
 here as you can see are the mountains 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.000
 very parents is the part of that they seem 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.160
 some that appear pixelar yes also 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.540
 from the creative point of view the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.640
 can see as a pixel type the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.080
 true that he looks very cool father already 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.730

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.650

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.769
 they look very much like that exotic and the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.900
