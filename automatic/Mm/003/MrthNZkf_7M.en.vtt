00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
students really were so sick as soon as

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.520 
students really were so sick as soon as
we<00:02:07.360> left<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:08.080> all<00:02:08.229> pretty<00:02:08.830> much<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:11.020> seems<00:02:11.350> like

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
we left it all pretty much it seems like

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.370 
we left it all pretty much it seems like
a<00:02:11.560> story<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.250> never<00:02:12.459> stops<00:02:12.910> repeating<00:02:13.540> at

a story that never stops repeating at
one<00:02:14.590> point<00:02:14.890> I'd<00:02:15.100> like<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.310> make<00:02:15.670> about<00:02:15.820> this

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
one point I'd like to make about this

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.030 
one point I'd like to make about this
school<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.900> heard<00:02:17.080> reports<00:02:17.470> about<00:02:17.800> this

now the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.479 
now the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station
was<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.200> epitome<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.709> what<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.130> would<00:03:06.250> call<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
was the epitome of what you would call a

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.090 
was the epitome of what you would call a
transient<00:03:07.090> community<00:03:07.680> people<00:03:08.680> would<00:03:08.829> be<00:03:08.950> here

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
transient community people would be here

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.550 
transient community people would be here
for<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> year<00:03:09.670> or<00:03:09.790> two<00:03:09.940> today<00:03:10.600> everyone<00:03:11.410> is

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
for a year or two today everyone is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.229 
for a year or two today everyone is
somewhere<00:03:11.920> else<00:03:11.980> folks<00:03:12.489> are<00:03:12.670> all<00:03:12.880> over<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
somewhere else folks are all over the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.850 
somewhere else folks are all over the
world<00:03:13.450> now<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.720> mean<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.200> families<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.709> would

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
world now I mean the families that would

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.250 
world now I mean the families that would
send<00:03:15.070> kids<00:03:15.280> here<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:16.299> include<00:03:16.660> at<00:03:16.840> school<00:03:17.079> it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
send kids here and include at school it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.110 
send kids here and include at school it
closed<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.769> 99<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.160> believe<00:03:18.489> so<00:03:18.640> it's<00:03:18.790> been<00:03:18.910> 10

years<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:20.410> know<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.489> latency<00:03:21.850> effects

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
years you know and the latency effects

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.729 
years you know and the latency effects
of<00:03:22.269> cancer<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.930> talking<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.320> big<00:03:23.500> delay

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
of cancer it's talking a big delay

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.100 
of cancer it's talking a big delay
between<00:03:24.090> exposure<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.239> something<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:25.690> TCE

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
in their family before then they have

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.910 
in their family before then they have
something<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:49.090> look<00:03:49.270> at<00:03:49.480> as<00:03:49.720> well<00:03:49.930> my<00:03:50.620> father

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
something to look at as well my father

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.840 
something to look at as well my father
served<00:03:51.400> or<00:03:51.790> my<00:03:52.390> mother<00:03:52.660> was<00:03:52.960> at<00:03:53.170> at<00:03:53.590> El<00:03:54.280> Toro<00:03:54.550> or

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
served or my mother was at at El Toro or

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.810 
served or my mother was at at El Toro or
I<00:03:55.210> worked<00:03:55.900> at<00:03:56.110> el<00:03:56.260> Toro<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.430> that's<00:03:57.640> the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
I worked at el Toro and so that's the

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.770 
I worked at el Toro and so that's the
other<00:03:57.970> big<00:03:58.390> issue<00:03:58.660> is<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.860> DNA<00:04:00.670> bending<00:04:01.240> if

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
other big issue is the DNA bending if

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.450 
other big issue is the DNA bending if
