because<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.580> get<00:02:37.700> these<00:02:37.820> cases<00:02:38.270> of

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
because you get these cases of

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
because you get these cases of
Technology<00:02:39.020> companies<00:02:39.380> starting<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.920> exert

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
Technology companies starting to exert

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.130 
Technology companies starting to exert
too<00:02:40.490> much<00:02:40.520> leverage<00:02:40.880> over<00:02:41.330> their<00:02:41.480> users<00:02:41.870> and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
too much leverage over their users and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.570 
too much leverage over their users and
then<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> users<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.070> come<00:02:43.340> up<00:02:43.370> with

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
then the users have to come up with

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.120 
then the users have to come up with
creative<00:02:43.820> ways<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.210> fight<00:02:44.720> back<00:02:45.530> at<00:02:45.740> them<00:02:45.890> and

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
creative ways to fight back at them and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.380 
creative ways to fight back at them and
in<00:02:46.460> this<00:02:46.580> case<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.940> seems<00:02:47.120> counterintuitive

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
in this case it seems counterintuitive

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.120 
in this case it seems counterintuitive
because<00:02:47.960> if<00:02:48.110> anybody<00:02:48.350> who<00:02:48.560> doesn't<00:02:48.830> know<00:02:49.010> the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130
