00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.360
 new citroen c5 a car that is going to be put on sale soon on 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.029
 end of november 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.070
 in this case 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.170
 is a new engine of 6 or see it full version 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.030
 and also with the most powerful engine is the 215 horsepower 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.140
 and when going to compete the one of the imported chin checks 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.570
 more crowded by booking some way with a referrer that of course 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.100
 is he borba in passing but there is also the reindeer lagoon the mondeo forum 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.260
 i his cousin brother of yours 407 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.430
 This explains completely how the physiognomies of what the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.470
 citroen to this day iturriaga cars as you decide 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.890
 Frenchified 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.220
 the three is order this model be the same sex indicated by a car 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.140
 it is going well conventional but it was too successful not only the Argentine but 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.060
 neither in europe 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.700
 I can 10 of 20 learned the completely different auto isidora lesson 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.930
 with a tendency absolutely German self if the Germans and in trend 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.540
 put the surrounds very forward the French prefer to have the further back 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 and with a longer whirlpool 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.930
 tote with the perfomance credit engines of six known from now 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.160
 many years of origin peru I do not even think they use other brands 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.110
 this power as I said 215 horses at 6 thousand laps and has a torque of 30 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.250
 kilograms that operated at 3 thousand 750 laps which means this for 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.570
 demand them to take it out potential that they have to take advantage of that power there 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.220
 to throw change over the 5 thousand laps for the engine to work 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.220
 always between four and six thousand 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.100
 the box is automatic six-speed from 0 to 100 is in the order of 9 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.680
 7 points according to 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.090
 and in the 30 seconds to cover the thousand kilometers good the maximum oroya that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.520
 lean transport the sixth is one on gear that drops approximately 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.460
 about one thousand 100 spin of motor 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.409
 what makes consumption lower 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.869
 the engine regime lower but loses approximately 1 4 5 kilometers per 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.349
 hour with respect to the maximum 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.980
 with his humor consumption is not one of his virtues 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.200
 but neither are they harassed ghostly 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.680
 eta in the order less than 16 liters per 100 km of the city 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 exactly 15 as well 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.650
 his opponent is of course they are below his apparent 13 and 14 but 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.650
 always this motor with engine that in the city consumes enough 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.339
 I 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:45.269
 one of the great challenges of this model and that it has an advantage over the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.449
 name competence before that level of equipment both for safety and for 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.449
 comfort with respect to your rival 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.480
 the regulation of 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880
 security that is composed of seven stolen 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.840
 of course it has bs and traction control and has quality control or 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.249
 everything that was necessary for security 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.249
 this one in standard equipment 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.859
 I went inside comfort also everything comes because beyond lifting and the 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.540
 which are four selective folding mirrors and all that is conventional 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.219
 in a car of this type also has three goals said to be triggered by 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.109
 of a key that is the central console 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.840
 has a system d his pension called hydro assets trek plus 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.989
 where we would control based on speed and surface 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.989
 the hardness of the shock absorbers and so on 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.719
 Peter his pension has the advantage that one can also opt for a 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.609
 Comfort suspension as the suppression absolutely sporty 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:42.639
 on the other hand 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.219
 the gearbox also has positions because it pulls the changes in 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.790
 automatic beyond what they know you normal position has a 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:53.480
 tendency to ride comfort but sport position the car really gets 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.730
 behaves like a sports car to say it in some way 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.630
 the box as I said is 6 marches 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.230
 and also chepo use manually as is common in almost all of today 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.230
 eta cajasur a tiptronic of origin of the volkswagen group 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:17.690
 quito solar this car does not have it but what is going to sell to match I moved 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.689
 hungry because this is an exclusive advancement they will have sunroof 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.849
 By now three snap isofix hooks help the brace earring that are very 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.919
 interesting because 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.529
 especially for the woman and that generally the author of the 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:32.300
 book is going backwards they do not know what to do 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.970
 solar side curtain and corvina de las heras and automatic climate control 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.780
 bizona as it looks like that though general 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.780
 of really complete comfort equipment 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.719
 let's conclude the town crier raised the price that still does not 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.460
 it is absolutely defined 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.730
 but if we consider piquÃ© the still as a reference is the pastime where 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.039
 is the gold number 58 thousand dollars we have to think I am a self-taught 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.399
 20 54 55 count and senile 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.080
 perfect goes to the conclusions in favor with ford underway undoubtedly and 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.069
 also the suspension system due to type 3 is really efficient in a 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.069
 self that behaves very well both silva as never 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.360
 road behavior 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.400
 soundproofing been very well and sodomized from here he has videos 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.850
 Lateral laminate 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.630
 and that makes the car very well soundproofed even high 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.370
 speeds that is to say there is no wind noise as we call it to read me 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.910
 the standard equipment is another point in favor 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.450
 and certainly with respect to the previous c5 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.510
 you are much better finished and with much better material 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.400
 against warranty the guarantee must be this type of cars in which it will be 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.449
 of three years and we are always between two years 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:06.539
 over the years I do not think it's enough for another type because it's also 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.139
 at stake also the image of the brand for a car that is practically top 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.999
 of the range 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:17.319
 the most back was psoe are not too generous is to go the car still watching your 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.279
 size by the rear seats only just 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.279
 this ali tablet than the previous version 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.039
 the city consumption is relatively high and the visibility later this 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.419
 pretty pretty limited 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.270
 and finally in the benefits with respect let's say room 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.210
 paragraph hands of the engine v6 and the pro forma of the sonic general author joust 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.639
 we would say in both the limit within the logic for a category car and 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.639
 this type but we are not to say perfrom brown tie 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:53.990
 in general if I had to do a score this car from 0 to 10 what here 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.490
 just above the g8
