the<00:02:42.080> last<00:02:42.350> year<00:02:42.620> or<00:02:42.709> two<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.500> change

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
the last year or two and it's a change

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.090 
the last year or two and it's a change
so<00:02:45.830> minimally<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.350> we<00:02:48.800> have<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:48.980> good

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
so minimally that I we have a good

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.449 
so minimally that I we have a good
relationship<00:02:49.250> going<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.070> big<00:02:52.220> fan<00:02:52.250> of

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
relationship going and I'm a big fan of

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.650 
relationship going and I'm a big fan of
these<00:02:52.640> blue-chip<00:02:53.000> picks<00:02:54.459> also<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:56.420> might<00:02:56.570> not

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
these blue-chip picks also you might not

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.270 
these blue-chip picks also you might not
be<00:02:56.750> able<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.900> see<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.200> from<00:02:57.380> that<00:02:57.440> angle<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:58.040> if

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
be able to see it from that angle but if

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.070 
be able to see it from that angle but if
I<00:02:58.430> turn<00:02:58.489> my<00:02:58.760> mandolin<00:02:59.090> around<00:03:01.750> I've<00:03:02.750> got<00:03:02.959> this

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
I turn my mandolin around I've got this

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.780 
I turn my mandolin around I've got this
thing<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.470> think<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.709> called<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:03.980> tone<00:03:04.220> guard<00:03:04.580> I

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
thing I think it's called a tone guard I

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.180 
thing I think it's called a tone guard I
don't<00:03:05.630> really<00:03:05.840> like<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.140> way<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.320> looks<00:03:06.560> but<00:03:06.650> I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
don't really like the way it looks but I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.430 
don't really like the way it looks but I
can't<00:03:07.670> argue<00:03:07.790> with<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.090> way<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.390> sounds<00:03:08.870> this

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
can't argue with the way it sounds this

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.449 
can't argue with the way it sounds this
guy<00:03:09.800> keeps<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.850> mandolin<00:03:11.209> off<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.480> my<00:03:11.600> stomach

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.400 
guy keeps the mandolin off of my stomach
and<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.700> really<00:03:13.880> gives<00:03:14.600> me<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:14.750> lot<00:03:14.810> more<00:03:14.930> volume

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and it really gives me a lot more volume

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.479 
and it really gives me a lot more volume
allows<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.580> back<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.140> vibrate<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.400> it's

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
allows the back to vibrate and and it's

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.479 
allows the back to vibrate and and it's
not<00:03:19.640> dulled<00:03:20.060> by<00:03:20.180> being<00:03:21.140> up<00:03:21.230> against<00:03:21.620> my

this one sounds it I think it's a it's a
beautiful<00:03:53.000> man<00:03:53.360> one<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.690> seems<00:03:53.870> to

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
beautiful man one that seems to

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.130 
beautiful man one that seems to
complement<00:03:55.519> my<00:03:56.239> style<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.250> like<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.810> I

think F sound good I think a sound good
I<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:02.330> think<00:04:02.510> this<00:04:02.720> particular<00:04:02.930> mandolin<00:04:03.590> is

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769

I just think this particular mandolin is
it's<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.340> great<00:04:04.519> mandolin<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.959> maybe<00:04:06.200> I'll

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
it's a great mandolin and maybe I'll

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.920 
it's a great mandolin and maybe I'll
play<00:04:07.310> us<00:04:07.519> out<00:04:07.669> with<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.329> same<00:04:08.570> whiskey

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
play us out with that same whiskey
