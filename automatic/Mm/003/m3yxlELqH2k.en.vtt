building the snow board in my basement

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.780 
building the snow board in my basement
and<00:00:08.790> I've<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.990> whole<00:00:10.230> thing<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.980> tape<00:00:11.160> so

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
and I've got the whole thing on tape so

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.169 
and I've got the whole thing on tape so
I've<00:00:12.360> put<00:00:12.599> together<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.019> series<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.530> videos

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
I've put together a series of videos

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.860 
I've put together a series of videos
that<00:00:15.179> takes<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.540> through<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.839> entire

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
that takes you through the entire

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.830 
that takes you through the entire
process<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:17.070> snow<00:00:17.640> board<00:00:17.880> construction<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
process of snow board construction and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
process of snow board construction and
I've<00:00:19.500> made<00:00:19.680> these<00:00:19.830> videos<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.609> anyone<00:00:20.970> who's

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I've made these videos for anyone who's

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630 
I've made these videos for anyone who's
interested<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:22.289> building<00:00:22.650> their<00:00:23.100> own<00:00:23.130> snow

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
interested in building their own snow

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.099 
interested in building their own snow
board<00:00:24.170> in<00:00:25.170> their<00:00:25.350> basement<00:00:25.769> or<00:00:25.859> garage<00:00:26.090> so

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
board in their basement or garage so

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.839 
board in their basement or garage so
there<00:00:28.109> are<00:00:28.230> two<00:00:28.410> assumptions<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.279> are

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
there are two assumptions that are

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.250 
there are two assumptions that are
behind<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> videos<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> first<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.140> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
behind the videos the first is that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
behind the videos the first is that
there's<00:00:31.500> no<00:00:31.619> access<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> pneumatic

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
there's no access to a pneumatic

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.959 
there's no access to a pneumatic
snowboard<00:00:33.660> cross<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.920> second<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
snowboard cross and the second is that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.280 
snowboard cross and the second is that
there<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.270> an<00:00:36.390> access<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.680> expensive<00:00:38.550> CAD

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
there is an access to an expensive CAD

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.410 
there is an access to an expensive CAD
computer-aided<00:00:40.290> design<00:00:40.710> software<00:00:41.610> program

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
computer-aided design software program

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.360 
computer-aided design software program
so<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:44.690> series<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.840> videos<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
so this series of videos use this

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.029 
so this series of videos use this
standard<00:00:47.969> tool<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.750> you'll<00:00:49.289> find<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
standard tool that you'll find in a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.490 
standard tool that you'll find in a
garage<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.449> you're<00:00:51.600> doing<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.960> project

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
garage and if you're doing this project

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.900 
garage and if you're doing this project
maybe<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.190> friends<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.610> should<00:00:53.789> be

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
maybe with some friends it should be

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.119 
maybe with some friends it should be
really<00:00:54.210> easy<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> tools<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
really easy to get all the tools that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
really easy to get all the tools that
you<00:00:56.460> need<00:00:56.489> together<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> snowboard

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you need together to make a snowboard

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.880 
you need together to make a snowboard
