00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.559 
actually going to zoom in a little bit
more<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.229> I<00:01:51.289> can<00:01:51.439> get<00:01:51.560> some<00:01:51.740> more<00:01:51.889> detail

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
more so I can get some more detail

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.859 
more so I can get some more detail
moving<00:01:53.569> down<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:54.109> mode<00:01:54.350> I'll<00:01:54.679> say<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.130> 16<00:01:55.869> all

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
moving down to mode I'll say the 16 all

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.370 
moving down to mode I'll say the 16 all
right<00:01:57.069> so<00:01:58.069> here<00:01:58.609> you<00:01:59.420> can<00:01:59.569> actually<00:01:59.749> see<00:02:00.170> the

right so here you can actually see the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.739 
right so here you can actually see the
pretty<00:02:00.619> clear<00:02:00.889> satellite<00:02:01.340> imagery<00:02:01.819> of<00:02:01.939> the

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
pretty clear satellite imagery of the

Dieppe<00:02:03.200> traffic<00:02:03.649> circle<00:02:03.979> within<00:02:04.219> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
Dieppe traffic circle within the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.219 
Dieppe traffic circle within the
province<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.759> New<00:02:04.939> excuse<00:02:05.869> me<00:02:06.020> not<00:02:06.139> the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
province of New excuse me not the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
problems to Brunswick Moncton all right

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.359 
problems to Brunswick Moncton all right
so<00:02:08.119> you've<00:02:08.569> got<00:02:08.600> pretty<00:02:08.990> clear<00:02:09.259> images<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.250> I'm

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
so you've got pretty clear images so I'm

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.559 
so you've got pretty clear images so I'm
actually<00:02:10.490> going<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.819> Jack<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.180> zoom<00:02:11.360> down<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
actually going to Jack the zoom down a

little<00:02:11.840> bit<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.550> see<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> larger

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
little bit so that I can see a larger

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.530 
little bit so that I can see a larger
area<00:02:14.650> all<00:02:15.650> right<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> want<00:02:18.110> to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
to select this particular area by using

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.210 
to select this particular area by using
my<00:02:32.730> left<00:02:33.000> mouse<00:02:33.510> button<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.049> dragging<00:02:34.980> and

my left mouse button and dragging and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.460 
my left mouse button and dragging and
zooming<00:02:36.060> out<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> selection<00:02:36.659> such<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.170> and

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
zooming out a selection such as this and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.250 
zooming out a selection such as this and
you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.189> notice<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.549> when<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> reduce<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
you can notice that when I reduce the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.289 
you can notice that when I reduce the
zoom<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.620> keeps<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.980> same<00:02:41.159> area<00:02:41.609> so<00:02:41.640> let's

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
zoom it keeps the same area so let's

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.179 
zoom it keeps the same area so let's
actually<00:02:42.480> select<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.170> larger<00:02:43.590> area<00:02:43.799> such<00:02:44.159> as

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
actually select a larger area such as

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.710 
actually select a larger area such as
this<00:02:44.540> okay

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
this okay

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.940 
this okay
and<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> see<00:02:48.450> over<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:48.719> are<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.709> zoom

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and what you see over here are the zoom

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.069 
and what you see over here are the zoom
levels<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.639> for<00:02:50.849> every<00:02:51.209> level<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:51.840> want

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
levels so for every level that you want

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.009 
levels so for every level that you want
or<00:02:52.590> every<00:02:53.099> detail<00:02:53.519> level<00:02:53.879> that<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.480> want<00:02:54.750> to

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
or every detail level that you want to

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.199 
or every detail level that you want to
have<00:02:55.260> available<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.159> your<00:02:56.310> GPS<00:02:56.669> you<00:02:56.790> need<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
have available on your GPS you need to

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.119 
have available on your GPS you need to
choose<00:02:57.419> a<00:02:57.450> zoom<00:02:57.750> level<00:02:57.959> what<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.769> have<00:02:58.980> been

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
choose a zoom level what I have been

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.780 
choose a zoom level what I have been
finding<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.139> zoom<00:03:01.139> levels<00:03:01.500> 14<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.310> 16

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
finding is that zoom levels 14 and 16

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.360 
finding is that zoom levels 14 and 16
seem<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.810> most<00:03:04.049> useful<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:05.159> those

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
seem to be the most useful of those

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.780 
seem to be the most useful of those
levels<00:03:05.700> available<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.840> simply<00:03:07.500> select

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
levels available so I simply select

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.119 
levels available so I simply select
excuse<00:03:08.790> me<00:03:08.939> those<00:03:09.150> two<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.829> down<00:03:10.829> here<00:03:11.099> I

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
excuse me those two and down here I

excuse me those two and down here I
choose<00:03:11.519> add<00:03:11.700> selection<00:03:12.419> and<00:03:13.169> in<00:03:13.260> doing<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.829> it

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
choose add selection and in doing so it

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.490 
choose add selection and in doing so it
shows<00:03:14.609> me<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.970> two<00:03:15.150> zoom<00:03:15.419> levels<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> 14<00:03:16.319> and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
shows me the two zoom levels the 14 and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.030 
shows me the two zoom levels the 14 and
the<00:03:16.680> 16<00:03:17.129> all<00:03:17.970> right<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.930> what<00:03:19.409> I<00:03:19.439> do<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.650> under
