battery<00:04:54.940> charger<00:04:55.510> itself<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:57.030> will

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
battery charger itself and will

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.930 
battery charger itself and will
externally<00:04:59.410> charge<00:04:59.980> the<00:05:00.190> battery<00:05:00.550> that's<00:05:00.730> in

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
externally charge the battery that's in

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.690 
externally charge the battery that's in
the<00:05:01.150> camera<00:05:01.960> controlled<00:05:02.380> unit<00:05:02.740> or<00:05:03.070> you<00:05:03.520> can

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
the camera controlled unit or you can

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.610 
the camera controlled unit or you can
add<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:03.910> second<00:05:04.420> battery<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.960> outside<00:05:05.380> so

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
add a second battery to the outside so

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.020 
add a second battery to the outside so
that<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:05.860> can<00:05:06.040> charge<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.550> kick<00:05:06.790> two

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
that you can charge to kick two

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.870 
that you can charge to kick two
batteries<00:05:07.420> simultaneously<00:05:08.260> in<00:05:08.920> AC<00:05:09.550> operation

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
batteries simultaneously in AC operation

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.510 
batteries simultaneously in AC operation
you<00:05:10.480> simply<00:05:10.810> have<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.020> power<00:05:11.290> switch<00:05:11.620> on<00:05:11.920> and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
you simply have a power switch on and

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.820 
you simply have a power switch on and
off<00:05:14.700> this<00:05:15.700> camera<00:05:16.180> we<00:05:16.390> think<00:05:16.750> will<00:05:17.350> sell<00:05:17.800> a

off this camera we think will sell a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.910 
off this camera we think will sell a
great<00:05:18.160> deal<00:05:19.200> essentially<00:05:20.200> because<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.770> its

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
great deal essentially because of its

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.050 
great deal essentially because of its
simplicity<00:05:21.130> and<00:05:21.670> design<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:23.290> absence<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.490> the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
two tubes makes setup quite simple and
