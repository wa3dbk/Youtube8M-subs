to<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.180> Silverstone<00:00:50.780> GP<00:00:51.320> circuit<00:00:51.830> which<00:00:51.980> I

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
to the Silverstone GP circuit which I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.619 
to the Silverstone GP circuit which I
know<00:00:52.250> very<00:00:52.489> well<00:00:54.070> so<00:00:55.070> really<00:00:55.309> is<00:00:55.519> at<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.330> IRS

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
know very well so really is at the IRS

know very well so really is at the IRS
I'm<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:56.960> learn<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.260> circuit<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.159> car<00:00:58.370> and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
I'm to learn the circuit and the car and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.979 
I'm to learn the circuit and the car and
the<00:00:58.670> team<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.089> it's<00:00:59.239> quite<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.420> lot<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.750> take<00:00:59.930> in

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
the team so it's quite a lot to take in

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.079 
the team so it's quite a lot to take in
initially<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.460> great<00:01:01.670> thing<00:01:01.699> about<00:01:01.940> this

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
initially so the great thing about this

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.360 
initially so the great thing about this
test<00:01:02.479> is<00:01:02.659> I<00:01:02.750> can<00:01:02.930> really<00:01:03.290> just<00:01:03.500> practice<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.220> few

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
test is I can really just practice a few

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.070 
test is I can really just practice a few
things<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.879> car<00:01:05.120> have<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.600> play<00:01:05.840> with<00:01:05.870> a

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
things in the car have a play with a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.680 
things in the car have a play with a
break-in<00:01:06.320> maybe<00:01:06.920> try<00:01:07.580> some<00:01:07.610> setup<00:01:08.240> changes<00:01:08.420> on

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
break-in maybe try some setup changes on

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.539 
break-in maybe try some setup changes on
the<00:01:08.780> car<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:09.350> can<00:01:09.440> understand<00:01:09.979> how<00:01:10.490> the

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
the car just so I can understand how the

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.550 
the car just so I can understand how the
car<00:01:10.820> adapts<00:01:11.299> in<00:01:11.390> relation<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.049> calm<00:01:12.260> used

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
car adapts in relation to the calm used

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.810 
car adapts in relation to the calm used
to<00:01:12.680> drive<00:01:12.920> rings<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.340> going<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.549> be<00:01:13.610> quite<00:01:13.729> a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
to drive rings is going to be quite a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
to drive rings is going to be quite a
bit<00:01:13.970> different<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.450> radical

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620 

the<00:01:19.770> first<00:01:20.040> Ross<00:01:20.490> must<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> visit<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the first Ross must make a visit to the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
the first Ross must make a visit to the
United<00:01:22.110> autosports<00:01:22.680> factory<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.250> Leeds<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.909> a

a<00:01:36.259> lot<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.380> G<00:01:36.619> load<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.039> classes<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:37.819> very

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
a lot of G load on the classes it's very

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.450 
a lot of G load on the classes it's very
important<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.569> be<00:01:38.780> stable<00:01:39.229> in<00:01:39.469> the<00:01:39.530> car<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:40.189> to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
important to be stable in the car and to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.249 
important to be stable in the car and to
be<00:01:40.609> very<00:01:40.640> comfortable<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.140> main

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
be very comfortable so the main

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.319 
be very comfortable so the main
objective<00:01:42.409> today<00:01:42.920> was<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.640> make<00:01:43.819> myself<00:01:43.969> a

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
objective today was to make myself a

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.260 
objective today was to make myself a
seat<00:01:44.539> insert<00:01:45.020> using<00:01:45.860> two-part<00:01:46.610> foam<00:01:46.880> which<00:01:47.119> is

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
seat insert using two-part foam which is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.149 
seat insert using two-part foam which is
an<00:01:47.360> expanding<00:01:48.319> foam<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.679> mix<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.009> together

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
an expanding foam you mix it together

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.190 
an expanding foam you mix it together
pour<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.819> into<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.119> bag<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:50.630> then<00:01:50.990> actually

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
pour it into a bag and then actually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.949 
pour it into a bag and then actually
fields<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.219> moulds<00:01:52.819> around<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:53.270> body<00:01:53.390> if

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
fields up and moulds around your body if

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.749 
fields up and moulds around your body if
we<00:01:54.170> use<00:01:54.319> basically<00:01:54.709> a<00:01:54.829> bin<00:01:55.069> bag<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.549> seat

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
we use basically a bin bag in the seat

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.109 
we use basically a bin bag in the seat
which<00:01:56.659> is<00:01:56.689> put<00:01:57.200> behind<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.649> driver

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.339 

definitely<00:02:02.119> asteroids<00:02:02.630> are<00:02:02.720> crossed<00:02:03.049> because

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
definitely asteroids are crossed because

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.440 
definitely asteroids are crossed because
if<00:02:03.739> he's<00:02:03.920> got<00:02:04.130> his<00:02:04.280> usual<00:02:04.880> clothes<00:02:05.239> on

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
if he's got his usual clothes on

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.969 
if he's got his usual clothes on
anything<00:02:05.780> could<00:02:06.049> happen<00:02:06.289> he<00:02:06.409> could<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.590> be<00:02:06.709> belt

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
anything could happen he could I be belt

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.680 
anything could happen he could I be belt
off<00:02:07.219> to<00:02:07.369> one<00:02:07.489> side<00:02:07.520> he<00:02:08.299> needs<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.569> be

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
off to one side he needs to be

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.360 
off to one side he needs to be
comfortable<00:02:09.019> in<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.410> situation

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.310 

what<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.550> quite<00:02:18.760> important<00:02:19.270> for<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.720> 24<00:02:20.170> hour

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
what is quite important for the 24 hour

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.900 
what is quite important for the 24 hour
race<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.890> comfortable<00:02:21.280> with<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.700> that
