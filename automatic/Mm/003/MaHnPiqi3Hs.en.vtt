00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.200
 hi guys alright green the world gent 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.450
 3d hearts in super easy 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.450
 If you want to learn well with me? 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 the first thing they will learn 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.840
 if you need a brush array of motes 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.420
 contrast and a process like neighborhood 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.050
 I chose this rose as the base 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.050
 clear 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.390
 then I apply in the brush let the enamel 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.390
 purple 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.670
 it looks like it gives a contrast and easy 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.070
 on every night 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.070
 now I come with stronger rose 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.870
 and apply in the opposite direction to purple 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 shelter also about purple and I'll do 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.740
 our layers from side to side 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.190
 then just cover with the first one 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.190
 ready 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.100
 It's also difficult, this blue with roger. 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.150
 can inspire the next line as well 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.220
 using as base this pink mote and that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.220
 You'll have to do it three lines. 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.110
 with darker enamel you can use the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.180
 colors they want 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.770
 and they just come calling from one side to the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.770
 another with a toothpick 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.909
 the state stays like this when you pass the extra 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.240
 It looks beautiful, looks like that technique. 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.250
 of water knows and the tip is to make 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.250
 fine if you can not do everything right 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.160
 and here it is likely that I come is none 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.790
 in the face and even showed so many dreams 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.790
 for you 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.360
 and this is a recent photo the next 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.080
 to the helm and eddy and rock that he remembered 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.350
 much the galaxy climate and usually do is 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.390
 try is not one color 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 it's half the other 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.019
 and come in circular motions with 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.349
 toothpick and he already does the gradient 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.030
 alone it looks very beautiful it looks like it gave 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.890
 the biggest work to do 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.340
 so that's it folks i follow will be 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.959
 comment here and do not forget that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.709
