determined person would have given up by

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.350 
determined person would have given up by
now<00:05:50.830> considering<00:05:51.490> a<00:05:51.580> horrible<00:05:52.060> amount<00:05:52.270> of

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
now considering a horrible amount of

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.300 
now considering a horrible amount of
like<00:05:52.600> here<00:05:53.020> look<00:05:53.289> I'm<00:05:53.560> pressing<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:53.979> control

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
like here look I'm pressing the control

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:06.140 
like here look I'm pressing the control
stick<00:05:54.490> now<00:05:55.380> now<00:05:58.229> you<00:05:59.229> can<00:05:59.410> hear<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.740> right

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:21.400 

whoops

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.250 

so<00:06:22.410> by<00:06:22.680> moving<00:06:22.920> in<00:06:23.220> short<00:06:23.520> hops<00:06:23.820> in<00:06:24.090> a

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
so by moving in short hops in a

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.610 
so by moving in short hops in a
direction<00:06:25.260> I<00:06:25.620> get<00:06:25.980> to<00:06:26.130> choose<00:06:26.340> before<00:06:26.880> and

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
direction I get to choose before and

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:37.550 
direction I get to choose before and
appears<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.770> be<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:28.980> safest<00:06:29.370> way<00:06:36.350> and<00:06:37.350> of

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
appears to be the safest way and of

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.110 
appears to be the safest way and of
course<00:06:37.830> it's<00:06:38.040> going<00:06:38.070> to<00:06:38.250> horribly<00:06:38.610> screw<00:06:39.030> up

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
course it's going to horribly screw up

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:51.380 
course it's going to horribly screw up
