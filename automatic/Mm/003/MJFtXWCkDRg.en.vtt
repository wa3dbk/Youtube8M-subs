00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.220
 Congratulations on scoring our goal as 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.910
 managed the first touch 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.960
 Nights just once drove the ball to my neighbor 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.240
 help us 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.570
 Spalletti said that you would look like 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 ready to play or at least the whole boy 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 feel ready for all 90 minutes 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.350
 or the for loop needs to be played, then I 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.599
 tell you how and how you Danes today 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.090
 as far as this team is sadness which 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.380
 championship form numbers are weak at all 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.960
 such a weak team in the Champions League would 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 not yet encountered but I don't know if 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.210
 they have achieved the right part of it you can not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.920
 were much changed a lot of new things i 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.469
 I think maybe connected with this of course 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.280
 now just a team of me not 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.449
 recall a little stronger than anton korotin 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.910
 Cantonese remembers such a complete such 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.910
 teams if possible 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.879
 for several times all too weak 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.259
 frolicked achieved a turnaround result and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.659
 here I think but bend over Sanji 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.530
 It means that now I have experienced 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.020
 real shock 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 how do you think they can after all 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.340
 this news reformat command 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.970
 render worthy resistance tells me 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.570
 it's hard to say what will happen and how 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.390
 against us in any case there are very ranks 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.340
 composition and even those guys who 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.259
 will there still be there of course 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.390
 they period can be evil the other way around 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.280
 and you need to look for new teams as 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.110
 half of the project will not have until I go 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.170
 was of course they are not what is the same 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.620
 resistance we do not need is a 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.490
 same strong team to 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.530
 the form of the game will stop drinking it 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.689
 I know nothing but I am from 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.210
 newspapers find out information on either today 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.220
 scored a goal noted along with Kerzhakov 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.649
 maybe he said something he said 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.450
 I'll score right now for what it was 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.080
 will begin to predict but he also knows how 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.229
 class team as a program 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.229
 thank you and success
