00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
method will not last long it will only

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.220

and<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> reason<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.680> when<00:00:47.010> Apple

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and the reason for that is when Apple

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.220 
and the reason for that is when Apple
releases<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.610> new<00:00:47.700> iOS<00:00:48.149> version<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> previous

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
very very short amount of time and as

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.979 
very very short amount of time and as
soon<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.149> video<00:00:54.420> stops<00:00:54.690> working

is<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> absolutely<00:00:59.489> clear<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.270> before

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
is to make it absolutely clear so before

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
is to make it absolutely clear so before
you<00:01:00.570> even<00:01:00.660> try<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:02.010> sure

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you even try to do this just make sure

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
you even try to do this just make sure
again<00:01:02.550> check<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> title<00:01:03.359> video<00:01:03.600> into<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
again check in the title video into a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.060 
again check in the title video into a
below<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.260> description<00:01:04.680> make<00:01:04.830> sure<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
below in the description make sure that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
below in the description make sure that
this<00:01:05.159> method<00:01:05.369> still<00:01:06.210> works<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.810> again<00:01:06.990> as

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
this method still works because again as

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.350 
this method still works because again as
soon<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.350> Apple<00:01:07.650> stops<00:01:08.060> allowing<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
soon as Apple stops allowing you to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.450 
soon as Apple stops allowing you to
install<00:01:09.750> iOS<00:01:10.080> 8.1<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.710> method<00:01:11.010> will<00:01:11.130> no

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
install iOS 8.1 this method will no

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
install iOS 8.1 this method will no
longer<00:01:11.490> work<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> hurry<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.650> this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
longer work so when I hurry up with this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.719 
longer work so when I hurry up with this
the<00:01:13.860> only<00:01:13.920> reason<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.340> works<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the only reason that this works is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
the only reason that this works is
because<00:01:14.909> apple<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.960> released<00:01:16.110> iOS<00:01:16.560> 8.1

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
because apple just released iOS 8.1

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950 
because apple just released iOS 8.1
point<00:01:17.700> 1<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.450> first<00:01:18.659> thing<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
point 1 and the first thing that you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
point 1 and the first thing that you
want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.500> make<00:01:19.530> sure<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> your

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
want to do is make sure that all of your

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
want to do is make sure that all of your
data<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.030> synced<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.810> either<00:01:21.900> iCloud<00:01:22.530> or

data is synced up to either iCloud or
iTunes<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.509> through

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
iTunes and you can do that through

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.179 
iTunes and you can do that through
iCloud<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:25.560> into<00:01:25.680> settings<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.159> your
