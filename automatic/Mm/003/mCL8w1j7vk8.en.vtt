his<00:02:57.640> favorite<00:02:58.299> number<00:02:58.540> 45<00:02:59.080> but<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.769> were<00:02:59.860> on

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
his favorite number 45 but we were on

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.789 
his favorite number 45 but we were on
the<00:03:00.040> same<00:03:00.069> teams<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.390> he<00:03:01.959> had<00:03:02.110> seniority<00:03:02.319> he

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
the same teams so he had seniority he

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.420 
the same teams so he had seniority he
had<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.640> option<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:04.090> we're<00:03:04.360> 45<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.140> just

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
had the option that we're 45 so I just
