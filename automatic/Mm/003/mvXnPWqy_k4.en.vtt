let's<00:00:11.580> talk<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:12.030> dog<00:00:12.480> car<00:00:12.960> safety

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
let's talk about dog car safety

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.010 
let's talk about dog car safety
harnesses<00:00:14.009> these<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:15.030> good<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.570> reasons

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
harnesses these are good for two reasons

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.410 
harnesses these are good for two reasons
one<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.980> will<00:00:17.250> keep<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.580> dog<00:00:17.789> from<00:00:18.060> becoming

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
one it will keep your dog from becoming

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420 
one it will keep your dog from becoming
a<00:00:18.570> projectile<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.650> get<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> car

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
a projectile if you get into a car

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.390 
a projectile if you get into a car
accident<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.199> second<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.410> will<00:00:22.890> help<00:00:23.160> keep

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
accident and second it will help keep

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.859 
accident and second it will help keep
very<00:00:24.090> young<00:00:24.449> puppies<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.320> aggressive<00:00:26.010> dogs

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
very young puppies or aggressive dogs

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.519 
very young puppies or aggressive dogs
into<00:00:27.869> staying<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.550> place<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> car<00:00:30.529> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
into staying in one place in the car so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.020 
into staying in one place in the car so
here's<00:00:31.740> how<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.430> would<00:00:32.460> put<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
here's how we would put on the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.080 
here's how we would put on the
particular<00:00:33.390> one<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:34.320> dog

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
particular one I have for my dog

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:44.560 
particular one I have for my dog
pip<00:00:36.090> dress<00:00:36.829> over<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.100> head<00:00:41.239> one<00:00:42.239> arm<00:00:42.450> through

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
pip dress over the head one arm through

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.130 
pip dress over the head one arm through
underneath<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:47.149> then<00:00:48.149> back<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> other

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
underneath and then back up to the other

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.880 
underneath and then back up to the other
side

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
side

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
side
each<00:00:50.460> harness<00:00:50.879> will<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.149> different<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
each harness will be different so you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
each harness will be different so you
can<00:00:52.050> look<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> instructions<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:53.160> yours

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
can look at the instructions for yours

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.389 
can look at the instructions for yours
and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.539> I'll<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.289> pip<00:00:55.620> jump<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.129> into

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and then I'll have a pip jump up into

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.930 
and then I'll have a pip jump up into
the<00:00:56.520> car<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.270> I'll<00:00:57.660> hook<00:00:57.989> her<00:00:58.109> up

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
the car and then I'll hook her up

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:11.690 
the car and then I'll hook her up
okay<00:00:59.940> pip<00:01:00.350> pip<00:01:01.350> car<00:01:05.900> good<00:01:06.900> car<00:01:10.520> okay

okay pip pip car good car okay

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.050 
okay pip pip car good car okay
now<00:01:11.909> I'll<00:01:12.119> connect<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.070> chain<00:01:14.070> connector<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
now I'll connect the chain connector to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.340 
now I'll connect the chain connector to
her<00:01:15.330> harness<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> quick<00:01:18.750> it's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
her harness and I have a quick it's

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.320 
her harness and I have a quick it's
called<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> quick<00:01:19.860> link<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> top<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:32.240 

there<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:28.159> now<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there you have it now this is the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.800 
there you have it now this is the
connector<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.759> came<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.680> harness

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
connector that came with the the harness

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.160 
connector that came with the the harness
as<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.619> side<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.579> part

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
as you can see on one side this part

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.429 
as you can see on one side this part
here<00:01:40.170> goes<00:01:40.350> into<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.299> standard<00:01:42.439> seatbelt

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
here goes into a standard seatbelt

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.100 
here goes into a standard seatbelt
socket<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.149> part<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:45.689> connect

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
socket and then this part would connect

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.810 
socket and then this part would connect
to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> harness<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> found<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.820> pip

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to the harness here but I found that pip

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.660 
to the harness here but I found that pip
was<00:01:54.420> escaping<00:01:54.869> from<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.799> snuck<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.520> her

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
was escaping from this I snuck up on her

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.380 
was escaping from this I snuck up on her
one<00:01:56.850> time<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> saw<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.409> she<00:01:58.740> would<00:01:59.399> bite<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
one time and saw that she would bite the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.410 
one time and saw that she would bite the
seatbelt<00:02:01.079> unit<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.890> she<00:02:02.430> would<00:02:02.579> eject<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
seatbelt unit and she would eject this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.260 
seatbelt unit and she would eject this
and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:03.960> set<00:02:04.170> herself<00:02:04.320> free<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> that's<00:02:05.909> why

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and then set herself free so that's why

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
and then set herself free so that's why
I<00:02:07.099> modified<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.310> unit<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.050> went<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
I modified the unit and went to the the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.569 
I modified the unit and went to the the
chain<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.300> saw
