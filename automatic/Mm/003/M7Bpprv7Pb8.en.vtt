877 I really really love this moose and
it<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.280> keeps<00:03:44.430> my<00:03:44.670> hair<00:03:44.910> really<00:03:45.480> conditioned

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
it just keeps my hair really conditioned

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.500 
it just keeps my hair really conditioned
it<00:03:46.440> does<00:03:46.680> go<00:03:46.860> everywhere<00:03:47.220> though<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.120> all<00:03:48.480> you

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
it does go everywhere though so all you

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.600 
it does go everywhere though so all you
just<00:03:48.810> have<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.260> go<00:03:49.650> around<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.100> face<00:03:50.340> wipe

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
just have to go around with a face wipe

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.039 
just have to go around with a face wipe
sometimes<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.180> my<00:03:51.299> head<00:03:51.510> if<00:03:51.720> I've<00:03:51.870> like

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
sometimes on my head if I've like

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.680 
sometimes on my head if I've like
splurged<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.860> somewhere<00:03:53.299> but<00:03:54.299> if<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.510> have

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
splurged it somewhere but if you have

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.390 
splurged it somewhere but if you have
gloves<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.260> would<00:03:55.500> recommend<00:03:55.799> putting<00:03:56.040> them<00:03:56.250> on

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
gloves I would recommend putting them on

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.640 
gloves I would recommend putting them on
because<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.000> as<00:03:57.269> lethal<00:03:57.930> as<00:03:58.110> hair<00:03:58.410> dye

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
because this is as lethal as hair dye

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.190 
because this is as lethal as hair dye
and<00:03:59.010> but<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.269> very<00:04:00.360> conditioning<00:04:01.049> and

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
and but it is very conditioning and

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.680 
and but it is very conditioning and
nourishing<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.830> hair<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:03.150> it's

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
nourishing for the hair and and it's

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.520 
nourishing for the hair and and it's
better<00:04:03.870> than<00:04:04.049> hair<00:04:04.230> dye<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.530> top<00:04:04.920> up<00:04:05.130> your<00:04:06.530> hair

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
better than hair dye to top up your hair

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.280 
better than hair dye to top up your hair
and<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.400> usually<00:04:08.640> keep<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.360> says<00:04:09.600> for<00:04:09.959> just<00:04:10.140> a
