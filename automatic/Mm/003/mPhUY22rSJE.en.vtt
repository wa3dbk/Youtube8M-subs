00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello guys are the news of and this is it 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.040
 the 35th installment of the best games for 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.330
 Android 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.370
 in the evening than on Monday and Saturday 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.840
 at 6 penalties already on youtube 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.019
 sorry if I haven't done these days 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.849
 video, however, I really couldn't and didn't 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.890
 I know if in the future they continue to do 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.070
 so in these up this month 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.930
 early December I think I don't know if 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.480
 I'll upload videos from us say the first 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.070
 game that exodus zombie smash that stands on the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.420
 play store from if I'm not mistaken 89 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:40.350
 cents and a pretty nice game 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.760
 from the different from the different that can be 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 that has to do with that is, yes 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.820
 entertain for an hour and something an hour 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.000
 and passes from game or maybe even the most not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.120
 I believe for an hour and go through 12 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 obviously doing all levels 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.660
 normal mode if we then unlock the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.010
 building mode that will unlock 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.680
 when we will finish all the levels e 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.719
 normal mode increases will entertain for 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.430
 over an hour 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.320
 I put for that and protected from falls 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.790
 a ok I had to say I said it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 this game words we have to take 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 the zombies and the ass because we don't have to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.100
 let them hate them because they 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.330
 but the zombies arrive towards the house 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 and I want you to do a little ho 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.439
 read that you will not do anything 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.689
 you will see that this rises again here 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.680
 in fact it got up because I didn't have it 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.060
 killed 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.619
 we obviously don't always have to stay 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 so we will find we will unlock weapons 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.220
 we will unlock unlock the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 weapons with the points we will make that we find 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.600
 here on top apologized put pause e 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.310
 above all we will find there a few times 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 they will give the zombies themselves 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.240
 etc. this is the gun and shoots 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.149
 here it will be inside that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.229
 would now show you we wait for that 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.400
 hold up a little ok look cool is 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.350
 entrusted absurdly this thing 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.000
 it would be those balls that destroy the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.720
 houses and stuff like that 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.870
 ok and this was zombie smash i remember you 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.980
 the links in the description so here one 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.360
 zombie stronger than we can not 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.530
 drag with your fingers but we have to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.990
 destroy these bonuses with that 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.530
 we will receive that we have shown now 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.330
 that of the ball that the ball is 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.400
 this is the free version then we are 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.200
 this skier and we have to draw the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.510
 track that the skier must travel 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.570
 trying to get him to take them too 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.430
 coins here I do it ok ok no 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.780
 I do it more but I did that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.020
 it only shares the first level because 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.310
 not because we don't have others now 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.840
 I don't know if there are others because of it 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.880
 I said I did the first level but 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.010
 because it is quite difficult 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.890
 I don't know who the hell manages to do the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.350
 his game is there or throwing and that that that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.150
 I did everything I am because of path 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:59.380
 I usually stop at 10 and 10 centimeters 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:02.080
 succeed'm doing but that is 9 seconds 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.120
 seconds for what not only sorry 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.709
 saw play because I failed to 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.180
 continue it too difficult for me 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.550
 then I was that with this tablet 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.580
 I won that they are yes and no escort but 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:21.760
 so we have to ok this 9 nov 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.590
 slow slopes as always eng 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.870
 description i hope this game there 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.680
 like it is one of the best games for 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.390
 android however there is no pussy like herbie 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.550
 how it's done but I can't 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.840
 absolutely playing myself 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.870
 then if you succeed then 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.360
 tell me, that is why you send a beast because 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.140
 I can't do it I can get down to 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.840
 Michael Higgins is the third game he is 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.239
 there is a fairly known game 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.920
 obviously very well known and is here 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.820
 can choose three marathon modes 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.120
 in attack it is garbage we make top theme 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.900
 what is this is our usual tetris 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.609
 models 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.799
 the most vivid thing you see is a circle 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.260
 fund for which the cylinder is a ecologo 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.410
 the cylinder is very cool its own kind 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.060
 honestly it took me contending myself 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.190
 there is no game meyer that I must not raise 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.049
 every two seconds 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.310
 according to the two seconds I shot 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.680
 atrociously so absolutely so 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.410
 absurd the fucking without a logistics 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.480
 salling and instead of this mixed tronto 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.610
 pretty well maybe he hears there is the 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.889
 level zero level 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.830
 I arrived at the top level 3 which 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.930
 seems to be because it is difficult 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.030
 also this is not that we will go on 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.990
 the harder it gets the faster they go 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.230
 cubes is quite difficult though 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.669
 at the same time it is quite my son apple tree 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.169
 advice of course otherwise not 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.389
 put in this ranking 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:57.220
 ok the fourth game is breakout 2 a game 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.090
 that is played with two players is the usual 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.700
 game where we have to destroy with ok 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.770
 I lost we have to destroy with the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.630
 balls with balls the blocks e 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.190
 this game who makes more points than the two 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.750
 players who are all in this case 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.389
 and two me, but I can't 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.810
 absolutely to play with that right 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.750
 points wins what most cool pussy is 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.490
 that if I look like the navy 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.960
 green 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.250
 wait for the woman and it costs you lose if there 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.470
 ball 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.020
 anyway if the ball that type green the 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.510
 take the orange player wash line 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.180
 will become the reason why the next ones 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.210
 bricks that will take the points 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.100
 will resume the orange one not that one 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.710
 which is even if the ball had it 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.270
 generated the green one for whales 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.370
 they change color when I touch it so 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.380
 I hope you understand 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.180
 what the points go to the green not 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.430
 orange even if the ball wins them 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.289
 orange is the fifth and last game 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.030
 and madness circle 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.030
 I highly recommend to put me 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.919
 like to share the nick video 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.900
 recommend your friends but the first ones 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.410
 two things I recommend for the simple ones 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.440
 reasons in a few words youtube not to 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:16.490
 notifications video me if you don't have a 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.199
 certain number of conventions if you do n't 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.240
 my video that will not involve 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.520
 you don't click like you don't 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.340
 share it you don't comment on youtube 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.500
 as they will be removed from the feed 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.990
 that is, you want turned to the home page of 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.550
 your youtube and then I will disappear of the 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.919
 everything even if you are subscribed to mine 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.020
 channel so I highly recommend you to 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.599
 click I like to share of 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.610
 comment on each of my videos so as to have me 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:43.120
 always so when I upload the video 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.460
 youtube that will present it 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.289
 ok i also remember facebook page e 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.940
 twitter in description and extension 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.940
 to stay up to date on videos 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.669
 then this life and this game circulates 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.199
 madness and what we must do in words 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.990
 we must take circles and 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:04.960
 three-square triangles faster 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:08.240
 possible but it's really complicated because 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.949
 because to finish level 1 dawn do 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.639
 10,000 points mer 10,000 points not 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:14.780
 I'll never manage to do it is too difficult 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.849
 but I recommend it a lot because it exists 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.690
 also a nice pastime enough 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:19.490
 cute 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.440
 I think I have to do the series of 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.000
 pastimes however vermilion is there 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.860
 liked click I like to share it 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.300
 is I remember facebook and twitter page 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.849
 sign up and click like and 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.110
 share the video is nothing 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.110
