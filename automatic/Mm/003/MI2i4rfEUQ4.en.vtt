thing<00:01:23.460> about<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.420> microphone<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:26.400> got

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
thing about this microphone is it's got

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
thing about this microphone is it's got
three<00:01:27.119> separate<00:01:27.659> compartments<00:01:28.530> three

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
three separate compartments three

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.429 
three separate compartments three
separate<00:01:29.450> basically<00:01:30.450> modules<00:01:30.960> within<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
separate basically modules within the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.499 
separate basically modules within the
microphone<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:33.090> essence<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.340> is

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
microphone so in essence it's a is

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.520 
microphone so in essence it's a is
basically<00:01:36.509> three<00:01:36.810> microphones<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:39.530> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
basically three microphones in one so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.899 
basically three microphones in one so
you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:41.040> all<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.610> different

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you can have all these different

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
you can have all these different
settings<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.200> you're<00:01:46.560> playing

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.870 
settings to use for if you're playing
music<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.090> doing<00:01:48.450> voiceovers<00:01:49.880> if

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
music or if you're doing voiceovers if

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.160 
music or if you're doing voiceovers if
you<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:52.549> doing<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.759> one-on-one<00:01:54.030> interview<00:01:54.509> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you are doing a one-on-one interview so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.230 
you are doing a one-on-one interview so
you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.590> two<00:01:55.890> people<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.549> each<00:01:56.880> side<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you can have two people on each side of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.130 
you can have two people on each side of
the<00:01:57.360> microphone<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.450> there's<00:02:00.450> switches<00:02:01.020> at

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the microphone and there's switches at

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.630 
the microphone and there's switches at
the<00:02:01.259> back<00:02:01.759> where<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.909> change<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.020> settings

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
the back where you change the settings

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.710 
the back where you change the settings
so<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.000> using<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:07.250> the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
so the one I'm using right now is the

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.809 
so the one I'm using right now is the
cardioid<00:02:10.039> but<00:02:11.039> their<00:02:11.220> stereo<00:02:11.760> there's<00:02:12.150> Omni

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
cardioid but their stereo there's Omni

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.020 
cardioid but their stereo there's Omni
directional<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.189> kind<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.489> good<00:02:15.849> if

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
directional which is kind of good if

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.459
