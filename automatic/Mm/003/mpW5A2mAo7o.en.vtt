00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
atmosphere unless they're really big so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.289 
atmosphere unless they're really big so
I<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.189> gas<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.820> gonna<00:01:45.030> come

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I don't think a gas is gonna come

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
I don't think a gas is gonna come
drifting<00:01:45.570> through<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.409> let's<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.130> worry

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
drifting through so let's not worry

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.880 
drifting through so let's not worry
about<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> major<00:01:49.350> event<00:01:49.590> on

the orbital path of faith on which I've
done<00:03:19.890> some<00:03:20.040> research<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:20.610> this<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.060> what<00:03:21.150> this

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
done some research on this and what this

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.970 
done some research on this and what this
thing<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.510> doing<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:22.080> orbiting<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> Sun<00:03:22.709> every

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
thing is doing is orbiting the Sun every

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.670 
thing is doing is orbiting the Sun every
year<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> half<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.940> with<00:03:24.720> each<00:03:24.900> pass<00:03:25.200> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
year and a half and with each pass it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.680 
year and a half and with each pass it
gets<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.980> little<00:03:26.070> more<00:03:26.280> brittle<00:03:26.790> because<00:03:27.450> it's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
gets a little more brittle because it's

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.850 
gets a little more brittle because it's
a<00:03:27.780> rock<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:30.180> falling<00:03:30.540> apart<00:03:30.870> it's

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
a rock and it's falling apart it's

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.680 
a rock and it's falling apart it's
cracking<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.550> falling<00:03:32.580> apart<00:03:33.180> that's<00:03:33.510> why

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
cracking and falling apart that's why

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.250 
cracking and falling apart that's why
this<00:03:33.750> rock<00:03:34.260> has<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> tail<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:36.930> leaving<00:03:37.080> a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
debris field and that's where we're

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.580 
debris field and that's where we're
headed<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.690> what<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> debris<00:03:40.320> field

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
headed and this is what the debris field

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.039 
headed and this is what the debris field
looks<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:40.950> right<00:03:41.310> here<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.840> hot<00:03:43.019> one

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
looks like right here and it's a hot one
