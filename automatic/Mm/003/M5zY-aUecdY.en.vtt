00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and get a varied style to the line width

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.639 
and get a varied style to the line width
and<00:00:41.850> quickly<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.750> wanted<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> point<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pressure as we can see when I render it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
pressure as we can see when I render it
there<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.309> bit<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.940> varied<00:00:51.449> width

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
width for the whole shape because I have

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
width for the whole shape because I have
all<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.510> points<00:01:03.840> selected<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.369> hit

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460

so<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.299> time<00:01:15.540> I'm<00:01:15.899> going<00:01:16.110> through<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so one of the time I'm going through and

kind of editing this and dragging them
out<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.590> making<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.040> thicker<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:21.060> render

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
out and making it thicker will render

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.969 
out and making it thicker will render
that<00:01:21.539> again<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.200> kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.680> there's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that again you can kind of see there's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.060 
that again you can kind of see there's
some<00:01:23.220> varied<00:01:24.210> width<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.659> per<00:01:25.049> line<00:01:25.289> or<00:01:26.009> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
some varied width there per line or I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.940 
some varied width there per line or I
can<00:01:26.490> select<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.909> region<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.860> in<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
can select a region here and in this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
can select a region here and in this
case<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.399> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.580> select<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.119> whole<00:01:30.270> top

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
case I'm going to select the whole top

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.399 
case I'm going to select the whole top
area<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.970> reduce<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.149> down<00:01:33.179> so<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.140> thinner

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
area and reduce it down so it's thinner

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.210 
area and reduce it down so it's thinner
at<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.619> top<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.880> come<00:01:36.149> back<00:01:36.179> and<00:01:37.220> pick

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
at the top and then come back and pick

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.649 
at the top and then come back and pick
and<00:01:38.429> some<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:39.090> down<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> bottom

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
and some of this up down at the bottom

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.570 
and some of this up down at the bottom
now<00:01:42.659> we'll<00:01:42.840> hit<00:01:42.960> render<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.500> again<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.190> now

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
now we'll hit render here again and now

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.039 
now we'll hit render here again and now
what<00:01:44.819> I've<00:01:44.909> done<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.270> I've<00:01:45.450> created<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.810> very

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
what I've done is I've created a very

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.070 
what I've done is I've created a very
very<00:01:46.649> line<00:01:46.890> width<00:01:47.130> across<00:01:47.459> this<00:01:48.450> shape<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
very line width across this shape and

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.050 
very line width across this shape and
gave<00:01:49.709> it<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.009> bit<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.490> different

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
gave it a little bit of a different

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.380 
gave it a little bit of a different
style<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.740> quick<00:01:52.950> look<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.399> changing

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
style so that's a quick look at changing

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.330 
style so that's a quick look at changing
the<00:01:54.420> line<00:01:54.659> widths<00:01:55.049> using<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> Wacom<00:01:55.740> tablet

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the line widths using the Wacom tablet

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.789 
the line widths using the Wacom tablet
with<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.420> simple<00:01:57.899> shape<00:01:58.080> that<00:01:58.289> I've<00:01:58.380> created<00:01:58.619> an

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
with a simple shape that I've created an
