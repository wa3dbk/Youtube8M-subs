 watching a video tutorial of how 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.480
 speed up our android device 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.700
 for this we are going to download this 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.400
 application we can download it from 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.050
 google play on our device or if 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.369
 we want we can do it from the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.980
 computer 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.390
 I have a video of how to do this what 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.910
 I'll leave it down in the description of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.890
 video to that tutorial or right here if 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.350
 you have the annotations activates a link 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.840
 in red color that will take you towards 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.910
 the video tutorial once you choose the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.670
 way to do it 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.650
 let's proceed to download the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.260
 program is this is called the speed 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.090
 booster is a cleaner and is the best 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.290
 all so far of all that I have 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.450
 tried 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.310
 if you want to download it from here in the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.780
 computer I will provide the link 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.420
 it will also be in the description of 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 video you're going to go to him and he's going to wait 5 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 advertising seconds 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.290
 then the download here to the jump button 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 advertising and it will redirect you to the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.990
 crumb page 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.390
 when you upload to the cloud it will appear 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.579
 a download button of this same one 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 It is here and you're going to give here weighs 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.829
 only 6 megabytes in apk point and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.490
 well let's move now to the cell 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.720
 to explain the rest of the tutorial 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.549
 well here already here we have the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.130
 downloaded application the phone we go 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.400
 to proceed to install it 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.980
 we open our files 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.930
 if we are not going a little slow is 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.400
 It hangs a little because it takes the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.510
 program is very congested the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.000
 system 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.460
 it lasts long when the program is already 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.230
 they will see the difference the program is 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.570
 this one I click 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.820
 select install packages 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.820
 and here I proceed to give him install 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.160
 is installing and now we wait 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.350
 ok I'm going to give it to open and installed 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 and now to wait 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.610
 now the program 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.840
 phone is very slow going to last 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.840
 enough to open 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.000
 ah 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.620
 and 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.620
 and 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.739
 here we are not like it already opened ok and we're going 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.110
 to select let's open the first 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.569
 20 times I give it to him many times and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.180
 now if it takes to react 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.000
 here he asks me if I want to put him in the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.240
 desk and we see here I do not know if what 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.200
 you can not go up a bit more 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.270
 this cost to us select them 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.490
 will appear as a kind of ship 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.970
 spatial to us take it down here 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.060
 the phone to optimize we were going to 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.130
 feel more fluidity using the here 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.930
 I'm starting to notice that it 's a little bit more 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.600
 fluid that before if you notice it 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.720
 it will also be detectable now and going to 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.910
 start to detect what is wrong in 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.200
 our system and them and subsequently 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.200
 we will be able to give you optimize 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.020
 will give us a score from 1 to 10 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.150
 From 1 to 100 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.910
 to tell us how badly optimized 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.550
 this lack of optimization I have 55 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.530
 points I'm going to give you to optimize and 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.920
 then start optimizing I'll leave 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.660
 to finish and ready I have here 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.840
 other options more than this is for 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.010
 clean the garbage ie the cache of 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.750
 system 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.940
 this is to accelerate games and this is 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.730
 an accelerator from here this accelerator 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.860
 and here it comes out to me that I have 11 problems of 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.890
 speed and that's why I have it under I give it 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.170
 to accelerate and I will start to feel the 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.840
 phone much faster even 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.800
 it shows when I'm using it 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.500
 example I will access 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.680
 firefox for the first time and here we 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.960
 that already loads me fast firefox is a 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.539
 an application a bit heavy for these 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.860
 devices and well this is all for 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.469
 this part 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.360
 well already this has been the whole tutorial and 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:47.979
