00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.219
 there 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 there 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.919
 dpa 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.109
 then 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.790
 Hi, I'm the star also making music and that's what he's doing so wonderfully 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.540
 heard 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.360
 is the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.150
 Lunchbox Concept Amplifier Said lifts this little 200 and asked to work 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.530
 over a six and a half should loud speaker sounds 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.600
 the transistor design a channel I built up and has one 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.269
 small 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.999
 Sound regulation that is called a malus 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.999
 Sound Euro and money 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.470
 on the back there is a played out 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.990
 a rule Baarer headphone output 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.020
 later on 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.140
 as well as one 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.510
 also be 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.730
 after Lanier spare 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.390
 heard in Innsbruck Vienna 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.320
 I have now turned up a few ideas and percent we check times 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.740
 how the whole thing sounds a bit distorted 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.360
 However, it should not be properly interlocked 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.080
 but for blues and 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.500
 slight skirt is enough 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.770
 on 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.300
 Hann 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.560
 on 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 Hann 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 Hann 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.360
 the lunch box 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.730
 This small inconspicuous and lunch box also has a lot more in it than you 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.670
 first believe 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.930
 she is certainly no egg-laying Wollmilchsau but creates the areas 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.700
 she wants to tackle Clean Crunch 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 gentle skirt 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.080
 but "very very neat" and again the possibility to connect a box 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.679
 I also have something for you 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.139
 Listen to volume-oriented guitarists 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.629
 if you now consider that on the Ambiance controller 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.419
 at the same time also one on a dresser is simulated that is the 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.370
 Sound with spatial give besides bruises also changes 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.569
 little 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.150
 I have to say that for the price of 209 80 euros here certainly nothing 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.269
 makes wrong 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.229
 what says of me ass until next time on making music b
