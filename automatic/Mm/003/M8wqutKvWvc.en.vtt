is<00:00:53.329> bigger<00:00:53.719> than<00:00:54.109> our<00:00:54.320> object

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.729 

you<00:00:58.359> can<00:00:58.600> scale<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:58.870> by<00:00:59.260> pressing<00:00:59.559> s<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.230> add

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
you can scale it by pressing s now I add

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.229

another cube

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.350 
another cube
it<00:01:05.720> should<00:01:05.960> half<00:01:06.530> approximate<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.610> same<00:01:07.909> size

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
it should half approximate the same size

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.120 
it should half approximate the same size
but<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.590> should<00:01:09.799> be<00:01:09.979> less<00:01:10.310> tall<00:01:10.759> I<00:01:11.950> switch<00:01:12.950> into

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
but it should be less tall I switch into

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.520 
but it should be less tall I switch into
wireframe<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> see<00:01:16.250> everything

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
wireframe so that I see everything

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.150 
wireframe so that I see everything
and<00:01:18.620> I<00:01:19.220> select<00:01:19.760> scale<00:01:20.420> manipulator<00:01:20.750> mode<00:01:21.530> and

chaos of our cup is already disappearing

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.990 
chaos of our cup is already disappearing
now<00:03:38.069> we<00:03:38.129> select<00:03:38.400> our<00:03:38.780> glow<00:03:39.780> object<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:41.000> we

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
now we select our glow object and we

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.890 
now we select our glow object and we
also<00:03:42.180> add<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.810> modify<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> boolean

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.220 

and<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:48.310> object<00:03:48.700> will<00:03:48.909> be<00:03:49.060> our<00:03:49.330> cup<00:03:49.720> which<00:03:50.200> is

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
and the object will be our cup which is

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.009 
and the object will be our cup which is
called<00:03:50.620> cup<00:03:51.220> one<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:52.000> can<00:03:52.239> see<00:03:52.569> it<00:03:52.659> in<00:03:52.810> the

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
called cup one you can see it in the

called cup one you can see it in the
outliner

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.959 

the<00:03:59.920> boolean<00:04:00.280> type<00:04:00.549> should<00:04:00.939> be<00:04:01.170> difference

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
the boolean type should be difference

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.410 
the boolean type should be difference
okay

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.559 

our<00:04:07.380> glow<00:04:07.650> object<00:04:08.069> has<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.370> have<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.910> special

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
our glow object has to have a special

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.290 
our glow object has to have a special
material<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:10.590> go<00:04:10.740> into<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.250> shading<00:04:11.880> panel

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
material so we go into the shading panel

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.490 
material so we go into the shading panel
and<00:04:12.480> at<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> new<00:04:13.920> material<00:04:14.990> it<00:04:15.990> should<00:04:16.049> be

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and at a new material it should be

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.210 
and at a new material it should be
constant<00:04:17.190> white

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.220 

and<00:04:21.740> it<00:04:22.740> should<00:04:23.040> reflect<00:04:23.370> light<00:04:23.910> instead<00:04:24.840> it

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
and it should reflect light instead it

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.360 
and it should reflect light instead it
has<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.860> self<00:04:26.160> emit<00:04:26.550> value<00:04:27.060> which<00:04:27.360> has<00:04:27.390> one<00:04:28.370> now

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
has a self emit value which has one now

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.980 
has a self emit value which has one now
it<00:04:29.520> really<00:04:29.760> is<00:04:29.910> constant<00:04:30.720> white

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.969 

okay<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.669> we<00:04:37.389> change<00:04:37.780> our<00:04:38.080> background<00:04:38.350> color

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
okay and we change our background color

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.409 
okay and we change our background color
in<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:40.180> world<00:04:40.360> buttons<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:42.699> constant

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
in the world buttons to be constant

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.749
