00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
third level so I think he what he's

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.800 
third level so I think he what he's
going<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:17.790> do<00:05:18.000> is<00:05:18.150> he's<00:05:18.270> going<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.450> attack<00:05:18.510> me

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
going to do is he's going to attack me

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
and leave mana open to make it

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.300 
and leave mana open to make it
indestructible

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310
