to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.830> shimmery<00:00:29.310> highlights<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.779> great

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
to do shimmery highlights it's a great

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.790 
to do shimmery highlights it's a great
replacement<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:33.469> kind<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.770> mean

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
replacement for that the kind of I mean

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
replacement for that the kind of I mean
you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.250> theoretically<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.059> cook<00:00:36.270> your

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
you can theoretically you can cook your

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.990 
you can theoretically you can cook your
entire<00:00:36.750> face<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.649> tend<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> reserved<00:00:38.700> for

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
entire face but we tend to reserved for

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.310 
entire face but we tend to reserved for
either<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.270> highlighted<00:00:39.780> areas<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
either the highlighted areas or the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
either the highlighted areas or the
contour<00:00:40.800> areas<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.969> tend<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> use<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
contour areas but we tend to use it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
contour areas but we tend to use it
mostly<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:42.960> highlighted<00:00:43.469> areas<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
mostly for highlighted areas because of

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
mostly for highlighted areas because of
this<00:00:45.480> technique<00:00:45.930> our<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.160> heavy

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
this technique our that it's a heavy

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.000 
this technique our that it's a heavy
makeup<00:00:47.700> look<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.809> adds<00:00:49.050> lots<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.770> lots<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
makeup look and it adds lots and lots of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130 
makeup look and it adds lots and lots of
textures<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> skin<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.930> more

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
textures to the skin and the more

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
textures to the skin and the more
texture<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> add<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.190> buildup<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> add

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
texture you add the more buildup you add

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
texture you add the more buildup you add
so<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.270> example<00:00:54.840> foundation<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.039> one

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so for example foundation will be one

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
so for example foundation will be one
layer<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.610> texture<00:00:56.940> concealer<00:00:57.899> will<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
layer of texture concealer will be a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
layer of texture concealer will be a
second<00:00:58.649> layer<00:00:58.829> powder<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> third

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
second layer powder will be a third

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.329 
second layer powder will be a third
blush<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.620> bronzer<00:01:02.489> affair<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.690> with

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
blush your for bronzer affair but with

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
blush your for bronzer affair but with
baking<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:05.670> adding<00:01:06.030> an<00:01:06.210> excessive<00:01:06.780> amount

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
baking you're adding an excessive amount

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
baking you're adding an excessive amount
of<00:01:07.170> powder<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> skin<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.760> actually

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
of powder to the skin which actually

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.539 
of powder to the skin which actually
equates<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.659> probably<00:01:10.170> three<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:10.530> four<00:01:10.710> extra

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
equates to probably three or four extra

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
equates to probably three or four extra
levels<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.119> makeup<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.570> top<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
levels of makeup on top of that so it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.080 
levels of makeup on top of that so it
goes<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> really<00:01:14.159> heavy<00:01:14.430> looks<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.939> need

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
goes for a really heavy looks you need

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.270 
goes for a really heavy looks you need
to<00:01:15.210> bear<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.659> mind<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.439> women<00:01:16.830> over<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to bear that in mind for women over a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.800 
to bear that in mind for women over a
certain<00:01:17.520> age<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:18.000> those<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.540> with

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
certain age or those of you with

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.160 
certain age or those of you with

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
wrinkles or any issues you know

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
wrinkles or any issues you know
especially<00:01:22.710> under<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> eyes<00:01:23.159> may<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
especially under the eyes may not be the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
especially under the eyes may not be the
best<00:01:24.390> technique<00:01:24.869> however<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.770> need<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> stay

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
best technique however I need to stay

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.420 
best technique however I need to stay
again<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.509> does<00:01:27.720> photograph<00:01:28.380> well<00:01:28.650> so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
again it really does photograph well so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.550 
again it really does photograph well so
let's<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.540> into<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.470> what

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
let's just get into it you can see what

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
let's just get into it you can see what
I<00:01:31.619> mean<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.490> those<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.820> who<00:01:32.909> are

click on it and all open into a new

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.550 
click on it and all open into a new
window<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.970> difference<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.200> buffing

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
window the difference with the buffing

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.039 
window the difference with the buffing
technique<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.130> cooking<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.790> baking<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
technique and cooking or baking is that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.830 
technique and cooking or baking is that
with<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.860> technique<00:01:47.340> you're<00:01:47.759> dusting<00:01:48.600> off

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
with this technique you're dusting off

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.819 
with this technique you're dusting off
the<00:01:49.079> excess<00:01:49.380> powder

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the excess powder

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.069 
the excess powder
you're<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.430> buffing<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> skin<00:01:51.899> by

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you're not buffing it into the skin by

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
you're not buffing it into the skin by
making<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> become<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.920> part<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> skin

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
making it become a part of the skin

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.819 
making it become a part of the skin
you're<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.450> knocking<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.049> off<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.680> that's

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you're just knocking it off so that's

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.530 
you're just knocking it off so that's
the<00:01:56.100> real<00:01:56.250> difference<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.909> does<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> more

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the real difference so it does the more

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.359 
the real difference so it does the more
texture<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.320> technique<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.189> let's

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
texture with this technique so let's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.170 
texture with this technique so let's
just<00:01:59.549> get<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just get to it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
just get to it
you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.480> what<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.690> think<00:02:00.900> okay<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.770> for

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you can see what you think okay so for

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.620 
you can see what you think okay so for
this<00:02:02.160> technique<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.700> will<00:02:02.850> need<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.120> sponge

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
this technique you will need a sponge

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.470 
this technique you will need a sponge
and<00:02:04.080> some<00:02:04.590> loose<00:02:04.860> paddle<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.490> am<00:02:05.850> using<00:02:06.060> Makeup

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
and some loose paddle I am using Makeup

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.359 
and some loose paddle I am using Makeup
Forever<00:02:06.600> super<00:02:07.320> matte<00:02:07.470> loose<00:02:07.680> powder<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> I'm

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
Forever super matte loose powder and I'm

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.029 
Forever super matte loose powder and I'm
going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.610> bake<00:02:09.420> under<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> areas<00:02:10.590> where<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
going to bake under the areas where you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.220 
going to bake under the areas where you
would<00:02:11.130> normally<00:02:11.310> bake<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:13.160> highlighting<00:02:14.160> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
would normally bake for highlighting so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.440 
would normally bake for highlighting so
I'm<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.530> start<00:02:16.770> by<00:02:16.950> tapping<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.940> area

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
I'm going to start by tapping the area

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.230 
I'm going to start by tapping the area
underneath<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.440> ice<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.010> along<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.940> top<00:02:21.209> of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
underneath the ice and along the top of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.330 
underneath the ice and along the top of
the<00:02:21.390> cheekbone<00:02:24.890> because<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.040> would<00:02:26.190> be<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the cheekbone because this would be a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.810 
the cheekbone because this would be a
sanded<00:02:26.730> area<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.959> would<00:02:28.140> probably<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
sanded area we would probably do the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.199 
sanded area we would probably do the
center<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.750> forehead<00:02:34.730> good<00:02:35.730> point<00:02:36.030> to

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
center of the forehead good point to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.970 
center of the forehead good point to
kind<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.630> have<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.900> mind<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:37.500> wear

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
kind of have in mind is don't wear

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.650 
kind of have in mind is don't wear
anything<00:02:38.130> black<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.880> you're<00:02:39.060> doing<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.390> or

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
anything black and you're doing this or

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.720 
anything black and you're doing this or
you're<00:02:39.780> closing<00:02:40.050> you're<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.470> adding<00:02:40.739> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you're closing you're going adding you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.560 
you're closing you're going adding you
could<00:02:41.970> also<00:02:42.270> highlight<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.770> underneath<00:02:44.570> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
could also highlight just underneath the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.660 
could also highlight just underneath the
cheekbone<00:02:46.170> area<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.950> would<00:02:47.220> give<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> real

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
cheekbone area this would give a real

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.370 
cheekbone area this would give a real
sharp<00:02:48.120> defined<00:02:48.720> look<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> jaw<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:51.260> or<00:02:52.260> to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
sharp defined look to the jaw and or to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.150 
sharp defined look to the jaw and or to
the<00:02:52.470> cheekbone<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.459> would<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.360> do

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
the cheekbone and you would kind of do

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.460 
the cheekbone and you would kind of do
the<00:02:56.160> bridge<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.330> nose<00:02:57.360> as<00:02:57.660> well<00:02:57.690> now

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
the bridge of the nose as well now

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.229 
the bridge of the nose as well now
generally<00:02:59.010> speaking<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.640> would<00:02:59.790> then<00:02:59.910> leave

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
generally speaking you would then leave

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.199 
generally speaking you would then leave
that<00:03:00.510> for<00:03:00.959> an<00:03:01.320> extended<00:03:02.010> amount<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.459> time<00:03:02.520> to

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
that for an extended amount of time to

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.690 
that for an extended amount of time to
allow<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.720> sit<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.650> skin<00:03:04.890> how<00:03:05.430> long<00:03:05.580> you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
allow it to sit on the skin how long you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.699 
allow it to sit on the skin how long you
leave<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.269> really<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.530> could

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
leave it is really up to you you could

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.990 
leave it is really up to you you could
then<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:08.010> into<00:03:08.130> your<00:03:08.340> eye<00:03:08.370> shadow<00:03:08.640> because

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
then go into your eye shadow because

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.940 
then go into your eye shadow because
chances<00:03:09.450> are<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.049> darker<00:03:10.440> colors<00:03:10.709> are<00:03:10.830> on<00:03:10.920> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
chances are the darker colors are on the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.979 
chances are the darker colors are on the
outside<00:03:11.310> area<00:03:11.730> they're<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.390> fall<00:03:12.660> onto

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
outside area they're going to fall onto

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.960 
outside area they're going to fall onto
this<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.739> brush<00:03:13.920> them<00:03:14.130> away<00:03:14.250> but

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
this you can brush them away but

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.520 
this you can brush them away but
technically<00:03:15.480> speaking<00:03:15.570> leave<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.470> at

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
technically speaking leave it for at

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.320 
technically speaking leave it for at
least<00:03:16.620> three<00:03:16.950> minutes<00:03:17.250> preferably<00:03:17.820> ten<00:03:18.060> just

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
the technique it is entirely up to you

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.540 
the technique it is entirely up to you
whether<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.470> use<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.040> pros<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.490> cons

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
are there it really is just another way

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.800

of<00:04:37.920> setting<00:04:38.430> your<00:04:38.520> makeup<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.330> unlike<00:04:39.720> the

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
buffing technique there is more chance

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.540 
buffing technique there is more chance
of<00:04:42.570> texture<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.440> skin<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:43.980> this<00:04:44.190> because

of texture on the skin with this because

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.090 
of texture on the skin with this because
you're<00:04:44.730> not<00:04:44.940> really<00:04:45.720> kind<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.080> grinding<00:04:46.860> into

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
you're not really kind of grinding into

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.210 
you're not really kind of grinding into
the<00:04:47.310> skin<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:48.060> way<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.270> are<00:04:48.630> with<00:04:49.220> the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
the skin the way you are with the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.680 
the skin the way you are with the
buffing<00:04:50.550> technique<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.180> can<00:04:51.270> also<00:04:51.420> use<00:04:51.660> a

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
buffing technique you can also use a

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.390 
buffing technique you can also use a
setting<00:04:52.050> spray<00:04:52.080> over<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.010> that<00:04:53.190> will

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
setting spray over this and that will

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.030 
setting spray over this and that will
take<00:04:53.550> away<00:04:53.760> some<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.150> powdery<00:04:54.540> edge

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
take away some of the powdery edge
