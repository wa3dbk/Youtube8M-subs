00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.080 

this<00:01:36.050> is<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.620> actual<00:01:36.800> walk<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:38.600> Slidell<00:01:40.090> has

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
beer that goes to the key right there

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.860 
beer that goes to the key right there
and<00:01:51.200> that's<00:01:51.440> what<00:01:51.710> turns<00:01:53.980> to<00:01:54.980> knock<00:01:55.250> this<00:01:56.050> move

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
and that's what turns to knock this move

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:10.969 
and that's what turns to knock this move
only<00:01:59.870> these<00:02:00.230> will<00:02:00.650> be<00:02:00.770> connected

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.770 

the<00:02:11.819> gear<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.690> inside<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:14.390> small<00:02:15.390> 8

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the gear that I have inside is a small 8

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:34.420 
the gear that I have inside is a small 8
tooth<00:02:16.230> care<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:22.500> how<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.920> works<00:02:23.159> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.680 

with<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.019> with<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.230> keyhole<00:02:37.799> I<00:02:40.069> have<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.690> shaft

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
with the with the keyhole I have a shaft

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.530 
with the with the keyhole I have a shaft
connector<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.709> can't<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:45.390> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
connector so you can't I have it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.539 
connector so you can't I have it
extended<00:02:46.049> out<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.560> can't<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:46.950> reach<00:02:47.340> an

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
extended out so you can't just reach an

00:02:47.549 --> 00:03:07.250 
extended out so you can't just reach an
internet<00:02:48.060> yet<00:02:48.299> these<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.780> queue<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
internet yet these the queue and the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.599 
internet yet these the queue and the
whole<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.780> locks<00:03:10.019> go<00:03:10.440> into<00:03:10.709> these<00:03:10.859> holes<00:03:11.190> here

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
whole the locks go into these holes here

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:32.030 
whole the locks go into these holes here
and<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:21.090> that's<00:03:21.450> how<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.780> works<00:03:28.790> hope<00:03:29.790> that
