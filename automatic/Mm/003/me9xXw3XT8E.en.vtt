to depict color for the digital canvas
the<00:01:46.470> choice<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.950> Sony<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.850> digital<00:01:48.210> displays

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the choice was Sony the digital displays

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.469 
the choice was Sony the digital displays
the<00:01:48.960> Sony<00:01:49.229> Mayes<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.850> best<00:01:51.090> for

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the Sony Mayes are the best for

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.170 
the Sony Mayes are the best for
rendering<00:01:51.960> true<00:01:52.439> colors<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.189> also<00:01:53.850> showing

rendering true colors and also showing

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.149 
rendering true colors and also showing
different<00:01:54.960> hues<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.710> each<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> those

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
different hues for each one of those

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.749 
different hues for each one of those
colors<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> quality<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> colors<00:01:59.219> made<00:01:59.640> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
colors so quality of the colors made it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.930
