here I'm in my supposedly new Lego room

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.660 
here I'm in my supposedly new Lego room
I'm<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.110> want<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> show<00:00:25.440> you<00:00:25.500> guys<00:00:25.650> how<00:00:26.610> big

I'm just want to show you guys how big
this<00:00:27.030> mound<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.020> Lego<00:00:28.350> is<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.290> got<00:00:31.440> all

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
this mound of Lego is and I got all

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.200 
this mound of Lego is and I got all
kinds<00:00:31.860> of<00:00:31.890> pieces<00:00:32.129> here<00:00:32.520> most<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> those<00:00:33.059> are

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
kinds of pieces here most of those are

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.819 
kinds of pieces here most of those are
I've<00:00:33.300> been<00:00:33.420> sorted<00:00:33.870> through<00:00:34.789> like<00:00:36.289> plates<00:00:37.289> and

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
I've been sorted through like plates and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.220 
I've been sorted through like plates and
bricks<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.240> basic<00:00:39.810> stuff<00:00:39.930> I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
bricks or so this is just basic stuff I

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.010 
bricks or so this is just basic stuff I
haven't<00:00:40.440> went<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:40.890> yet<00:00:42.020> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
haven't went through it all yet so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.490 
haven't went through it all yet so
that's<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:44.750> massive<00:00:45.750> pile<00:00:46.020> leg<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.320> think

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that's the massive pile leg I think

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.780 
that's the massive pile leg I think
that's<00:00:46.650> like<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> hundred<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.670> odd

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
that's like a hundred and some odd

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.819 
that's like a hundred and some odd
pounds<00:00:48.060> of<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.540> not<00:00:49.200> sure<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.710> those

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
pounds of it not sure I don't know those

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.540 
pounds of it not sure I don't know those
millions<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.460> pieces<00:00:53.060> coming<00:00:54.060> over<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
millions of pieces coming over here I

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.460 
millions of pieces coming over here I
started<00:00:56.550> doing<00:00:56.880> some<00:00:57.120> dividing<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.960> I've

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
started doing some dividing here I've

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.900 
started doing some dividing here I've
been<00:00:58.620> doing<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.130> while<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.579> slowly

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
been doing this for a while I'm slowly

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.430 
been doing this for a while I'm slowly
doing<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.280 
doing it and you can see that I have
some<00:01:02.250> wall<00:01:02.940> elements<00:01:03.540> here<00:01:04.009> let's<00:01:05.009> see

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
some wall elements here let's see

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.090 
some wall elements here let's see
spick<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:08.570> some<00:01:09.570> greeneries<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> stuff<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
spick it's some greeneries and stuff I

here<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.520> starting<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.940> divide<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.540> out

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
here I'm starting to divide it all out

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.670 
here I'm starting to divide it all out
and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.000 
and
that's<00:02:18.010> basically<00:02:18.790> how<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.180> doing<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:20.010> I'm

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
that's basically how I'm doing that I'm

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.679 
that's basically how I'm doing that I'm
going<00:02:21.159> to<00:02:21.250> get<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> few<00:02:21.670> more<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.909> these<00:02:22.209> maybe

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
going to get a few more of these maybe

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.660 
going to get a few more of these maybe
two<00:02:23.019> more<00:02:24.180> stack<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.390> type<00:02:25.629> things<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.230> can

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
two more stack on type things so I can

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.460 
two more stack on type things so I can
