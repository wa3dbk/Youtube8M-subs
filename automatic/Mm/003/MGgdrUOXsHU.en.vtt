anything or cyberverse so I could

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.209

things are first um take a look at his
weapon<00:02:03.530> no<00:02:03.770> this<00:02:04.189> weapon<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.820> actually<00:02:05.000> pretty

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
weapon no this weapon is actually pretty

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.969 
weapon no this weapon is actually pretty
nice<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:06.469> we've<00:02:06.679> seen<00:02:06.920> it

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
nice I do like it but we've seen it

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.240 
nice I do like it but we've seen it
before<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> exact<00:02:08.630> same<00:02:08.830> molded<00:02:09.830> weapon

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
before it's the exact same molded weapon

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.030 
before it's the exact same molded weapon
that<00:02:10.640> came<00:02:10.880> with<00:02:11.090> Cliffjumper<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.260> mean<00:02:12.770> it's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that came with Cliffjumper I mean it's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
that came with Cliffjumper I mean it's
completely<00:02:13.580> identical<00:02:14.150> all<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.570> way<00:02:14.660> down

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
completely identical all the way down

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.290 
completely identical all the way down
from<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.560> color<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.730> said<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> mold

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
from the color to like I said the mold

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.880 
from the color to like I said the mold
on<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.660> which<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.350> really<00:02:18.650> kind<00:02:18.830> of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
on it which is really kind of

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.530 
on it which is really kind of
unfortunate<00:02:19.460> but<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.640> actually<00:02:19.910> really<00:02:20.120> do

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
unfortunate but I actually really do

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.400 
unfortunate but I actually really do
like<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.890> has<00:02:22.069> one

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
like this it just has one

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.080 
like this it just has one
what<00:02:22.740> kind<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.890> problem<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> can't<00:02:23.820> really

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
what kind of problem you can't really

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.510 
what kind of problem you can't really
use<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.660> how<00:02:25.170> ratchet<00:02:25.620> used<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> actual

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
use it how ratchet used it in the actual

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.280 
use it how ratchet used it in the actual
cartoon<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.720> them<00:02:27.840> store<00:02:28.140> it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
cartoon but you can have them store it

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.490 
cartoon but you can have them store it
here<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.460> roof<00:02:29.640> which<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
here on the roof which is really kind of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.440 
here on the roof which is really kind of
funny<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.430> put<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.730> here<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> side

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
funny you can put it here on the side

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.600 
funny you can put it here on the side
which<00:02:33.870> that's<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.830> loose<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.550> mean<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:37.610> don't

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
which that's really loose I mean I don't

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.610 
which that's really loose I mean I don't
think<00:02:38.820> it's<00:02:38.940> supposed<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.300> do<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:40.500> can

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
think it's supposed to do that you can

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.290 
think it's supposed to do that you can
put<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.010> side<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:43.790> maybe<00:02:44.790> that's<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
put it on this side and maybe that's the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.940 
put it on this side and maybe that's the
gimmick<00:02:45.720> here<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.650> quick<00:02:46.890> draw<00:02:48.950> I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
gimmick here you just a quick draw I

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.280 
gimmick here you just a quick draw I
guess<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.910> don't<00:02:51.210> know<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.660> there's<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
guess I don't know but there's the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.470 
guess I don't know but there's the
weapon<00:02:52.470> now<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.550> transformation<00:02:54.270> on<00:02:54.300> this

like lifeline kind of zigzag things

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.590 
like lifeline kind of zigzag things
right<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.100> there<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:11.790> not<00:03:12.090> too<00:03:12.390> bad

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
right on there but that's not too bad

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.470 
right on there but that's not too bad
but<00:03:13.200> overall<00:03:13.620> very<00:03:13.740> nice<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:15.000> terms<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.390> a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
but overall very nice in terms of a

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.540 
but overall very nice in terms of a
paint<00:03:15.720> job<00:03:15.780> rolls<00:03:16.260> really<00:03:16.740> well<00:03:16.950> not<00:03:17.520> a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
paint job rolls really well not a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.360 
paint job rolls really well not a
transform<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.720> take<00:03:18.900> these<00:03:19.110> legs<00:03:19.410> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
transform you just take these legs you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.210 
transform you just take these legs you
bend<00:03:20.640> these<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.270> rotate<00:03:21.720> these<00:03:21.900> down<00:03:22.230> now<00:03:23.160> you

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
bend these you rotate these down now you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.210 
bend these you rotate these down now you
have<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.700> bend<00:03:23.880> them<00:03:24.060> all<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.570> way<00:03:24.660> like<00:03:24.870> this

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
have to bend them all the way like this

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.500 
have to bend them all the way like this
so<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.340> does<00:03:26.490> kind<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.760> replicate<00:03:27.209> how<00:03:27.360> it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
so it does kind of replicate how it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.480 
so it does kind of replicate how it
looks<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.959> deluxe<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.890> can't<00:03:29.250> keep

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
looks in the deluxe now you can't keep

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.430 
looks in the deluxe now you can't keep
it<00:03:29.700> straight<00:03:29.730> like<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.240> but<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.110> actually

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
it straight like that but you actually

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.920 
it straight like that but you actually
take<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.740> feet<00:03:32.390> bottom<00:03:33.390> sections<00:03:33.780> here<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
take the feet bottom sections here and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.980 
take the feet bottom sections here and
they<00:03:34.110> actually<00:03:34.140> kind<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.920> fold<00:03:35.850> out<00:03:36.060> revealing

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
they actually kind of fold out revealing

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.920 
they actually kind of fold out revealing
his<00:03:37.920> feet<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.459> that's<00:03:38.730> how<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.480> legs<00:03:39.720> are

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
his feet so that's how the legs are

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.360 
his feet so that's how the legs are
supposed<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.800> kind<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.070> keep<00:03:41.190> them

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
supposed to be you kind of keep them

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.790 
supposed to be you kind of keep them
like<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.170> see<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.620> they're

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
like that and you can see that they're

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.590 
like that and you can see that they're
kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.100> angled<00:03:44.550> which<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.209> pretty<00:03:45.420> accurate

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
kind of angled which is pretty accurate

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.650 
kind of angled which is pretty accurate
looking<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.140> suppose<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.650> then<00:03:47.010> these<00:03:47.190> just

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
looking I suppose and then these just

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.590 
looking I suppose and then these just
accordion<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:49.310> just<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:51.270> here<00:03:51.510> you

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
accordion now just like so and here you

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.000 
accordion now just like so and here you
have<00:03:51.810> him<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.020> his<00:03:52.110> robot<00:03:52.410> mode<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.709> mean<00:03:52.830> it's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
have him in his robot mode I mean it's

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.440 
have him in his robot mode I mean it's
actually<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.370> really<00:03:53.790> really<00:03:54.300> simple

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
actually a really really simple

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.810 
actually a really really simple
transformation<00:03:55.230> but<00:03:55.650> again<00:03:56.010> because<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
transformation but again because of the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.520 
transformation but again because of the
way<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.209> guy's<00:03:57.420> colored<00:03:57.840> he's<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.260> whole

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
way that this guy's colored he's a whole

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.440 
way that this guy's colored he's a whole
lot<00:03:58.680> more<00:03:58.800> accurate<00:03:59.459> looking<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.270> whole

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
lot more accurate looking and a whole

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.090 
lot more accurate looking and a whole
lot<00:04:00.570> more<00:04:00.720> fun<00:04:01.020> now<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.350> do<00:04:01.590> have<00:04:01.800> this<00:04:01.890> weapon

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
lot more fun now you do have this weapon

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.470 
lot more fun now you do have this weapon
now<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.430> thing<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:02.940> was<00:04:03.120> talking<00:04:03.330> about

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
now the thing that I was talking about

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.449 
now the thing that I was talking about
which<00:04:03.750> kind<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.080> sucks<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.770> you<00:04:04.980> can't<00:04:05.220> really

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
which kind of sucks is you can't really

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.060 
which kind of sucks is you can't really
plug<00:04:05.850> it<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.390> guess<00:04:06.690> maybe<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.230> sort<00:04:07.920> of

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
plug it in I guess maybe you sort of

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.740 
plug it in I guess maybe you sort of
could<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.340> mean<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.940> have<00:04:09.120> them<00:04:09.239> hold<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
could I mean you can have them hold the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.110 
could I mean you can have them hold the
one<00:04:10.020> thing<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:11.580> can<00:04:11.670> kind<00:04:12.030> of

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
one thing like that so you can kind of

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.840 
one thing like that so you can kind of
have<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.110> guess<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.580> really

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
have it like that I guess if you really

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.210 
have it like that I guess if you really
wanted<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.900> which<00:04:16.080> isn't<00:04:16.560> too<00:04:16.890> terribly

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
wanted to that which isn't too terribly

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.010 
wanted to that which isn't too terribly
bad<00:04:17.489> but<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:17.820> think<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.299> more<00:04:18.480> designed<00:04:18.840> for

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
bad but I think it's more designed for

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.740 
bad but I think it's more designed for
them<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.410> hold<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.799> like<00:04:20.640> this<00:04:20.940> which<00:04:21.330> again

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
them to hold it like this which again

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.710 
them to hold it like this which again
isn't<00:04:21.959> too<00:04:22.260> bad<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:23.180> it's<00:04:24.180> definitely<00:04:24.419> a

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
isn't too bad but it's definitely a

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.659 
isn't too bad but it's definitely a
little<00:04:24.960> bit<00:04:25.080> higher<00:04:25.380> than<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.710> should<00:04:26.040> be<00:04:26.220> or

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
little bit higher than it should be or

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.040 
little bit higher than it should be or
you<00:04:26.820> can<00:04:26.970> have<00:04:27.150> them<00:04:27.270> hold<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.690> like<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.710> and

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
you can have them hold it like this and

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.570 
you can have them hold it like this and
use<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.080> as<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> sword<00:04:31.680> which<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.250> know<00:04:32.340> that's

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
use it as a sword which you know that's

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.480 
use it as a sword which you know that's
that's<00:04:32.820> not<00:04:33.030> too<00:04:33.240> terribly<00:04:33.600> bad<00:04:33.840> now

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
that's not too terribly bad now

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.040 
that's not too terribly bad now
the<00:04:34.580> one<00:04:34.759> kind<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.120> minor<00:04:35.389> problem<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:35.960> do

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
the one kind of minor problem that I do

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.360 
the one kind of minor problem that I do
have<00:04:36.319> with<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.590> is<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.919> way<00:04:37.039> that<00:04:37.220> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
have with this is the way that the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.580 
have with this is the way that the
shoulders<00:04:37.880> are<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.630> really<00:04:38.660> kind<00:04:39.169> of<00:04:39.229> hinders

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
shoulders are it really kind of hinders

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.110 
shoulders are it really kind of hinders
his<00:04:39.620> articulation<00:04:40.069> as<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:40.580> can<00:04:40.729> see<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.000> got

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
his articulation as you can see you got

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.450 
his articulation as you can see you got
the<00:04:41.270> little<00:04:41.389> peg<00:04:41.780> right<00:04:42.229> here<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:43.250> when<00:04:43.370> you

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
the little peg right here that when you

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.400 
the little peg right here that when you
rotate<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.030> around<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.479> gets<00:04:44.690> caught<00:04:45.050> on<00:04:45.259> the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
rotate it around it gets caught on the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.110 
rotate it around it gets caught on the
back<00:04:45.710> thing<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:46.220> have<00:04:46.729> a<00:04:46.759> hard<00:04:47.060> time

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
back thing so you have a hard time

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.749 
back thing so you have a hard time
rotating<00:04:47.960> his<00:04:48.080> arms<00:04:48.380> these<00:04:49.160> shoulder<00:04:49.550> bits

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
rotating his arms these shoulder bits

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.120 
rotating his arms these shoulder bits
just<00:04:50.120> really<00:04:50.539> kind<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:50.840> get<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.139> the<00:04:51.259> way<00:04:51.289> now

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
just really kind of get in the way now

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.950 
just really kind of get in the way now
this<00:04:52.310> side<00:04:52.550> it's<00:04:52.819> not<00:04:53.000> as<00:04:53.180> bad<00:04:53.389> because<00:04:53.780> they

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
this side it's not as bad because they

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.930 
this side it's not as bad because they
don't<00:04:54.199> have<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.620> little<00:04:54.889> wild<00:04:55.310> extra<00:04:55.729> bit

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
don't have this little wild extra bit

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.400 
don't have this little wild extra bit
that<00:04:55.970> sticks<00:04:56.270> out<00:04:56.569> you<00:04:56.780> can<00:04:56.900> kind<00:04:57.110> of<00:04:57.169> see<00:04:57.319> it

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
that sticks out you can kind of see it

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.990 
that sticks out you can kind of see it
right<00:04:57.560> there<00:04:57.590> this<00:04:58.160> side<00:04:58.340> doesn't<00:04:58.610> have<00:04:58.759> this

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
right there this side doesn't have this

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.749 
right there this side doesn't have this
so<00:04:59.210> this<00:04:59.360> one<00:04:59.599> rotates<00:05:00.169> perfectly<00:05:00.919> fine<00:05:01.160> this

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
so this one rotates perfectly fine this

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.210 
so this one rotates perfectly fine this
one<00:05:01.940> on<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.180> other<00:05:02.210> hand<00:05:02.599> it<00:05:03.319> does<00:05:03.680> but<00:05:04.039> then

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
one on the other hand it does but then

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.830 
one on the other hand it does but then
you<00:05:04.340> have<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.639> kind<00:05:04.789> of<00:05:04.940> angle<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.449> in<00:05:05.569> order<00:05:05.720> to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
you have to kind of angle it in order to

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.140 
you have to kind of angle it in order to
get<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.139> all<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.380> way<00:05:06.410> around<00:05:06.830> so<00:05:07.009> that<00:05:07.370> that

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
get it all the way around so that that

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.270 
get it all the way around so that that
kind<00:05:08.389> of<00:05:08.599> sucks<00:05:08.979> that's<00:05:09.979> a<00:05:10.099> little

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
kind of sucks that's a little

that bad oh he's drunk don't got an urge
on<00:05:38.659> nice<00:05:39.440> comparison<00:05:39.949> here<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:40.610> see<00:05:40.789> the

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
on nice comparison here you see the

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.879 
on nice comparison here you see the
deluxe<00:05:41.180> version<00:05:41.360> of<00:05:41.810> them<00:05:41.960> next<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.770> was

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
deluxe version of them next it was

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.990 
deluxe version of them next it was
little<00:05:43.039> cyberverse<00:05:43.550> version<00:05:45.580> mini-me<00:05:46.580> you

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
little cyberverse version mini-me you

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.589 
little cyberverse version mini-me you
got<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.150> big<00:05:47.389> cones

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
got a big cones

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.749 
got a big cones
I<00:05:50.599> mean<00:05:50.750> it's<00:05:51.199> ridiculously<00:05:51.979> simple<00:05:52.250> angle

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
I mean it's ridiculously simple angle

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.260 
I mean it's ridiculously simple angle
these<00:05:53.090> up<00:05:54.039> kind<00:05:55.039> of<00:05:55.070> peg<00:05:55.460> those<00:05:55.669> together<00:05:56.030> like

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
these up kind of peg those together like

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.260 
these up kind of peg those together like
so<00:05:56.509> rotate<00:05:57.469> this<00:05:57.650> around<00:05:57.830> pull<00:05:58.699> down<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:59.030> foot

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
so rotate this around pull down the foot

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.149 
so rotate this around pull down the foot
that<00:05:59.690> just<00:05:59.960> kind<00:06:00.169> of<00:06:00.259> sits<00:06:00.680> right<00:06:00.830> inside

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
that just kind of sits right inside

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.629 
that just kind of sits right inside
their<00:06:01.400> foot<00:06:02.270> down<00:06:02.590> rotate<00:06:03.590> I<00:06:03.889> mean<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:04.460> is

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
their foot down rotate I mean this is

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.610 
their foot down rotate I mean this is
actually<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:05.090> really<00:06:05.509> really<00:06:06.319> simple

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
actually a really really simple

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.439 
actually a really really simple
transformation<00:06:07.490> and<00:06:07.699> in<00:06:07.880> here<00:06:08.090> you<00:06:08.180> already

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
transformation and in here you already

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.330 
transformation and in here you already

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
simple transformation but I mean for me

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.089 
simple transformation but I mean for me
it<00:06:13.610> really<00:06:14.060> is<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.360> nice<00:06:14.870> one<00:06:15.169> it<00:06:15.590> really<00:06:15.830> does

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
it really is a nice one it really does

it really is a nice one it really does
kind<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.520> work<00:06:16.669> really<00:06:17.270> probably<00:06:17.659> say<00:06:17.810> that

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
kind of work really probably say that

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.050 
kind of work really probably say that
the<00:06:18.110> biggest<00:06:18.319> downfall<00:06:18.979> of<00:06:19.159> this<00:06:19.310> is<00:06:19.550> just<00:06:19.940> the

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
the biggest downfall of this is just the

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.459 
the biggest downfall of this is just the
transformation<00:06:20.449> it<00:06:20.780> is<00:06:20.900> a<00:06:20.930> little<00:06:21.199> bit<00:06:21.319> too

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
transformation it is a little bit too

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.620 
transformation it is a little bit too
simple<00:06:21.889> but<00:06:22.069> wow<00:06:22.400> that<00:06:22.669> is<00:06:22.849> kind<00:06:23.509> of<00:06:23.539> a
