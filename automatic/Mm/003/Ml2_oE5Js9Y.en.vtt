00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.560
 have prevailed and mixes there 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.090
 the band spent a week in the kitchen and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.689
 Lasts me from her friends length 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.399
 Preparing to prepare joy 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.890
 you do not care much at all 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.120
 that would all be as seen and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.120
 otherwise I would have fun now 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.170
 so people we start with the ingredients 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.320
 interrupted like a wise nella 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.580
 Coconut flakes from Edeka a glass of sugar 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.540
 a glass of mail 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 a liter of whipped cream twice 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.240
 to decorate and hold such 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.050
 but you do not need weapons bowls 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.300
 but you can be so right next to it 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.720
 sheet and in the bow and back paper and 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.040
 shake it on the cocoons rattle and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.690
 spread your hold well with your hand like that 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.660
 that it has such a nice surface on 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.050
 end and not so easy on it 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.210
 you can see it nicely with your hand 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 platform mum says that the best 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.119
 cocos are capsules from edeka and therefore 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.080
 So they always bought where where should 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.150
 the best grated coconut , she said 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.570
 therefore has less near buys from 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.320
 edeka so next you take one 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.070
 pot and shake one so 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.759
 glass of sugar and a glass of mail in and 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 you also shake a liter of milk 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.800
 so and next you imagine that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.620
 sift grad has one and stir the with 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 a whisk as long as it is so 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.760
 must be firm and you never should 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:31.300
 stop stirring but continuous 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.560
 just stir and about 20 minutes long so 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.670
 after ten minutes 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.780
 then add a spoonful of butter 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.280
 and stir that then again nice 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.030
 Stir, stir and stir 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 never stop 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.900
 After about 15 to 20 minutes you will notice now 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.879
 getting harder and harder too 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.379
 rotate and stir and e-mails keep 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.379
 a nice party to feel 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.569
 if you did that, then you take 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:17.050
 you see the pudding looks real and 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.550
 Also tastes pudding and shakes the 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.550
 Turn off the cocoons 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 guilty 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.030
 Next, take a spatula 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:46.650
 again and stroke the pudding nicely 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.769
 smooth and fill all surfaces and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.019
 again should be a nice again 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.690
 have even surface and it comes 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.959
 with the spatula after you put it for 45 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.450
 to 60 minutes outside and let yourself 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.340
 cool nice 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.810
 who did that and after 60 minutes 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.239
 has cooled then comes now 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.739
 comes the end 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:27.720
 So we are not finished yet 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:29.280
 something else is going on with the cream and 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.199
 Although you take whipped cream twice 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.250
 and do you stew or a peel 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:40.320
 into it and then cream twice more 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:43.010
 solid powder and once vanilla sugar so 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.720
 that it also has nice taste 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.120
 and you touch her with one like that 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.820
 Mixing rod or mix mixer no idea 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.539
 I can use these terms from 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.470
 the kitchen is not that good yet you 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.760
 know what I mean 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.910
 In any case, you are involved now 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:05.190
 his wand or mixed device until the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:08.070
 sat firm until that didas until 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.310
 the sun solid 8 can definitely 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.099
 if you have the cream ready then 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.840
 you tilt it on the pudding on it 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.789
 Now you have three layers down 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.320
 The cocoons trickle in the middle of the 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:26.460
 pudding and over the sun now 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.050
 so now comes the finish when it comes out 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.289
 has also made such a beautiful area 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.750
 with the spatula you cut now say 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.659
 I do not know what to call 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.430
 in the city of her six times through and 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.050
 then just through the middle again 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.409
 that at the end you have twelve pieces so 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.739
 have twelve slices 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:47.169
 so now you take your knife 

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:53.830
 a disc and rolls the nice one like 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:55.509
 Roll up a doner kebab and the 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.899
 then you cut through the again 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.899
 center 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.029
 there you see mom puts that again 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.649
 once through the middle and right and 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:08.889
 is left even his is to come nor her 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:11.219
 still his out and yes that turned then 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.499
 even turn around and again and then 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.360
 is the iss the 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:23.589
 is the delicious thing from all sides 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:25.889
 with coconut bedspread tja how it's done 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.889
 becomes 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:33.209
 then grabbed on to your shell or 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.209
 the plate 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:39.519
 just curl up and then go through 

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:41.939
 cut and then into the cocoons 

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.939
 Speckle 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:01.409
 and that makes all the time like you 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.479
 See, my mom has that bit with me 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.219
 pistachios adorned from the inside though 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.219
 you do not have to do you can do 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:11.810
 Of course you can also do other things 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.919
 apply 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.259
 they can also chocolate pieces 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.830
 sprinkle on top of the soli 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.830
 has desire 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:29.430
 so that was the last total 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.510
 will have 24 pieces of it and the 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.030
 can you then stop as I said with 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.580
 pistachios decorated again or 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:39.620
 other things you hold in the inner 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:42.360
 shelf then that's it 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.770
 do it after it is very easy and it 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.140
