there<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.580> Streamy<00:00:02.879> charts<00:00:03.179> so<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.720> can

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
there is Streamy charts so you can

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.190 
there is Streamy charts so you can
select<00:00:04.410> have<00:00:04.680> stream<00:00:04.950> charts<00:00:05.250> off<00:00:06.049> which<00:00:07.049> is

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
select have stream charts off which is

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.360 
select have stream charts off which is
obviously<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> floating<00:00:07.950> or<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.250> have

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
obviously the floating or you can have

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.850 
obviously the floating or you can have
it<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.450> chart<00:00:09.690> column<00:00:09.990> which<00:00:10.260> will<00:00:10.410> put<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
it in the chart column which will put it

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.289 
it in the chart column which will put it
in<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> side<00:00:11.340> here<00:00:11.610> or<00:00:12.110> you<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.559> in

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
in the side here or you can have it in

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.900 
in the side here or you can have it in
top<00:00:15.299> bottom<00:00:15.859> whatever<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.520> that's

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
top bottom whatever you like but that's

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.429 
top bottom whatever you like but that's
in<00:00:18.060> addition<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> floating<00:00:18.869> ones<00:00:19.109> as<00:00:19.260> well

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
in addition to the floating ones as well

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.920 
in addition to the floating ones as well
sort<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.800> minimize<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.490> there<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.750> can

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
sort of minimize that there so you can

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.630 
sort of minimize that there so you can
see<00:00:25.140> you've<00:00:25.410> got<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.769> chart<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> bottom

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
see you've got one chart on the bottom

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.560 
see you've got one chart on the bottom
and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.210> another<00:00:27.269> one

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and then you can have another one

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.939 
and then you can have another one
separate<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.320> change<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.830> these

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
separate and you can change all of these

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.070 
separate and you can change all of these
individually<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.510> only<00:00:30.689> other<00:00:30.810> thing<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
individually the only other thing to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
individually the only other thing to
mention<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:31.769> split<00:00:32.250> each

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
mention is you can actually split each

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.220 
mention is you can actually split each
each<00:00:32.880> window<00:00:33.450> as<00:00:33.630> well<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
each window as well so if you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.920 
each window as well so if you
right-click<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> window<00:00:35.010> down<00:00:35.190> here

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
right-click on the window down here

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.270 
right-click on the window down here
you'll<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> says<00:00:39.649> layout<00:00:40.649> add<00:00:40.829> splitter

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you'll see it says layout add splitter

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
you'll see it says layout add splitter
so<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.730> add<00:00:41.820> splitter<00:00:42.500> horizontally<00:00:43.500> or

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
so I can add splitter horizontally or

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.180 
so I can add splitter horizontally or
vertically

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
vertically

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.740 
vertically
now<00:00:44.399> last<00:00:44.700> undoes<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> split<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.629> two

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
now last undoes that split that into two

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020 
now last undoes that split that into two
different<00:00:46.140> graphs<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.710> you've<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.850> whole

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
different graphs so you've got the whole

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.959 
different graphs so you've got the whole
option<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> having<00:00:49.670> multiple<00:00:50.670> graphs

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
option here of having multiple graphs

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
option here of having multiple graphs
you<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.930> pretty<00:00:52.079> much<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> graph

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
you can have pretty much all the graph

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.869 
you can have pretty much all the graph
running<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> same<00:00:53.430> time<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> want

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
running at the same time if you want

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.119 
running at the same time if you want
obviously<00:00:54.870> probably<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> want<00:00:55.890> all

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
obviously probably not going to want all

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.450 
obviously probably not going to want all
of<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.750> but<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.260> change<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.920> add

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
of that but you can change them and add

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.900 
of that but you can change them and add
remove<00:00:59.820> whatever<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
remove whatever you like and then you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.039 
remove whatever you like and then you
can<00:01:03.059> remove<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> splitter<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
can remove the splitter or the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.600 
can remove the splitter or the
orientation<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.680> could<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.010> third<00:01:05.189> core<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
orientation that could be third core so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.859 
orientation that could be third core so
you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.150> graphs<00:01:06.420> next<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> each

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you can see what two graphs next to each

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.000 
you can see what two graphs next to each
other<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.100> vice<00:01:08.310> versa<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.650> possible

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
other and vice versa so that's possible

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.260 
other and vice versa so that's possible
that<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.430> also<00:01:11.549> possible<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.210> these

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that it's also possible in these

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
that it's also possible in these
separate<00:01:12.600> windows<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.049> well<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
separate windows as well so if we go to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.490 
separate windows as well so if we go to
our<00:01:14.070> ads<00:01:14.369> player<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.930> we've<00:01:16.259> done<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
our ads player you can see we've done it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280 
our ads player you can see we've done it
there<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.770> well<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:18.180> blows<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.900> go

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
there as well it blows up there we go

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
there as well it blows up there we go
for<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.400> shall<00:01:20.610> remove<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> split<00:01:21.240> just

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
for now I shall remove that split just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.460 
for now I shall remove that split just
we<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:21.720> through<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> graphs<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.290> more

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
we can go through the graphs one more

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.450 
we can go through the graphs one more
one<00:01:22.590> first<00:01:23.549> graph<00:01:24.860> we've<00:01:25.860> obviously<00:01:26.009> done<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
one first graph we've obviously done the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.359 
one first graph we've obviously done the
market<00:01:26.729> navigator<00:01:27.200> second<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> market

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
market navigator second so a market

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
market navigator second so a market
overview<00:01:29.579> second<00:01:30.060> graph<00:01:30.240> beta<00:01:30.509> Betfair<00:01:30.869> graph

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
overview second graph beta Betfair graph

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.179 
overview second graph beta Betfair graph
so<00:01:31.290> we're<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:32.040> fair

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so we're gonna go with a bit fair

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
so we're gonna go with a bit fair
standard<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> live<00:01:33.090> seen<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
standard now you live seen this on the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240 
standard now you live seen this on the
website<00:01:33.689> probably<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> great<00:01:35.100> thing

website probably you have a great thing
about<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.670> again<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.390> customize

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
about this is again you can customize

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.700 
about this is again you can customize
make<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:36.990> big<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> want<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
make it as big as you want so you can

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.120 
really study in detail whatever you like
I<00:01:40.079> might<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.290> nice<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.500> big<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
I might go nice and big just for the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.969 
I might go nice and big just for the
video<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> cick<00:01:43.560> win<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
video so you can see this cick win it is

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
video so you can see this cick win it is
come<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.399> since<00:01:45.090> sort<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.990> market

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
come in since sort of that the market

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.980 
come in since sort of that the market
opened<00:01:46.740> maybe<00:01:46.920> last<00:01:47.189> night<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.640> morning

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
opened maybe last night this morning

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
opened maybe last night this morning
from<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.290> free<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.829> coming<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.220> price

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
from about free and it's coming in price

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
from about free and it's coming in price
so<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> price<00:01:51.810> over<00:01:52.049> time

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so that's the price over time

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.630 
so that's the price over time
unfortunately<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.189> time<00:01:53.430> actually

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
unfortunately it's not a time actually

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090 
unfortunately it's not a time actually
so<00:01:53.909> long<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> bottom<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.439> sort<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so long the bottom there so this sort of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
so long the bottom there so this sort of
half<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.759> graph<00:01:57.000> could<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.450> been<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.990> day

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
half of this graph could have been a day

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
half of this graph could have been a day
or<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.189> overnight<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> last<00:02:00.450> sort

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
or all overnight and then the last sort

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.270 
or all overnight and then the last sort
of<00:02:01.020> five<00:02:01.290> minutes<00:02:01.560> could<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.979> been<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
of five minutes could have been the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.550 
of five minutes could have been the
other<00:02:02.310> half<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.079> it's<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> shame

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
other half so the it's a bit of a shame

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.649 
other half so the it's a bit of a shame
that<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:04.860> haven't<00:02:05.070> actually<00:02:05.219> got<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.659> time

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
that they haven't actually got a time

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.240 
that they haven't actually got a time
along<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> axis<00:02:07.259> long<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.469> put<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
along the axis long I put on there so it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440 
along the axis long I put on there so it
was<00:02:08.340> actually<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.420> over

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
was actually you know you could see over

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.870 
was actually you know you could see over
time<00:02:09.810> exactly<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.560> panned

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
time exactly how it panned

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.960 
time exactly how it panned
but<00:02:11.780> nevermind<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:12.650> we've<00:02:13.160> got<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.730> price

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
but nevermind so we've got the price

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.960 
but nevermind so we've got the price
down<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.270> side<00:02:14.950> price<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.190> runner<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
down the side price is a runner the the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.180 
down the side price is a runner the the
betting<00:02:17.450> odds<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:18.620> along<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:18.950> bottom

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
betting odds and then along the bottom

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.500 
betting odds and then along the bottom
you'll<00:02:19.400> see<00:02:19.520> these<00:02:19.580> little<00:02:19.820> gray<00:02:19.970> bars<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
you'll see these little gray bars and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.390 
you'll see these little gray bars and
they<00:02:20.630> are<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.870> traded<00:02:21.260> traded<00:02:21.860> volume<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
they are the traded traded volume in the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.530 
they are the traded traded volume in the
market<00:02:22.790> which<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:22.940> why<00:02:23.210> you've<00:02:23.330> got<00:02:23.420> your

volume<00:02:23.630> volume<00:02:24.320> over<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.220> can<00:02:25.310> see

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
volume volume over here so you can see

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.540 
volume volume over here so you can see

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
nearly nearly four thousand pounds was

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.050 
nearly nearly four thousand pounds was
actually<00:02:35.810> matched<00:02:36.020> at<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.040> price<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.730> you

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
actually matched at that price so you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.550 
actually matched at that price so you
can<00:02:38.210> see<00:02:38.390> over<00:02:38.540> time<00:02:38.870> there's<00:02:39.110> been<00:02:39.230> small

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
can see over time there's been small

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.810 
can see over time there's been small
bets<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.070> there's<00:02:40.190> going<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.400> cut<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.670> big

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.430 
bets and there's going to cut the big
ones<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:41.690> starting<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.080> pick<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.380> now

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
ones and it's starting to pick up now

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.860 
ones and it's starting to pick up now
towards<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.310> start<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.420> race

towards the start of the race

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.060

so<00:02:45.710> that's<00:02:45.890> secuence<00:02:46.930> Betfair<00:02:47.930> graph<00:02:48.230> which

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
so that's secuence Betfair graph which

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.940 
so that's secuence Betfair graph which
you<00:02:49.490> know<00:02:49.610> can<00:02:49.790> be<00:02:49.850> mildly<00:02:50.410> can<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> useful

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
you know can be mildly can be a useful

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.190 
you know can be mildly can be a useful
depends<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.730> certain<00:02:53.000> situations<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.660> always

depends in certain situations and always

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.960 
depends in certain situations and always
massively<00:02:54.710> useful<00:02:54.800> but<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:55.370> worth<00:02:55.520> worth

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
massively useful but it's worth worth

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.700 
massively useful but it's worth worth
keeping<00:02:56.120> an<00:02:56.360> eye<00:02:56.480> on<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.350> if<00:02:57.410> we<00:02:57.530> right-click

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
keeping an eye on so if we right-click

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.410 
keeping an eye on so if we right-click
on<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:58.340> we've<00:02:59.090> got<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.210> few<00:02:59.360> different

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
on that one we've got a few different

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.850 
on that one we've got a few different
options<00:02:59.810> got<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.140> auto<00:03:00.260> refresh<00:03:00.620> which

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
options got the auto refresh which

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.220 
options got the auto refresh which
you've<00:03:00.980> obviously<00:03:01.070> got<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.780> one<00:03:02.930> minute

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
you've obviously got on to one minute

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.680 
you've obviously got on to one minute
for<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.440> one<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.180> she's<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.330> bit<00:03:05.480> fair

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
for that one and that she's a bit fair

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.570 
for that one and that she's a bit fair
graph<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.110> very<00:03:06.290> slow<00:03:06.530> updating<00:03:07.190> graph<00:03:07.370> it's

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
graph is a very slow updating graph it's

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.440 
graph is a very slow updating graph it's
not<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.060> streaming<00:03:08.600> one<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:09.140> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
not like the the streaming one for the

not like the the streaming one for the
market<00:03:11.450> overview<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.710> we'll<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.220> leave<00:03:13.310> that

there<00:03:13.640> at<00:03:13.730> one<00:03:13.850> minute<00:03:13.970> doesn't<00:03:14.210> matter<00:03:14.450> too

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
there at one minute doesn't matter too

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.360 
there at one minute doesn't matter too
much<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:15.230> you've<00:03:15.440> got<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.590> top<00:03:15.710> this<00:03:16.100> chart

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
much and you've got the top this chart

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.830 
much and you've got the top this chart
is<00:03:16.520> you've<00:03:16.790> got<00:03:16.910> all<00:03:16.940> these<00:03:17.180> different<00:03:17.240> charts

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
is you've got all these different charts

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.750 
is you've got all these different charts
you<00:03:17.960> can<00:03:17.990> choose<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.770> change<00:03:19.130> this<00:03:19.340> window

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
you can choose to change this window

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.360 
you can choose to change this window
into<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:21.320> then<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.620> different<00:03:21.920> layout<00:03:22.100> as

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
into and then the different layout as

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.740 
into and then the different layout as
I've<00:03:22.550> already<00:03:22.700> said<00:03:22.910> about<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.270> splitter<00:03:23.600> if

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
I've already said about the splitter if

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.750 
I've already said about the splitter if
you<00:03:23.840> want<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.050> split<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.530> window<00:03:24.830> so<00:03:25.610> if<00:03:25.670> we

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
you want to split the window so if we

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.250 
you want to split the window so if we
change<00:03:25.910> this<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.270> bit<00:03:26.390> fair<00:03:26.600> inverse<00:03:26.960> right

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
change this to a bit fair inverse right

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.140 
change this to a bit fair inverse right
now<00:03:27.440> you'll<00:03:28.070> see<00:03:28.250> it's<00:03:28.400> pretty<00:03:28.610> similar<00:03:28.820> but

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
now you'll see it's pretty similar but

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.250 
now you'll see it's pretty similar but
it's<00:03:29.240> actually<00:03:29.510> changed<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.020> all<00:03:30.110> that's

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
it's actually changed and all that's

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.930 
it's actually changed and all that's
actually<00:03:30.530> changed<00:03:30.920> here<00:03:31.130> is<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.640> well<00:03:31.910> you

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
actually changed here is that well you

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.400 
actually changed here is that well you
can<00:03:32.090> see<00:03:32.210> it's<00:03:32.330> almost<00:03:32.420> inverted<00:03:33.050> itself

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
can see it's almost inverted itself

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.340 
can see it's almost inverted itself
average<00:03:33.740> change<00:03:34.070> back<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:35.660> see<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.930> goes<00:03:36.050> down

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
average change back you see it goes down

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.260 
average change back you see it goes down
like<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.710> with<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> little<00:03:37.190> spike<00:03:37.400> there<00:03:37.670> and

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
like that with a little spike there and

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.240 
like that with a little spike there and
then<00:03:39.110> go<00:03:39.260> back<00:03:39.410> again<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:39.860> just<00:03:40.040> come<00:03:40.160> back

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
then go back again it's just come back

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.500 
then go back again it's just come back
there<00:03:40.400> ways<00:03:40.580> little<00:03:40.940> spike<00:03:41.150> there<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.420> guys

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
there ways little spike there and guys

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.699 
there ways little spike there and guys
in<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.660> opposite<00:03:41.810> direction<00:03:41.930> what<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.560> is

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
in the opposite direction what that is

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.930 
in the opposite direction what that is
is<00:03:42.890> because<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.280> implied<00:03:43.580> chance

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
is because it's the implied chance

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.790 
is because it's the implied chance
instead<00:03:44.330> of<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.510> odds

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
instead of the odds

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.990 
instead of the odds
obviously<00:03:45.800> odds<00:03:45.980> are<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.280> reflection<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
obviously odds are a reflection of the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.730 
obviously odds are a reflection of the
implied<00:03:47.270> chance<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:47.990> sort<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.260> inversely

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
implied chance so it sort of inversely

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.190 
implied chance so it sort of inversely
proportional<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.180> actual<00:03:50.480> price<00:03:50.690> itself

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
proportional to the actual price itself

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.070 
proportional to the actual price itself
in<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> opposite<00:03:51.830> direction<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:53.780> depends

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
in the opposite direction so it depends

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
in the opposite direction so it depends
what<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.260> like<00:03:54.380> looking<00:03:54.590> at<00:03:54.709> really<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.040> be

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
what you like looking at really to be

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.320 
what you like looking at really to be
honest<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.370> usually<00:03:55.640> keep<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:55.880> as<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.120> price

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
honest I usually keep it as the price

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.810 
honest I usually keep it as the price
that's<00:03:57.110> better<00:03:57.440> fear<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:58.070> Betfair<00:03:58.400> graph<00:03:58.640> and

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
that's better fear the Betfair graph and

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.140 
that's better fear the Betfair graph and
a<00:03:58.880> bit<00:03:59.030> fairer<00:03:59.240> inverse<00:03:59.600> graph<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:01.970> might

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
a bit fairer inverse graph so you might

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.460 
a bit fairer inverse graph so you might
want<00:04:02.300> them<00:04:02.450> ones<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.780> display<00:04:03.110> with<00:04:03.290> your

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
want them ones and display with your

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.790 
want them ones and display with your
with<00:04:03.860> your<00:04:04.010> profile<00:04:04.990> next<00:04:05.990> one<00:04:06.260> we'll<00:04:06.440> look<00:04:06.470> at

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
with your profile next one we'll look at

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.600 
with your profile next one we'll look at
will<00:04:07.040> be<00:04:07.250> traded<00:04:08.060> volume<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:10.370> race

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
will be traded volume and so this race

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.190 
will be traded volume and so this race
in<00:04:10.880> particular<00:04:10.940> now<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:11.570> starting<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.930> pick<00:04:12.080> up

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
in particular now is starting to pick up

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.080 
in particular now is starting to pick up
towards<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.010> end<00:04:13.130> towards<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.730> start<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.030> the

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
towards the end towards the start of the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.940 
towards the end towards the start of the
race<00:04:14.240> so<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.020> can<00:04:15.140> see<00:04:15.320> that<00:04:15.440> money's<00:04:15.680> coming

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
race so you can see that money's coming

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.260 
race so you can see that money's coming
through<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.160> market<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:16.700> it's<00:04:16.820> just<00:04:17.000> ticking

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
through the market and it's just ticking

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.289 
through the market and it's just ticking
along<00:04:17.480> like<00:04:17.690> that

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
along like that

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.940 
along like that
each<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.570> these<00:04:20.630> bars<00:04:20.930> awfully<00:04:21.380> represents

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
each of these bars awfully represents

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.350 
each of these bars awfully represents
some<00:04:22.070> money<00:04:22.220> that's<00:04:22.400> traded<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:22.970> market

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
some money that's traded in the market

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.120 
some money that's traded in the market
and<00:04:23.479> I've<00:04:23.540> got<00:04:23.750> one

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
and I've got one

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.130 
and I've got one
out<00:04:24.340> there<00:04:24.640> so<00:04:25.090> this<00:04:25.330> figure<00:04:25.630> here<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.990> top

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
out there so this figure here in the top

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.870 
out there so this figure here in the top
left<00:04:26.350> corner<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.800> always<00:04:27.070> gonna<00:04:27.220> be<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.580> most

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
left corner is always gonna be the most

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.400 
left corner is always gonna be the most
it<00:04:28.150> actually<00:04:28.390> displayed<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.870> point<00:04:29.140> it's

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
it actually displayed on that point it's

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.160 
it actually displayed on that point it's
on<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.830> chart<00:04:30.130> in<00:04:30.250> time<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:30.850> this<00:04:31.540> this<00:04:31.960> here

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
on that chart in time so this this here

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.660 
on that chart in time so this this here
once<00:04:32.410> this<00:04:32.560> goes<00:04:32.770> off<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.070> figure<00:04:33.490> should

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
once this goes off that figure should

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.850 
once this goes off that figure should
change<00:04:33.940> because<00:04:34.120> it<00:04:34.630> won't<00:04:34.840> no<00:04:35.140> longer<00:04:35.440> be<00:04:35.620> a

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
change because it won't no longer be a

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.130 
change because it won't no longer be a
thousand<00:04:36.580> pounds<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:36.970> was<00:04:37.090> traded<00:04:37.540> on<00:04:38.080> the

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
thousand pounds that was traded on the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.440 
thousand pounds that was traded on the
graph<00:04:38.500> last<00:04:38.800> we<00:04:39.520> just<00:04:39.700> let<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:39.910> tick<00:04:40.210> off<00:04:40.330> the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
graph last we just let that tick off the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.560 
graph last we just let that tick off the
screen<00:04:44.190> typically<00:04:45.190> another<00:04:45.970> thousands<00:04:46.420> just

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
screen typically another thousands just

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.500 
screen typically another thousands just
come<00:04:46.720> into<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.020> market<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.360> we'll<00:04:49.360> probably

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
come into the market so we'll probably

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.910 
come into the market so we'll probably
see<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.810> change<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.260> second<00:04:50.620> but<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.770> can

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
see it change in a second but you can

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.200 
see it change in a second but you can
change<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.250> different<00:04:51.550> times<00:04:51.760> on<00:04:51.940> this<00:04:52.030> as

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
change the different times on this as

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.780 
change the different times on this as
well<00:04:52.360> so<00:04:52.570> much<00:04:53.230> like<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.560> other<00:04:53.790> market

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
well so much like the other market

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
well so much like the other market
overview<00:04:55.500> you've<00:04:56.500> got<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:57.010> same<00:04:57.190> options<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
overview you've got the same options the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.030 
overview you've got the same options the
only<00:04:58.840> things<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.200> are<00:04:59.350> slightly<00:04:59.530> different

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
only things that are slightly different

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.110 
only things that are slightly different
is<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.400> probably<00:05:00.640> gonna<00:05:00.730> want<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.940> change

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
is you probably gonna want to change

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.300 
is you probably gonna want to change
your<00:05:01.240> sample<00:05:01.750> right<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.530> your<00:05:02.770> chart<00:05:03.010> range

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
your sample right and your chart range

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.730 
your sample right and your chart range
so<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.330> wouldn't<00:05:04.810> only<00:05:04.990> have<00:05:05.170> it<00:05:05.260> set<00:05:05.440> like<00:05:05.590> this

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
so I wouldn't only have it set like this

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.050 
so I wouldn't only have it set like this
because<00:05:05.920> I<00:05:05.950> don't<00:05:05.980> actually<00:05:06.190> use<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.760> this

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
because I don't actually use this this

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.440 
because I don't actually use this this
window<00:05:07.270> usually<00:05:07.710> but<00:05:09.180> what<00:05:10.180> we've<00:05:10.300> actually

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
window usually but what we've actually

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.590 
window usually but what we've actually
got<00:05:10.840> here<00:05:11.140> is<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:12.490> sample<00:05:12.940> rate<00:05:13.060> set<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.330> one

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
got here is the sample rate set to one

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.930 
got here is the sample rate set to one
second<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.980> chart<00:05:15.220> range<00:05:15.430> set<00:05:15.670> to<00:05:15.820> one

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
second and the chart range set to one

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.130 
second and the chart range set to one
hundred<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.210> eighty<00:05:16.300> second<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:16.870> what<00:05:17.050> I'd

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
hundred and eighty second so what I'd

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.070 
hundred and eighty second so what I'd
normally<00:05:17.320> have<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.740> has<00:05:17.890> or<00:05:18.340> from<00:05:18.640> 0.25<00:05:19.600> for

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
normally have that has or from 0.25 for

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.530 
normally have that has or from 0.25 for
that<00:05:20.380> one<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:21.340> chart<00:05:21.640> range<00:05:22.060> at<00:05:22.330> about

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
that one and the chart range at about

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.540 
that one and the chart range at about
ten<00:05:22.810> seconds<00:05:23.260> so<00:05:23.650> it's<00:05:23.770> getting<00:05:23.950> a<00:05:23.980> lot<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.130> lot

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
ten seconds so it's getting a lot a lot

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.950 
ten seconds so it's getting a lot a lot
quicker<00:05:24.730> you<00:05:24.910> can<00:05:24.940> see<00:05:25.150> that<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.510> numbers<00:05:25.840> are

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
quicker you can see that the numbers are

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.300 
quicker you can see that the numbers are
changing<00:05:26.320> so<00:05:26.410> you<00:05:26.470> depended<00:05:26.830> on<00:05:26.890> how<00:05:27.100> big<00:05:27.280> the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
changing so you depended on how big the

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.580 
changing so you depended on how big the
bar<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:27.790> there<00:05:27.970> it's<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:28.960> little<00:05:29.110> bit<00:05:29.200> easier<00:05:29.230> to

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
bar is there it's a little bit easier to

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.710 
bar is there it's a little bit easier to
see<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.860> there<00:05:30.100> 528<00:05:31.030> obviously<00:05:31.360> being<00:05:31.510> its

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
see that there 528 obviously being its

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.790 
see that there 528 obviously being its
biggest<00:05:31.900> bar<00:05:32.350> here<00:05:34.230> okay<00:05:35.230> and<00:05:35.500> there's<00:05:35.740> a

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
biggest bar here okay and there's a

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.110 
biggest bar here okay and there's a
bigger<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.190> smaller<00:05:36.340> states<00:05:36.670> come<00:05:36.880> in<00:05:37.000> that

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
bigger and smaller states come in that

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.660 
bigger and smaller states come in that
changes<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:38.350> that's<00:05:38.860> more<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.340> a<00:05:39.400> short-term

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
changes so that's more of a short-term

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.670 
changes so that's more of a short-term
graph<00:05:40.120> traded<00:05:40.690> volume<00:05:41.050> just<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.380> see<00:05:41.530> money

graph traded volume just to see money

what's<00:05:43.330> going<00:05:43.480> on<00:05:43.720> and<00:05:44.290> things<00:05:44.770> that<00:05:44.860> are

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
what's going on and things that are

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.080 
what's going on and things that are
changing<00:05:46.530> other<00:05:47.530> than<00:05:47.740> that<00:05:47.890> that's<00:05:48.700> exactly

changing other than that that's exactly

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.310 
changing other than that that's exactly
the<00:05:49.150> same<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.420> can<00:05:49.540> save<00:05:49.810> them<00:05:49.990> all<00:05:50.140> as

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
the same you can save them all as

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.740 
the same you can save them all as
different<00:05:50.890> names<00:05:51.100> if<00:05:51.310> you<00:05:51.340> like<00:05:51.580> as<00:05:51.790> well<00:05:51.820> it's

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
different names if you like as well it's

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.300 
different names if you like as well it's
not<00:05:52.870> something<00:05:53.170> I<00:05:53.230> normally<00:05:53.350> do<00:05:54.990> next<00:05:55.990> graph

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
not something I normally do next graph

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.350 
not something I normally do next graph
well<00:05:57.310> in<00:05:57.400> fact<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.670> next<00:05:57.850> one<00:05:58.000> I'll<00:05:58.120> show<00:05:58.150> you

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
well in fact the next one I'll show you

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.880 
well in fact the next one I'll show you
will<00:05:58.600> be<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:59.050> side<00:05:59.260> bar<00:05:59.500> graph<00:05:59.710> which<00:05:59.860> is

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
will be the side bar graph which is

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.120 
will be the side bar graph which is
actually<00:06:00.340> on<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.700> ladder<00:06:01.630> itself<00:06:02.140> and<00:06:02.470> this

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
actually on the ladder itself and this

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.650 
actually on the ladder itself and this
race<00:06:03.400> is<00:06:03.430> about<00:06:03.640> to<00:06:03.760> start<00:06:04.090> in<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.240> moment<00:06:04.540> so<00:06:04.600> it

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
race is about to start in a moment so it

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.660 
race is about to start in a moment so it
may<00:06:04.780> go<00:06:04.930> suspended<00:06:05.560> but<00:06:06.160> you<00:06:06.280> can<00:06:06.400> see<00:06:06.520> these

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
may go suspended but you can see these

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.850 
may go suspended but you can see these
side<00:06:06.880> bars<00:06:07.060> here<00:06:07.330> so<00:06:07.570> these<00:06:08.350> are<00:06:08.530> very<00:06:08.680> short

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
side bars here so these are very short

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.640 
side bars here so these are very short
term<00:06:09.100> as<00:06:09.310> well<00:06:09.540> now<00:06:10.540> these<00:06:10.930> aren't<00:06:11.170> overtime

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
term as well now these aren't overtime

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.620 
term as well now these aren't overtime
these<00:06:11.890> are<00:06:12.100> each<00:06:12.340> time<00:06:12.670> a<00:06:12.700> bet<00:06:13.000> is<00:06:13.090> matched<00:06:13.330> a

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
these are each time a bet is matched a

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.900 
these are each time a bet is matched a
small<00:06:13.960> sliver<00:06:14.440> or<00:06:14.740> a<00:06:14.770> little<00:06:15.280> section<00:06:15.700> of<00:06:15.760> the

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
small sliver or a little section of the

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.970 
small sliver or a little section of the
bar<00:06:16.090> is<00:06:16.270> added<00:06:16.540> so<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.110> can<00:06:17.260> see<00:06:17.440> this<00:06:17.770> one's

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
bar is added so you can see this one's

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.500 
bar is added so you can see this one's
moving<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.340> most<00:06:18.550> probably<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:19.270> can<00:06:19.390> see

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
moving the most probably you can see

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.000 
moving the most probably you can see
each<00:06:19.630> time<00:06:19.660> it's<00:06:20.020> added<00:06:20.260> it<00:06:20.380> sort<00:06:20.530> of<00:06:20.560> pings<00:06:20.830> up

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
each time it's added it sort of pings up

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.440 
each time it's added it sort of pings up
and<00:06:21.130> down<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:21.610> get<00:06:21.730> tops<00:06:22.000> and<00:06:22.210> bottoms

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
and down and you get tops and bottoms

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
added to your to your chart so it's not

a<00:06:24.940> big<00:06:25.120> one<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:25.480> not<00:06:25.570> a<00:06:25.630> big<00:06:25.780> indicator<00:06:26.200> but

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
a big one it's not a big indicator but

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
for a second or two it's quite helpful

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.840 
for a second or two it's quite helpful
the<00:06:29.800> fact<00:06:30.010> that<00:06:30.130> you<00:06:30.190> turn<00:06:30.430> around<00:06:30.640> and<00:06:30.790> look

at it and it's actually you know dive
five<00:06:32.979> ticks<00:06:33.250> in<00:06:33.370> one<00:06:33.490> direction<00:06:33.640> if<00:06:34.390> you<00:06:34.510> look

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
five ticks in one direction if you look

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.909 
five ticks in one direction if you look
at<00:06:34.780> it<00:06:34.900> you're<00:06:35.020> like<00:06:35.140> well<00:06:35.350> I<00:06:35.560> didn't<00:06:35.770> see<00:06:35.890> that

it happened
that's<00:06:37.470> quite<00:06:37.650> helpful<00:06:37.950> one<00:06:38.220> even<00:06:38.460> though

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
that's quite helpful one even though

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.610 
that's quite helpful one even though
it's<00:06:38.700> not<00:06:38.850> so<00:06:39.000> over<00:06:39.210> a<00:06:39.390> big<00:06:39.840> chart<00:06:40.170> as<00:06:40.350> it<00:06:40.470> were

it's not so over a big chart as it were

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.820 
it's not so over a big chart as it were
and<00:06:42.140> if<00:06:43.140> we<00:06:43.290> get<00:06:43.500> back<00:06:43.650> to<00:06:45.170> our<00:06:46.170> other<00:06:46.380> charts

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.730 
and if we get back to our other charts
next<00:06:47.400> one<00:06:47.520> I'll<00:06:47.610> show<00:06:47.640> you<00:06:47.820> will<00:06:48.060> be<00:06:48.620> weight<00:06:49.620> of

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
next one I'll show you will be weight of

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.220 
next one I'll show you will be weight of
money<00:06:49.980> and<00:06:50.330> bit<00:06:51.330> of<00:06:51.390> an<00:06:51.480> older<00:06:51.690> chart<00:06:51.930> again

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
money and bit of an older chart again

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.750 
money and bit of an older chart again
I'll<00:06:52.740> share<00:06:52.950> this<00:06:53.010> one<00:06:53.220> because<00:06:53.370> it's<00:06:53.460> nearest

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
I'll share this one because it's nearest

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.850 
I'll share this one because it's nearest
of<00:06:53.820> host<00:06:54.000> time<00:06:54.240> right<00:06:54.390> now<00:06:54.540> but<00:06:55.110> what<00:06:55.620> you<00:06:55.710> can

of host time right now but what you can
see<00:06:56.040> here<00:06:56.070> is<00:06:56.550> the<00:06:56.700> different<00:06:57.000> percentages

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
see here is the different percentages

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.760 
see here is the different percentages
now<00:06:57.510> weight<00:06:57.690> of<00:06:57.780> money<00:06:57.960> we<00:06:58.140> spoke<00:06:58.380> about<00:06:58.410> in

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
now weight of money we spoke about in

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.710 
now weight of money we spoke about in
the<00:06:58.830> middle<00:06:59.040> on<00:06:59.100> the<00:06:59.130> grid<00:06:59.400> and<00:07:00.240> we<00:07:00.300> spoke<00:07:00.480> back

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
the middle on the grid and we spoke back

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.930 
the middle on the grid and we spoke back
about<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.290> top<00:07:01.440> of<00:07:01.560> the<00:07:01.620> ladders<00:07:01.950> and<00:07:02.130> it's<00:07:02.850> at

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
about the top of the ladders and it's at

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.820 
about the top of the ladders and it's at
65<00:07:03.210> percent<00:07:03.630> at<00:07:03.960> the<00:07:04.020> moment<00:07:04.380> this<00:07:04.500> this

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
65 percent at the moment this this

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.470 
65 percent at the moment this this
figure<00:07:05.610> reflects<00:07:06.000> what's<00:07:06.210> actually

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
figure reflects what's actually

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.720 
figure reflects what's actually
happening<00:07:07.050> right<00:07:07.230> now<00:07:07.290> as<00:07:08.130> it<00:07:08.310> goes<00:07:08.460> up<00:07:08.610> and

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
happening right now as it goes up and

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.200 
happening right now as it goes up and
down<00:07:08.880> so<00:07:09.830> all<00:07:10.830> it's<00:07:11.100> telling<00:07:11.370> you<00:07:11.490> is<00:07:11.520> there's

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
down so all it's telling you is there's

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.790 
down so all it's telling you is there's
more<00:07:12.480> money<00:07:12.690> on<00:07:12.900> the<00:07:13.050> lay<00:07:13.230> side<00:07:13.500> of<00:07:13.620> the<00:07:13.680> book

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
more money on the lay side of the book

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.170 
more money on the lay side of the book
being<00:07:13.980> pink<00:07:14.250> because<00:07:14.640> it's<00:07:14.820> taking<00:07:15.090> the

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
being pink because it's taking the

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.000 
being pink because it's taking the
bigger<00:07:15.330> portion<00:07:15.690> of<00:07:15.750> the<00:07:15.810> chart<00:07:16.080> there<00:07:16.800> is<00:07:16.920> the

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
bigger portion of the chart there is the

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.410 
bigger portion of the chart there is the
back<00:07:17.160> side<00:07:17.400> on<00:07:17.550> the<00:07:17.670> money<00:07:17.850> so<00:07:18.060> it<00:07:18.150> can<00:07:18.300> be

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.420 
back side on the money so it can be

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.490 
back side on the money so it can be
helpful<00:07:18.660> and<00:07:18.930> showing<00:07:19.140> you<00:07:19.200> sort<00:07:19.320> of<00:07:19.410> the

weight<00:07:19.680> of<00:07:19.710> the<00:07:19.950> money<00:07:20.190> the<00:07:20.400> direction<00:07:20.850> it's

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
weight of the money the direction it's

weight of the money the direction it's
going<00:07:21.170> or<00:07:22.170> it's<00:07:22.290> being<00:07:22.530> even<00:07:22.920> at<00:07:23.160> least<00:07:24.950> just

going or it's being even at least just
trying<00:07:26.160> to<00:07:26.220> work<00:07:26.550> out<00:07:26.760> what's<00:07:26.970> going<00:07:27.240> on

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
trying to work out what's going on

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.850 
trying to work out what's going on
relation<00:07:27.780> have<00:07:27.900> a<00:07:27.930> little<00:07:28.140> indicator<00:07:28.500> for<00:07:28.740> you

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
relation have a little indicator for you

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.190 
relation have a little indicator for you
but<00:07:29.400> the<00:07:29.760> percentage<00:07:30.150> is<00:07:30.240> update<00:07:30.600> as<00:07:30.780> it<00:07:30.960> as<00:07:31.110> it

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
but the percentage is update as it as it

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.600 
but the percentage is update as it as it
does<00:07:31.410> in<00:07:31.710> the<00:07:31.800> market<00:07:32.190> on<00:07:32.280> there<00:07:32.490> as<00:07:32.580> well

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
does in the market on there as well

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.280 
does in the market on there as well
again<00:07:33.030> that's<00:07:33.150> another<00:07:33.330> short-term<00:07:33.870> one<00:07:34.080> so

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290 
again that's another short-term one so

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.920 
again that's another short-term one so
I'd<00:07:34.440> advise<00:07:34.860> that<00:07:35.670> you<00:07:36.390> have<00:07:36.540> it<00:07:36.660> over<00:07:36.870> a

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
I'd advise that you have it over a

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.960 
I'd advise that you have it over a
shorter<00:07:37.230> range<00:07:37.440> so<00:07:37.860> sort<00:07:38.160> out<00:07:38.280> that<00:07:38.430> second

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:38.970 
shorter range so sort out that second

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.620 
shorter range so sort out that second
there<00:07:39.150> may<00:07:39.300> /<00:07:39.510> -<00:07:39.900> not<00:07:40.560> one<00:07:40.740> to<00:07:40.890> five<00:07:41.630> and

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.630 
there may / - not one to five and

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.360 
there may / - not one to five and
arranged<00:07:43.080> or<00:07:43.230> maybe<00:07:43.410> like<00:07:43.620> 20<00:07:43.890> seconds<00:07:44.280> or

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
arranged or maybe like 20 seconds or

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.310 
arranged or maybe like 20 seconds or
something<00:07:44.460> like<00:07:44.640> that<00:07:44.700> so<00:07:45.000> just<00:07:45.030> stir<00:07:45.420> baton

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:46.320 
something like that so just stir baton

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.350 
something like that so just stir baton
fairly<00:07:46.620> quickly<00:07:46.860> it<00:07:47.700> helps<00:07:48.000> you<00:07:48.090> weigh<00:07:48.240> up

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 
fairly quickly it helps you weigh up

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.980 
fairly quickly it helps you weigh up
what's<00:07:48.570> happening<00:07:48.990> in<00:07:49.140> the<00:07:49.230> moment<00:07:49.410> right<00:07:49.830> now
