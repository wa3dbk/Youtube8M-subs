and<00:00:02.539> the<00:00:03.539> answer<00:00:04.530> the<00:00:04.620> second<00:00:04.920> question<00:00:05.090> no<00:00:06.090> I

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
and the answer the second question no I

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.380 
and the answer the second question no I
I<00:00:06.590> mean<00:00:07.590> I<00:00:07.680> think<00:00:08.100> he<00:00:08.280> realized<00:00:08.940> that

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.390 
I mean I think he realized that

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.160 
I mean I think he realized that
something<00:00:09.750> needed<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.290> done<00:00:11.780> 22<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:13.050> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
something needed to be done 22 for the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.560 
something needed to be done 22 for the
for<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.650> freedom<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.760> his<00:00:14.880> people<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.510> I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
for the freedom of his people and I

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.439 
for the freedom of his people and I
think<00:00:15.720> he<00:00:16.110> saw<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.880> aligning<00:00:17.880> himself<00:00:18.060> with

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
think he saw that aligning himself with

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.050 
think he saw that aligning himself with
and<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:19.080> su<00:00:19.500> which<00:00:20.390> what<00:00:21.390> would<00:00:21.539> become<00:00:21.660> sg-1

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
and with su which what would become sg-1

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.140 
and with su which what would become sg-1
was<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.330> way<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> possibly<00:00:25.609> facilitate<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
was one way to possibly facilitate the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.170 
was one way to possibly facilitate the
freedom<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.630> his<00:00:27.720> people<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.820> think<00:00:29.820> he

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
freedom of his people so I think he

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.939 
freedom of his people so I think he
never<00:00:30.449> saw<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.050> way<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.560> he<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> he

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
never saw it that way that he that he

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.490 
never saw it that way that he that he

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
didn't kind of ache yeah and I think

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.280 
didn't kind of ache yeah and I think
that's<00:07:00.880> what<00:07:01.000> I<00:07:01.090> would<00:07:01.150> do<00:07:01.300> I<00:07:01.330> would<00:07:01.720> just<00:07:02.080> if

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
that's what I would do I would just if

that's what I would do I would just if
they<00:07:02.770> were<00:07:04.020> even<00:07:05.020> there<00:07:05.260> were<00:07:05.440> consequences<00:07:05.800> i

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
they were even there were consequences i

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.710 
they were even there were consequences i
think<00:07:06.370> that's<00:07:06.520> if<00:07:06.760> I<00:07:06.880> had<00:07:07.030> the<00:07:07.180> power<00:07:07.360> to<00:07:07.510> do

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720

anything<00:07:07.750> I<00:07:07.990> one<00:07:08.170> for<00:07:08.350> one<00:07:08.470> day<00:07:08.620> I<00:07:08.650> think<00:07:08.920> that

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
anything I one for one day I think that

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.170 
anything I one for one day I think that
would<00:07:09.160> be<00:07:09.310> it<00:07:09.400> just<00:07:09.430> make<00:07:09.700> everybody<00:07:09.970> love

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180

would be it just make everybody love
each<00:07:10.240> other<00:07:10.510> for<00:07:10.690> one<00:07:10.810> day
