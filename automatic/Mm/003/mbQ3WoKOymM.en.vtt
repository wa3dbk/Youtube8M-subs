00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.030

 across six categories 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.520
 artist and curator very selected the project is mexico is one 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 quiet category and where I can do good projects like someone says 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 I am going to do something I have the selection myself I have difficulty with it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 instead of making my self a deposit with all kinds of a special 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.050
 Education 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.910
 choose to have to do to develop the competition for me 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.490
 makes it easier I was very impressed with the project the project 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.660
 dyslexia 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.190
 because certainly by chance a lot and know people with the fright free

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.330
 Nobel Peace Prize for the winner 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.760
 for me that is not the first option but the first option is actually that 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.630
 would like it to be more known 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 and that the more the worse actually know 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.930
 and thus actually settle more that can help and if I can 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.520
 to win 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.940
