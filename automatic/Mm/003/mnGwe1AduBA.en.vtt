00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
and especially the vanilla one sometimes

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.179 
and especially the vanilla one sometimes
I'll<00:03:47.620> use<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.069> non<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.810> unflavored<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:50.199> just

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
I'll use the non the unflavored one just

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.399 
I'll use the non the unflavored one just
because<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.430> can't<00:03:51.669> drink<00:03:51.939> milk<00:03:52.239> milk<00:03:53.019> makes<00:03:53.290> me

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
because I can't drink milk milk makes me

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.170 
because I can't drink milk milk makes me
blow<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.650> out<00:03:53.829> my<00:03:54.040> ass<00:03:54.069> works<00:03:54.549> worse<00:03:54.909> than<00:03:55.090> a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
blow it out my ass works worse than a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.039 
blow it out my ass works worse than a
Starbucks<00:03:55.599> coffee<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:57.579> I'd<00:03:58.209> rather<00:03:58.479> not

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
Starbucks coffee and so I'd rather not

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.159 
Starbucks coffee and so I'd rather not
do<00:03:59.349> that<00:03:59.729> rather<00:04:00.729> not<00:04:00.970> sharp<00:04:01.359> myself<00:04:01.810> all<00:04:01.989> day

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
do that rather not sharp myself all day

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.979 
do that rather not sharp myself all day
and<00:04:02.829> so<00:04:03.250> I'll<00:04:04.180> go<00:04:04.449> with<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.599> little<00:04:04.810> bit<00:04:04.900> of

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989

and so I'll go with a little bit of
almond<00:04:05.379> milk<00:04:05.409> sometimes<00:04:06.009> I'll<00:04:06.189> buy<00:04:06.609> the
