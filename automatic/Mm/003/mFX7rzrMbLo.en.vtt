00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
and give it a really good shape to make

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.180 
and give it a really good shape to make
sure<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.050> all<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.500> color<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.980> evenly

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
sure that all of the color is evenly

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.070

dispersed<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.240> can<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:31.840> sort<00:02:32.020> of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
dispersed you can see that it's sort of

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.990 
dispersed you can see that it's sort of
a<00:02:32.260> bit<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> bit<00:02:32.770> rough<00:02:33.160> there<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.610> goes<00:02:33.790> a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
shone through it and that was what I was

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.479 
shone through it and that was what I was
trying<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.170> achieve<00:03:02.560> when<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:02.770> was<00:03:03.040> doing<00:03:03.310> this

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
trying to achieve when I was doing this

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.420 
trying to achieve when I was doing this
right<00:03:04.150> once<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.050> dry<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.770> next<00:03:05.920> thing<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
right once that is dry the next thing to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.000 
right once that is dry the next thing to
do<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.060> get<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.330> black<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.020> I've<00:03:08.709> made<00:03:08.950> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
little bit of a mess with it so I'll

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.330 
little bit of a mess with it so I'll
just<00:03:10.540> give<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:10.989> wee<00:03:11.170> clean<00:03:11.560> up<00:03:11.770> make<00:03:12.280> sure

then<00:04:23.080> screw<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.950> on<00:04:24.010> our<00:04:24.400> screw<00:04:24.820> tops<00:04:25.090> on<00:04:25.270> as

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
then screw that on our screw tops on as

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.080 
then screw that on our screw tops on as
I'm<00:04:25.600> going<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.260> then<00:04:26.889> where<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.730> one<00:04:27.910> that

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
I'm going and then where is the one that

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.290 
I'm going and then where is the one that
I<00:04:28.150> just<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.900> one<00:04:29.050> they're<00:04:29.260> all<00:04:29.500> nice<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.010> dry

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
turn that over and then just push that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.640 
turn that over and then just push that
so<00:04:33.730> that's<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.180> flat<00:04:34.690> side<00:04:35.050> that's<00:04:35.320> got<00:04:35.470> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
so that's the flat side that's got the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.860 
so that's the flat side that's got the
nail<00:04:35.860> polish<00:04:36.250> goes<00:04:36.760> down<00:04:37.060> onto<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.570> ring<00:04:37.720> and

nail polish goes down onto the ring and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.990 
nail polish goes down onto the ring and
what<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> really<00:04:38.800> really<00:04:38.980> love<00:04:39.280> about<00:04:39.400> these<00:04:39.760> is

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
what I really really love about these is

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.600 
what I really really love about these is
it<00:04:40.240> absolutely<00:04:41.050> is<00:04:41.290> just<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:41.830> magic<00:04:42.130> because

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
it absolutely is just like magic because

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.310 
it absolutely is just like magic because
each<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.120> every<00:04:43.330> one<00:04:43.540> of<00:04:43.570> them<00:04:43.810> is<00:04:43.960> going<00:04:44.200> to

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
each and every one of them is going to

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.500 
each and every one of them is going to
be<00:04:44.380> different<00:04:44.680> so<00:04:45.310> depending<00:04:45.880> on<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.210> glitter

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
that you're using it will determine as

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.400 
that you're using it will determine as
to<00:04:49.360> what<00:04:49.660> they're<00:04:49.870> doing<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.380> other
