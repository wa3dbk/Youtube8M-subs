that's gonna make the soil test seem

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.900 
that's gonna make the soil test seem
different<00:00:54.379> than<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.890> soil<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:55.309> have<00:00:55.519> what

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.510 
might want to avoid anything that's
galvanized<00:01:08.960> because<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.620> zinc<00:01:09.920> can<00:01:10.100> show<00:01:10.340> up

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
galvanized because the zinc can show up

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.090 
galvanized because the zinc can show up
on<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.820> soil<00:01:11.060> test<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.630> might<00:01:12.170> make<00:01:12.890> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
on the soil test and might make the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.560 
on the soil test and might make the
results<00:01:13.610> look<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.910> little<00:01:14.060> different<00:01:14.540> than

you've<00:01:40.820> got<00:01:40.940> about<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.180> third<00:01:41.480> of<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.660> cup

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
you've got about a third of the cup

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.810 
you've got about a third of the cup
that's<00:01:42.680> about<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.980> third<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.460> what<00:01:43.670> you're

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
that's about a third of what you're

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.210 
that's about a third of what you're
gonna<00:01:43.940> need<00:01:44.240> if<00:01:44.630> there<00:01:44.900> are<00:01:44.960> any<00:01:45.080> grass<00:01:45.800> blades

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
gonna need if there are any grass blades

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.040 
gonna need if there are any grass blades
or<00:01:46.520> organic<00:01:46.850> material<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:47.600> there<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.870> might

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
or organic material in there you might

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.900 
or organic material in there you might
just<00:01:48.200> go<00:01:48.380> in<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.680> take<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:49.040> out<00:01:49.280> because

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
just go in and take that out because

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.540 
just go in and take that out because
that<00:01:50.120> might<00:01:50.510> skew<00:01:51.230> your<00:01:51.530> organic<00:01:51.920> content

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
that might skew your organic content

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.430 
that might skew your organic content
reading<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:53.630> you've<00:01:53.780> got<00:01:53.930> about<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.140> third

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
reading so you've got about a third

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.110 
reading so you've got about a third
there<00:01:54.710> then<00:01:55.280> what<00:01:55.460> you're<00:01:55.550> gonna<00:01:55.670> want<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.000> do

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
there then what you're gonna want to do

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.090 
there then what you're gonna want to do
to<00:01:56.270> get<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.510> other<00:01:56.630> two-thirds<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.410> make<00:01:57.860> two

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
to get the other two-thirds is make two

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.400 
to get the other two-thirds is make two
other<00:01:58.400> holes<00:01:58.730> in<00:01:59.000> your<00:01:59.090> yard<00:01:59.420> far<00:02:00.080> away<00:02:00.350> from

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
other holes in your yard far away from

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.160 
other holes in your yard far away from
this<00:02:00.740> one<00:02:01.010> sort<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.820> at<00:02:02.030> equal<00:02:02.600> spacing<00:02:03.080> around

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
this one sort of at equal spacing around

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.440 
this one sort of at equal spacing around
your<00:02:03.530> yard<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.340> combination<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.240> those

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
your yard so the combination of those

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.780 
your yard so the combination of those
three<00:02:05.780> soil<00:02:06.200> samples<00:02:06.800> you're<00:02:07.280> gonna<00:02:07.430> have<00:02:07.640> in

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
three soil samples you're gonna have in

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.430 
three soil samples you're gonna have in
this<00:02:07.880> bag<00:02:08.090> you're<00:02:08.690> gonna<00:02:08.840> mix<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.289> all

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
this bag you're gonna mix it all

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.890 
this bag you're gonna mix it all
together<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.000> gives<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.690> pretty

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
together so that really gives a pretty

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.290 
together so that really gives a pretty
good<00:02:12.050> sample<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.740> your<00:02:12.890> entire<00:02:13.220> yard<00:02:13.550> not<00:02:13.940> one

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
good sample of your entire yard not one

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.900 
good sample of your entire yard not one
single<00:02:14.780> space<00:02:15.050> then<00:02:16.010> once<00:02:16.280> you've<00:02:16.430> got<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.760> all

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
single space then once you've got it all

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.809 
single space then once you've got it all
in<00:02:16.940> there

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
in there

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.809 
in there
you're<00:02:18.030> gonna<00:02:18.260> seal<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.409> top<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.610> air

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
you're gonna seal the top get the air

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.970 
you're gonna seal the top get the air
out<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.209> bit<00:02:21.420> roll<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.959> up<00:02:24.829> you<00:02:25.829> have<00:02:25.860> a
