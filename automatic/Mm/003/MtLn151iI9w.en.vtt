 varied can be dark purple and blue 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.439
 white rose and silver is also pretty cool 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.869
 toothbrushes that you no longer use 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.910
 Will not you use a brush of yours? 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.930
 use after only think you do not use 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.829
 more to a very fine tip brush 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.879
 to make more detailed drawings 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.590
 sponge and ribbon durex 10 senator edson

 Can be crepe tape 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 just to get on the floor like that 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.829
 not to stain the just happened not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.949
 to erase is not very difficult to take 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.500
 Rubber fabric ink but only for 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.589
 It does not take so much work or 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 good people here your sole right 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:12.150
 Okay, so here it is okay, I'll go 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 use that saucer on this plate and I 'll 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.220
 start with a lighter ink I'll 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.920
 get a little bit of that blue well 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.780
 A little bit like this is where I 'm going to start. 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.509
 here on this bottom of the sneakers 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.509
 Taking the paint and beating it here. 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.860
 started a background and seeing this 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 the clarinet very bright 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.140
 Then I'll see another sponge and I'll go 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 take a darker blue like there was in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.409
 back patting to give a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.409
 merged 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:14.770
 I like it all for the whole sneaker. 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.770
 and I'm making a goal by making the talent 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.430
 now that I've done so all the drawings 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.530
 and mixed colors here in the sneakers I came 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.870
 with the toothbrush 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.700
 so in white ink surrounds making the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:36.640
 to sneeze 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:40.130
 That way , I'm going to come back so white. 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.800
 also a little bit of silver paint 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.650
 and it's also inspiring, it 's just you. 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.670
 passing the finger so doing work doing 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:04:02.360
 several little drops to look like stars 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:06.440
 Limit the white farm to me. 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.890
 full of stars and mounts all dirty 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.410
 Grandma, now that I've done all these 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.720
 Splashes here on my sneakers 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.410
 seems very strange to see with the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.980
 brush very thin in that in ink 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.980
 white wrapping making starlets 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:41.060
 and I'm playing balls for me bigger and 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.060
 I can use ink dish too. 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.940
 savior 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.910
 well here is a perfect 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.380
 that foot'm done now expect 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.419
 dry to use the right one now 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.530
 I'll make another logic that will not stay 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.120
 just because it 's a criminal thing and it's going to 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.139
 stay different even 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.380
 but that's at the end of the video was a 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.690
