last<00:00:14.190> time<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.730> answered<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.330> question<00:00:15.450> what<00:00:16.260> is

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
last time we answered a question what is

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.460 
last time we answered a question what is
a<00:00:16.500> tilt<00:00:16.949> shift<00:00:17.010> lens<00:00:17.420> well<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.869> we're

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
a tilt shift lens well this time we're

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.720 
a tilt shift lens well this time we're
going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> answer<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> fisheye<00:00:21.660> lens

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
going to answer what is a fisheye lens

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.890 
going to answer what is a fisheye lens
obviously<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.910> fisheye<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.680> an<00:00:25.680> eye<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.130> fish

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
obviously a fisheye is an eye of a fish

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.830 
obviously a fisheye is an eye of a fish
let's<00:00:27.900> go<00:00:28.160> it's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.369> so-called<00:00:29.670> fisheye<00:00:30.539> lens

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
let's go it's a so-called fisheye lens

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630 
let's go it's a so-called fisheye lens
because<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> renders<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> world<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
because it renders the world in a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.810 
because it renders the world in a
spherical<00:00:33.059> weird<00:00:33.809> trout<00:00:34.620> Oh<00:00:34.649> vision<00:00:35.340> kind<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
spherical weird trout Oh vision kind of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.790 
spherical weird trout Oh vision kind of
way

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
way

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.229 
way
basically<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.430> badly<00:00:38.879> distorted

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
basically it's just a badly distorted

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.799 
basically it's just a badly distorted
lens<00:00:39.920> well<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.190> kind<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.579> true<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.450> lenses

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
lens well that's kind of true but lenses

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.810 
lens well that's kind of true but lenses
like<00:00:42.960> these<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.350> such<00:00:43.620> extreme<00:00:44.129> angles<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
like these with such extreme angles of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.549 
like these with such extreme angles of
view<00:00:44.940> are<00:00:45.149> incredibly<00:00:45.600> tough<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.110> design<00:00:46.410> in

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
view are incredibly tough to design in

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.220 
view are incredibly tough to design in
an<00:00:46.649> unsound<00:00:47.309> goggle<00:00:48.090> way<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:49.110> you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
an unsound goggle way are you

an unsound goggle way are you
rectilinear<00:00:50.090> see<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> fisheye<00:00:52.559> lens<00:00:53.000> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
rectilinear see with a fisheye lens you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.930 
rectilinear see with a fisheye lens you
get<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.350> everything<00:00:56.280> around<00:00:56.670> you

in a potentially dangerous situation it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.460 
in a potentially dangerous situation it
isn't<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> picture<00:01:50.460> being<00:01:50.610> taken<00:01:51.470> shoots

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
yet to get really close to them in fact

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.930 
yet to get really close to them in fact
we<00:02:04.200> got<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.620> close<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.100> him<00:02:05.250> he<00:02:05.280> told<00:02:05.580> us<00:02:05.760> where

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
we got so close to him he told us where

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
skateboarders with fisheye lenses they

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.690 
skateboarders with fisheye lenses they
got<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:15.690> up<00:02:15.870> close<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.410> action<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.580> they

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
got right up close to the action so they

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.500 
got right up close to the action so they
can<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:19.350> skateboarder<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.130> also<00:02:21.030> what's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
can get the skateboarder and also what's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.690 
can get the skateboarder and also what's
in<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.720> background<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.380> well<00:02:22.520> let's<00:02:23.520> give<00:02:23.670> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
in the background as well let's give it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.400 
in the background as well let's give it
a<00:02:23.820> go<00:02:25.850> but<00:02:26.850> he<00:02:27.090> cheated<00:02:27.750> us<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.230> were<00:02:28.380> no
