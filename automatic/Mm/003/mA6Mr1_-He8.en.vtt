00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.030
 good morning everyone well in this e3 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:06.650
 that is now being celebrated in the 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.750
 angels true sector of the press 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.610
 specialized in fifa has been able to prove 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.440
 fifa 13 and of course the first 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.330
 impressions could not be more positive 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.160
 far from the cold that has left us 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.050
 all the first trailer the news that 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.490
 come they are really promising in 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.470
 special about the intelligence of 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.480
 the partners in attack first give 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 credits to fifa social blog.com and in 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.079
 special to dave and atom that are both 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.010
 first editors who have published 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.050
 your impressions after trying the game 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.880
 and on that base this video for those who 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.080
 do not eat in English you have the link in the 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.020
 description of the original articles 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.580
 If you want them to look better 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.230
 first comment a little bit above 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.250
 in just a minute and a half the improvements that 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.440
 have nothing to do with the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.480
 artificial intelligence even if it has 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.860
 automated plus defense is easier 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.750
 bargain for those who use the button 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.090
 containment thanks to the complete dribling 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.590
 automatic containment no longer makes 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.059
 react so quickly to the defense and 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.920
 you really feel control of the ball 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.530
 with this new dribbling system using 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.780
 to wizards or small breaks for those who 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.370
 play against the machine the CPU now 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.320
 does not keep the ball as much as the fixed 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.990
 12 but they are still too fast 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.700
 and smart when it comes to spend anything 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.290
 new about the tactical failures but 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.020
 now it will be possible to draw quick faults from 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.370
 more usual way because although the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.170
 ball goes away from the place of 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.270
 infraction a partner will pass us 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.790
 to be able to make the fast serve what 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.020
 same would work in the throw-ins 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.700
 the impact engine really works 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.650
 well although you can not talk about 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.200
 perfection but the most common failures 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.580
 of fifa 12 are solved and the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.740
 control at first touch feels very 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.900
 natural nothing else we start playing at 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.030
 fifa 13 we will see how ridiculous and real that 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.369
 they are previous editions 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.900
 look now you have to think at the time of 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.549
 receive the ball so as not to put it on 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.470
 risk with control impossible only by 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.210
 try to gain some time and we'll see 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.490
 really differences between players of 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.040
 quality like ibrahimovic iniesta and others 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.810
 less skilled in that art though 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.340
 it will be corrected surely sometimes there 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.590
 very simple situations where the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.450
 control goes too far good 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.680
 let's go to the really important thing that is 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.200
 the intelligence of the attack of the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.950
 comrades is what has most surprised 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.140
 impressed those who have had the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.060
 Lucky to try the game is for everyone 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.860
 known that fifa 12 and earlier are a 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.929
 complete suspense in that section 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.910
 I'm not going to waste time on this because 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.370
 it is well known to all the way 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.470
 to behave from classmates 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.030
 static the word that best defines it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.160
 signature 13 however to change this 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.080
 a month ago in a closed presentation 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.480
 he witnessed that really the theory 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.370
 it was well implemented, it was still to be seen 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.650
 if it really would look good reflected with 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.600
 the same success in matches and it seems 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.850
 be that it has been so I have not used the button 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.709
 uncheck not once that's the phrase 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.350
 that has pronounced out on of fifa social 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.970
 blog at the end of its first game no longer 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.860
 you need to press no button to see 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.810
 if something happens around you when 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.910
 you play you do not see continuously career 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.590
 the degrees what is really impressive is 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.239
 see how it is positioned in each of the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.709
 players always looking for the best 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.800
 position according to what is happening 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.569
 in the play that is taking place 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.220
 are far or near the ball the 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.569
 unchecks that occur not only 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.280
 respond to situations where a 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.319
 front can be left alone in front 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.180
 of the goalie as we saw in the trailer 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.590
 but we will also see more races 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.200
 short or long to find spaces 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.489
 free and facilitate a pass not only 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.050
 we talk about supporting the partner that 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.670
 he has the ball but to think 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.680
 advancing that two moves to what he's going 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.510
 to pass this means that by 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.610
 example a right lateral can start 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.959
 a run to the center of the field if 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.150
 the left side has the ball and 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.980
 imagine that this can happen to the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.930
 so I would be better 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.340
 position to start the attack instead 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.799
 of staying behind waiting to touch the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.150
 ball is important to imply that these 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.200
 movements are automatic and 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.519
 smart 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.170
 think like a player would 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.250
 true they do not just worry about that 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.440
 can receive or not the ball 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.210
 immediately but in that past a 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.070
 can participate in that play 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.530
 the best example is the one that comments on 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.270
 fifa soccer vlog playing with chelsea 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.860
 after stealing a ball near the area 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.350
 ashley cole initial counterattacks and 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.790
 giving the ball to the central five 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.710
 or six passes after the ball is already 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.690
 approaches the rival area and at that moment 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.400
 the own goal appeared for the other band 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.560
 with a curved unmarked trying 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.300
 surprise the defense does it because 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.950
 by stealing the ball and reading the situation 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.780
 from the field he knows that there is 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.300
 possibility of counterattack and acts on 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.250
 consequence are movements that performs 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.260
 the cpu we do not have to send to 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.210
 player to attack is he who decides 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.850
 do it and how to do it if you see that it's in 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.860
 an ideal situation for this may be 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.510
 it seems a small problem in this respect and 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.400
 is that it would be necessary to be well 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.290
 controlled to be able to prevent a 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.910
 player in particular rise too much 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.460
 attack to not leave unguarded the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.140
 defense this could be made easy 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.940
 by tactics in the event that 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.130
 once and for all they work like 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.510
 they must, as I have already mentioned, the movement 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.460
 of the players is not limited to just 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.200
 unmarked in search of the goal 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.910
 so the partners mark what they have 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.620
 thought to do if they are going to look for the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.360
 uncheck and point it with your arm in 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.070
 the direction that they claim yes without 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.320
 However they will support you to look for a 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.090
 pass to the foot they will make a gesture that helps you 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.370
 understand what you intend to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.960
 perform for example by pointing to 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.540
 feet as often seen in a match 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.850
 football the unmarks will be full 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.590
 of new animations now we will see how 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.430
 the players try number 3 on outside 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.380
 of game 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.910
 for this they will use curved demarcations like this 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.560
 we will not see players who are still 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.900
 two or three meters in offside 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.490
 they keep running forward now 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.690
 will wait for the pass to be made 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.880
 run out in search of the ball 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.250
 finishing and I would like to clear one of 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.690
 the biggest concerns about it 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.430
 artificial intelligence works very 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.500
 well in attack but what happens in defense 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.390
 good will also be improved from it 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.010
 way that the attack like the 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.600
 attackers will look for open spaces and 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.180
 careers defenders will try 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.850
 cover those holes no doubt everything looks 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.620
 scandal may finally be that 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.660
 we can see passes like this face appears 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.490
 on screen or that we do not see each other 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.590
 frustrated when we are pressured 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.360
 by two or three players and none of 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.760
 our partners try to move 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.230
 to offer itself is ready to say anything 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.600
 until October we will continue with the doubts 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.190
 but if we pay attention to the first 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.990
 information from passionate players 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.330
 of the saga we have no choice but to 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.249
 be very optimistic very good to all 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.379
 I appreciate comments you share 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.549
 Where you want I like it or I do not like it 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.539
 subscribe you found interesting 

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:01.539
 and a gretting
