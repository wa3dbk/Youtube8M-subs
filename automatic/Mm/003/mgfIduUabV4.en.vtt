some elements of the force in the game
that<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.599> pretty<00:00:12.900> mind-blowing

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
that are pretty mind-blowing

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.860 
that are pretty mind-blowing
unfortunately<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> game<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.509> been<00:00:15.630> built

unfortunately the game that's been built
around<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.500> your<00:00:16.650> force<00:00:16.920> powers<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.460> all

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
around all your force powers and all

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.680 
around all your force powers and all
that<00:00:17.640> stuff<00:00:17.820> doesn't<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.330> take<00:00:18.570> advantage

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
that stuff doesn't really take advantage

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.900 
that stuff doesn't really take advantage
of<00:00:19.170> those<00:00:19.320> powers<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.920> well<00:00:19.949> as<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.550> so

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
of those powers as well as you like so

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.820 
of those powers as well as you like so
you<00:00:21.150> don't<00:00:21.570> really<00:00:21.689> get<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> experience<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.800> lot

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you don't really get to experience a lot

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.950 
you don't really get to experience a lot
of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.189> mind-blowing<00:00:23.760> stuff<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.480> often<00:00:24.810> as

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
of the mind-blowing stuff as often as

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:37.240 
of the mind-blowing stuff as often as
you<00:00:25.050> probably<00:00:25.350> like

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.660 

I<00:00:38.020> thought<00:00:39.020> probably<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.040> best<00:00:40.340> thing<00:00:40.610> about

I thought probably the best thing about
the<00:00:41.090> force<00:00:41.300> at<00:00:41.420> least<00:00:41.450> is<00:00:41.810> its<00:00:41.989> story<00:00:42.290> you're

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890

from<00:02:15.450> there<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.720> game<00:02:16.110> does<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.940> little

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
from there the game does get a little

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
from there the game does get a little
bit<00:02:18.150> deeper<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.660> not<00:02:19.170> necessarily<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.920> ways

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that compliment what you do early on you

that compliment what you do early on you

do keep unlocking force powers but in

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.610 
do keep unlocking force powers but in
addition<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.420> all<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:28.200> keep<00:02:28.380> running

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
addition to all that you keep running

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.140 
addition to all that you keep running
into<00:02:28.740> enemies<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.310> are<00:02:29.370> resistant<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> the

force and that just doesn't make the

force and that just doesn't make the
force<00:02:32.700> powers<00:02:33.030> very<00:02:33.180> much<00:02:33.420> fun<00:02:33.720> makes<00:02:34.590> the

force powers very much fun makes the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.140 
force powers very much fun makes the
game<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> little<00:02:35.040> more<00:02:35.190> complicated<00:02:35.700> than<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
game a little more complicated than it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.400 
game a little more complicated than it
probably<00:02:36.300> should<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.720> you're<00:02:37.050> running<00:02:37.320> around

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
probably should be you're running around

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.290 
probably should be you're running around
with<00:02:37.980> your<00:02:38.010> lightsaber<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.209> know

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
with your lightsaber and you know

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.640 
with your lightsaber and you know
sometimes<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.870> could<00:02:39.989> hack<00:02:40.140> him<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.350> couple<00:02:40.530> of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
sometimes you could hack him a couple of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.440 
sometimes you could hack him a couple of
times<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.040> then<00:02:41.160> lift<00:02:41.400> them<00:02:41.489> up<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:42.030> use

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
times and then lift them up or use

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.050 
times and then lift them up or use
lightning<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:44.010> never<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.790> works

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
lightning and it never really works

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.620 
lightning and it never really works
quite<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:45.870> well<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> simple<00:02:48.300> thrill

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
quite as well as just the simple thrill

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.540 
quite as well as just the simple thrill
of<00:02:48.900> picking<00:02:49.380> dudes<00:02:49.590> up<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:49.980> flinging<00:02:50.280> them

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
of picking dudes up and flinging them

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.550 
of picking dudes up and flinging them
around<00:02:50.790> as<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.570> result<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.110> end<00:02:52.140> up<00:02:52.320> relying

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
around as a result you end up relying

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.530 
around as a result you end up relying
more<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.160> lightsaber<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.060> combos

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
more on your lightsaber and the combos

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180 
more on your lightsaber and the combos
that<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.810> get<00:02:54.989> with<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.140> then<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.040> these

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
that you get with that then on these

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.740 
that you get with that then on these
different<00:02:56.550> forest<00:02:56.850> powers<00:02:57.209> which<00:02:57.420> really

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
different forest powers which really

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.210 
different forest powers which really
kind<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.989> takes<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.320> most<00:02:58.500> interesting<00:02:58.920> parts

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
kind of takes the most interesting parts

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.350 
kind of takes the most interesting parts
of<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.400> game<00:02:59.580> away<00:02:59.820> from<00:02:59.850> you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.090 

the<00:03:04.110> game<00:03:04.260> also<00:03:04.440> has<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.890> weird

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
the game also has a really weird

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.979 
the game also has a really weird
tendency<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.850> flip<00:03:06.120> back<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.570> forth<00:03:06.630> on

tendency to flip back and forth on
difficulty<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.220> feels<00:03:08.459> really<00:03:08.730> uneven

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
difficulty it feels really uneven

overall<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:10.080> goes<00:03:10.290> from<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.860> know

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
know really a sign that you know the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.860 
know really a sign that you know the
tactics<00:04:16.579> you're<00:04:16.730> using<00:04:16.970> are<00:04:17.239> effective

tactics you're using are effective
you'll<00:04:18.169> knock<00:04:18.620> him<00:04:18.769> over<00:04:18.890> here<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.340> there<00:04:19.489> but

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
you'll knock him over here and there but

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.789 
you'll knock him over here and there but
then<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:19.940> same<00:04:20.150> attack<00:04:20.390> won't<00:04:20.660> work<00:04:20.930> again<00:04:21.290> I

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
then the same attack won't work again I

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.460 
then the same attack won't work again I
never<00:04:22.460> really<00:04:22.730> got<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> feel<00:04:23.540> for<00:04:23.900> what<00:04:24.320> was

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
never really got a feel for what was

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.260 
never really got a feel for what was
opening<00:04:24.830> them<00:04:24.980> up<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.250> attack<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.180> know

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
opening them up to attack and you know

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.880 
opening them up to attack and you know
what<00:04:26.450> their<00:04:26.600> weaknesses<00:04:26.720> were<00:04:27.260> instead<00:04:27.710> it

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
what their weaknesses were instead it

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.950 
what their weaknesses were instead it
more<00:04:28.310> felt<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.940> was<00:04:29.210> just<00:04:29.419> kind<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:29.660> dying

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
more felt like I was just kind of dying

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.110 
more felt like I was just kind of dying
four<00:04:30.380> or<00:04:30.470> five<00:04:30.650> times<00:04:30.890> but<00:04:31.310> every<00:04:31.520> time<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.820> died

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
four or five times but every time I died

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.659 
four or five times but every time I died
I<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.690> got<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.110> little<00:04:33.320> bit<00:04:33.620> more<00:04:33.890> savvy<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.580> the

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
I I got a little bit more savvy to the

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.070 
I I got a little bit more savvy to the
attack<00:04:34.940> patterns<00:04:35.390> they<00:04:35.510> were<00:04:35.570> using<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:36.020> the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
attack patterns they were using to the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.170 
attack patterns they were using to the
point<00:04:36.320> where<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.650> well<00:04:36.860> now<00:04:37.640> I'll<00:04:37.790> just<00:04:37.940> hide

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
point where like well now I'll just hide

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.760 
point where like well now I'll just hide
behind<00:04:38.210> this<00:04:38.660> rock<00:04:38.930> because<00:04:39.200> they've<00:04:39.590> lifted

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
behind this rock because they've lifted

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.409 
behind this rock because they've lifted
stuff<00:04:40.160> up<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.640> as<00:04:40.729> soon<00:04:40.880> as<00:04:40.940> they<00:04:41.060> do<00:04:41.120> that

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
stuff up and as soon as they do that

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.480 
stuff up and as soon as they do that
they're<00:04:41.660> gonna<00:04:41.720> be<00:04:41.930> open<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.290> this<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:42.919> it

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
they're gonna be open to this and it

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.250 
they're gonna be open to this and it
felt<00:04:43.729> kind<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.419> was<00:04:44.600> cheating<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
felt kind of like I was cheating and

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.560 
felt kind of like I was cheating and
it's<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:46.160> frustration<00:04:46.790> factor<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.360> really

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it's that frustration factor that really

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.690 
it's that frustration factor that really
brings<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.990> game<00:04:48.169> down<00:04:48.610> there<00:04:49.610> are

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
brings the game down there are

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.960 
brings the game down there are
definitely<00:04:50.030> some<00:04:50.240> really<00:04:50.390> great<00:04:50.720> tools<00:04:51.080> here

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
definitely some really great tools here

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.100 
definitely some really great tools here
but<00:04:52.970> when<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.210> combine<00:04:53.570> them<00:04:53.690> with<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.900> game

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
but when you combine them with the game

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.810 
but when you combine them with the game
it<00:04:54.290> doesn't<00:04:54.560> really<00:04:54.650> come<00:04:54.890> together<00:04:55.100> as<00:04:55.370> well

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
it doesn't really come together as well

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.480 
it doesn't really come together as well
as<00:04:55.850> as<00:04:56.570> you'd<00:04:56.840> really<00:04:57.110> want<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.890> as<00:04:58.400> a

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
as as you'd really want to and as a

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.969 
as as you'd really want to and as a
result<00:04:58.820> it's<00:04:59.210> pretty<00:04:59.450> disappointing<00:05:00.140> Darth

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
result it's pretty disappointing Darth

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.050 
result it's pretty disappointing Darth
Vader<00:05:01.220> has<00:05:01.430> found<00:05:01.760> us<00:05:02.030> perhaps<00:05:03.400> Marus<00:05:04.400> gather
