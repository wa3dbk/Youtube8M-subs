because<00:01:23.280> somebody's<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.150> switching

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
because somebody's in the way switching

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
different angle and creates a whole new

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
different angle and creates a whole new
set<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> passing<00:01:28.890> options<00:01:29.280> looking<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.210> this
