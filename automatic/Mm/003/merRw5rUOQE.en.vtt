they teach because they speak English
every<00:05:20.740> time<00:05:20.950> because<00:05:21.700> they<00:05:21.880> don't<00:05:22.060> know<00:05:22.210> how

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
every time because they don't know how

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.630 
every time because they don't know how
to<00:05:22.360> speak<00:05:23.140> French<00:05:23.169> so<00:05:23.590> I<00:05:23.860> have<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.400> speak

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
to speak French so I have to speak
