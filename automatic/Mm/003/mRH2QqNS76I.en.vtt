00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
back echo quilting that stem so that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
back echo quilting that stem so that
it's<00:00:22.619> doubled<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.279> have<00:00:23.430> two<00:00:23.699> lines<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.539> kind

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
it's doubled you have two lines and kind

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's doubled you have two lines and kind
of<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.960> channel<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.470> between<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.220> that's<00:00:26.880> going

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of a channel in between and that's going

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.939 
of a channel in between and that's going
to<00:00:27.269> draw<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.170> bit<00:00:28.289> more<00:00:28.439> attention<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
different look now the second step to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.120 
different look now the second step to
feathers<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.809> actually<00:00:34.260> stitching<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
feathers is actually stitching the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
feathers is actually stitching the
feathers<00:00:35.460> onto<00:00:35.880> your<00:00:36.059> stem<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.020> see

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
feathers onto your stem and you can see

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
feathers onto your stem and you can see
I<00:00:37.200> rotate<00:00:37.829> my<00:00:37.860> quilting<00:00:38.340> space<00:00:38.640> because<00:00:39.540> how

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I rotate my quilting space because how

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.459 
I rotate my quilting space because how
it<00:00:39.899> works<00:00:40.079> best<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.530> me<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.469> work

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it works best for me is to kind of work

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.270 
it works best for me is to kind of work
from<00:00:43.969> either<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> bottom<00:00:45.390> down<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> top

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
from either the bottom down or the top

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
from either the bottom down or the top
bottom<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> top<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.840> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
bottom going up or the top down it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.959 
bottom going up or the top down it's
just<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
just really it's going to be one of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.069 
just really it's going to be one of
those<00:00:51.090> things<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.449> kind<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
those things you just kind of have to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
those things you just kind of have to
experiment<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.219> works<00:00:53.730> best<00:00:53.879> for

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
experiment and see what works best for

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.930 
experiment and see what works best for
you<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.640> these<00:00:56.879> are

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
you so you can see how these are

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.000 
you so you can see how these are
stitched<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.079> simply<00:00:58.320> branching<00:00:58.859> out

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
stitched is just simply branching out

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.569 
stitched is just simply branching out
you're<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.090> stitch<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.510> circle<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.579> then

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you're going to stitch a circle and then

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
you're going to stitch a circle and then
you're<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> travel<00:01:03.539> stitch<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:04.199> way

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you're going to travel stitch your way

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
you're going to travel stitch your way
back<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.949> right<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> area<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.659> between

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
back down right in that area in between

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.800 
back down right in that area in between
the<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.260> feathers<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:09.119> reason<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the two feathers and the reason that I'm

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
the two feathers and the reason that I'm
stitching<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.619> way<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.580> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
stitching it this way is because I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359 
stitching it this way is because I
wanted<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> add<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.320> something<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.860> little

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
wanted to add just something a little

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.270 
wanted to add just something a little
extra<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> idea<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
extra and I really like the idea of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.270 
extra and I really like the idea of
adding<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.850> circle<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.020> feathers<00:01:19.500> because

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
adding a circle to my feathers because

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.420 
adding a circle to my feathers because
it<00:01:20.909> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> looks<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:22.229> butterfly<00:01:22.860> wing

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it kind of looks like a butterfly wing

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.820 
it kind of looks like a butterfly wing
you<00:01:23.790> know<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.119> circles<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.110> tips<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you know the circles on the tips of a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
you know the circles on the tips of a
butterfly<00:01:26.610> wing<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.840> adds<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.229> little

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
butterfly wing and it adds a little

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
butterfly wing and it adds a little
extra<00:01:28.619> texture<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.640> adds<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.090> extra

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
extra texture it adds a little extra

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
extra texture it adds a little extra
interest<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> those<00:01:32.040> things

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
interest and it's one of those things

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.240 
interest and it's one of those things
that<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.119> pops<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that just kind of pops out at you so you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.969 
that just kind of pops out at you so you
can<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:35.700> how<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.090> formed<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.829> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
can see how this is formed and this is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
can see how this is formed and this is
kind<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> an<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> unique<00:01:38.790> way<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> form<00:01:39.630> feathers

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
kind of an a unique way to form feathers

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.190 
kind of an a unique way to form feathers
as<00:01:40.650> far<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.210> kind<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.360> stitching<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
as far as kind of stitching out and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
circular shape and that might actually
