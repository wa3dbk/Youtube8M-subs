00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.970
 blogs last product launch for the time being 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.320
 I still have the cash back but the search 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.179
 another possibility for you 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.420
 not easy to show playfully 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 to take apart 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.820
 Here you can use the step back product base 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 to every edition there and I know through 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 the clicks on the channel pretty much 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 that's a very popular one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.359
 product the videos of pet beck 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.230
 get the biggest clicks 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.160
 Please do not be surprised if you are fat 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.960
 looks different 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.750
 There is 1 for every budget citizen 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.829
 visually different outside that now the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 Variant with james the cashback is available 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.489
 only English has multiple times is just like that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.160
 but he is also a player addressed 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.590
 who want direct power booster 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.530
 to have more content just want one 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.149
 a bit long nice box contributes 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.550
 not for the complete beginner 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.789
 thought now standard countries in it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 still 80 pieces of new booster packs 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.280
 and spin down cube two boxes of park 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.650
 players tradition 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.650
 maybe that already knows otherwise 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.000
 be curious we unpack it and if 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.700
 we stay tuned we also make an end 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 not a booster on all unfortunately not 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.590
 but we know we'll have a look 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.640
 I do not know what to post 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.579
 we have ever been the players guide 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.150
 gives to each edition at the same time 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.500
 curious if it wanted to preserve 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.380
 know what the mechanics are 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 history of the plains poker party 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.229
 cards and then of course the complete one 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.460
 cards gallery with checklist was thought 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.619
 but mine has the complete map 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.979
 you can already see what else in 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.509
 The edition is included in the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:07.459
 banderole on the packaging the above 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:10.800
 Gently open explained poster 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.170
 Obviously the case with jazz with 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.360
 said the sentence rushing on it 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.490
 if you want to hang up spokesman there 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.120
 do you have to load or games in which one 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.990
 which may well bring on the wall 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.990
 to wake up a bit of paper 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.550
 spacers the hints not so 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.540
 important here , as I said the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.690
 blackbox the fed pack box very stable 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:43.090
 cardboard really useful over and over again 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.580
 the things so the two boxes from now 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.010
 maybe already seen several times 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:55.870
 here and there times useful as long as the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.500
 Nevertheless, services will not do anything 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.020
 because the player gives dice applause 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.110
