00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.650
 if they pay attention to a leg, missing persons always point to something magical 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.259
 but in recent years I think that he has a little balance 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.699
 is of 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.910
 think of the excesses and the z4 m coupe that are not really the most 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.300
 spectacular models 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.749
 just the retiring last 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.769
 pure and thick during the m3 csl that is very positive surprise 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.420
 there i am going to watch this brand new one and problem 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.420
 get that feeling back 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.250
 but what makes a and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.190
 To begin with, it naturally looks thick that everyone can see it wider 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.420
 wheel arches larger air inlets 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.490
 is somewhat lower spoilers 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.550
 but I don't really like that, it is nice, but it is 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.640
 it's about water 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 subcutaneous happened 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370
 van houts estate and import 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.640
 racing technology is paramount in that sense you could say that this m coupÃ© a 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.259
 bit 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.970
 at constant for short for a light engine 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.770
 is not a specific block but an engine that also sits in other models 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.510
 but that does not alter the fact that five races are still 340 horsepower but 350 kilometers 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.510
 that goes from 0 to 100 within five seconds 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 and that sounds like they love 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.170
 why 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 langelaar it great 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.940
 but I still have to get used to winning it all and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.410
 for washed stairs spherical and 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.050
 beh 100 hp by unseen know that as the hobby horse of him 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.010
 and that was accompanied by much more to hear and that the atmospheric v8 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.470
 that atmosphere is central what has changed this man less times 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.589
 both at the front and at the rear it has three components and others is scarce 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:24.529
 however, the reason for the guests is limited differential, but the steering is extremely strong 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.940
 the men from and also opted for the adjustment 10 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.749
 In particular, many have forgotten 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.159
 register with the relatively short wheelbase and against the proposals that 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.589
 is very mobile 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.589
 and the players 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.969
 that promises what chassis is now so good and you get it 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:58.719
 17 Feb 2011 it is its own school in conflict eight mornings in total there 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.719
 nothing for it at all 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.349
 the 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.810
 but this one really arrives at spot one of my to of a list 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.799
 with favorite this state when it's great 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.900
 only point of criticism not a bit heavy is almost 15 pounds were there are quite 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.099
 what made up for the rest I say 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.909
 welcome back
