00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.700
 Halli hello here is the last of raw 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.940
 energy welcome i want 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 have a recipe today 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.650
 Although present ayurvedic waffles 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.259
 in vegan form I was last at 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 a cooking course for herbal 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.130
 ayurvedic cuisine and have this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.810
 recipe since I learned a bit 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 Modified a bit healthier 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 I was and wanted to show it like this 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.210
 we need 400 for that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.989
 gramm fine hair spots 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.809
 then we need 750 degrees hot water 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.260
 that comes from the kettle year 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.550
 should be as hot as possible then have 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.859
 We have three tablespoons of oil in the original recipe 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.260
 is that with the so with this feed 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.969
 reinfeldt of the cities of the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.559
 Cookery had something in common with coconut oil 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.050
 I'm not such a fan of coke about 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.090
 The much saturated fatty acids are here 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.339
 this bradl had seven grams 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.830
 saturated fatty acids per 100 milliliters 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.300
 and the highly heated so changed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.800
 not clear the formula so no 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.390
 Transferred so I'm always a 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.650
 great fan of that tastes to him 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.420
 also very good with it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.310
 then we need half a second 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 Teaspoon baking powder then I take 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.960
 now this time these rows of tartar 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 baking powder from alnatura then can be pure 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.750
 three tablespoons full of cane sugar 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.640
 I'm on sugar too 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.950
 it is super premium that is 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.510
 solid that tastes very good but you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.930
 You can also take three of cane sugar 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.210
 tablespoon then a quarter teaspoon 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.000
 sea ​​salt I now have her blood pressure 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.830
 salt taken by dr jacobs there it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 half still added with karin das 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.940
 means one has actually half 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.620
 The potassium helps with sodium 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.630
 stop the sodium balance again 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.780
 everything will actually salt so 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.610
 after so here half of the many 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.460
 quarter teaspoon I watch on my 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.560
 slip yes a quarter teaspoon then 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 half a teaspoon 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.240
 cinnamon and years from the order me 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.310
 show it to you right now 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.250
 video it is perhaps best that way 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.470
 take this oatmeal gives the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.110
 dry ingredients rows mingled that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.630
 then add the water and then on 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.370
 the oil will get through this once and for all 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.110
 let it then so about ten minutes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.580
 swell that torments then really 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.000
 and I'll show you then like that 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000
 looks 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.890
 and now for ten minutes 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.380
 make the oats so swell 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.070
 now ten good tortured 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.840
 Here's a hot waffle iron I've got 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.410
 even such a Belgian waffle maker and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.840
 the spade here just what even more difficult 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.830
 in principle it is to serve and the dough 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.270
 I have to be very, very liquid that is 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.700
 not at all as you can see it is one 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.780
 really thick oatmeal and you ask 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.070
 you maybe like that but I can 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.630
 show you that just has to go 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.580
 apply some violence then you have 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.590
 fully horny weapons if the less fat 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.530
 By the way , you want to be able to have her 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.580
 Always try these three tablespoons of oil 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.780
 decomposed three tablespoons 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.730
 apple market I do not have that yet 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.410
 but tried maybe it can indeed 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.950
 let's try the comments 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.540
 write 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.460
 if that works then you have 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.780
 of course then as good as fat free up 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.490
 on the fat that you really need 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.320
 that the single beds because that goes 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.090
 otherwise travel immediately broken summer 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.930
 yes you can also normal thing silent 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.450
 I have such a Belgian and the one here 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.450
 pact here just that one here 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.129
 Now we come up with a trick with violence 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.129
 suppress 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.890
 it will be distributed nicely now 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.580
 and accordingly some were 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:34.060
 so the first two weapons are ready 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.220
 if you ever get out of this way and in total 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.770
 so come out with eight waffles 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.270
 My Belgian waffle maker looks very much 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.949
 great from tastes great with 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.949
 jam to taste the taste 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:51.910
 super as always been a few times 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:53.560
 made sooner must be delicious yet 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.569
 a tip that makes waffle iron 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.789
 really hot and pushes it too 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.620
 really good down to make it stop also in 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.289
 It will be good because it is a right one 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.910
 Hard consistency and yes tastes great 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.930
 really cool is really one 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.479
 main meal 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.610
 that was enough for two people even because 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.900
 yes, a bit fat in it is 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.910
 makes a total say yes that partially 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.169
 in the morning eaten again in the evening something 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.539
 eaten to dinner because I like the whole 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.490
