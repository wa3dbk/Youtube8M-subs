to turn on the power and get jugg you

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.130 
to turn on the power and get jugg you
might<00:00:45.210> want<00:00:45.330> to<00:00:45.360> check<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.019> need

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
might want to check that up you need

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.539 
might want to check that up you need
help<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.979> once<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.190> turn<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.430> the

help with that but once you turn on the
power<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:49.440> electric<00:00:49.860> guy<00:00:50.040> will<00:00:50.250> come<00:00:50.400> out

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
power this electric guy will come out

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.469 
power this electric guy will come out
now<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.680> dr.<00:00:53.220> max's<00:00:53.879> side<00:00:54.180> of

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
now I'm going to do dr. max's side of

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.570 
now I'm going to do dr. max's side of
the<00:00:54.570> story<00:00:54.839> line<00:00:55.080> there's<00:00:55.650> two<00:00:55.890> sides<00:00:56.189> there's

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
the story line there's two sides there's

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.340 
the story line there's two sides there's
Richthofen<00:00:57.239> z'<00:00:57.269> which<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.199> more

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
Richthofen z' which is a bit more

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.829 
Richthofen z' which is a bit more
difficult<00:00:58.409> we're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.400> need<00:00:59.549> all<00:01:00.089> four

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
difficult we're going to need all four

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.770 
difficult we're going to need all four
of<00:01:00.869> your<00:01:01.650> characters<00:01:02.610> to<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.939> EMP<00:01:03.420> grenades

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
of your characters to have EMP grenades

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
of your characters to have EMP grenades
and<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.350> difficult<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.430> i<00:01:05.460> am<00:01:05.670> going

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and that's very difficult but i am going

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.230 
and that's very difficult but i am going
to<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.090> doctor<00:01:06.510> Maxis<00:01:07.140> aside<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.820> only<00:01:08.969> one

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to do doctor Maxis aside so I'm only one

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.459 
to do doctor Maxis aside so I'm only one
of<00:01:09.390> us<00:01:09.509> need<00:01:09.719> EMPs

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
of us need EMPs

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.080 
of us need EMPs
so<00:01:10.859> on<00:01:11.189> both<00:01:11.340> sides<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.729> need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> put

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
so on both sides you need to put

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.599 
so on both sides you need to put
together<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.630> table<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.560> Ascalon<00:01:14.039> table

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
together that table the Ascalon table

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.969 
together that table the Ascalon table
so<00:01:15.090> once<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.719> put<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.049> together<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.740> turn<00:01:16.950> on

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
so once we put that together go turn on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.459 
so once we put that together go turn on
the<00:01:17.159> power<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.270> we're<00:01:18.420> doing<00:01:18.509> dr.<00:01:18.960> Max's

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
the power now when we're doing dr. Max's

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:36.060 
the power now when we're doing dr. Max's
side<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:21.299> list<00:01:21.539> term<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:21.929> here

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.320 

so<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.130> hear<00:01:37.340> him<00:01:37.430> he<00:01:37.549> says<00:01:37.729> he<00:01:37.850> wants<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.119> turn

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
so you hear him he says he wants to turn

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.180 
so you hear him he says he wants to turn
the<00:01:38.509> power<00:01:38.720> off<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.470> there's<00:01:39.680> definitely<00:01:39.799> some

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
the power off so there's definitely some

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.010 
the power off so there's definitely some
story<00:01:40.520> -<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.060> go<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.299> Richthofen<00:01:41.869> way

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
story - and if you go the Richthofen way

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.990 
story - and if you go the Richthofen way
you'll<00:01:42.710> hear<00:01:42.979> his<00:01:43.130> voice<00:01:43.340> when<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.700> turn<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
you'll hear his voice when you turn the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.910 
you'll hear his voice when you turn the
power<00:01:44.180> on<00:01:44.420> now<00:01:44.780> we<00:01:44.840> might<00:01:45.049> try<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.680> after

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
power on now we might try that one after

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.100 
power on now we might try that one after
this<00:01:46.070> we<00:01:46.250> might<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.540> took<00:01:47.810> me<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> whole

really<00:01:57.500> rough<00:01:57.770> but<00:01:58.340> once<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.580> turn<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.850> power

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
really rough but once you turn the power

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.139 
really rough but once you turn the power
off<00:02:00.100> you'll<00:02:01.100> want<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.280> make<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.580> run<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.940> go

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
off you'll want to make the run to go

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.430 
off you'll want to make the run to go
back<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.630> table<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:02.990> we<00:02:03.140> put<00:02:03.319> together

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
back to the table that we put together

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.260 
back to the table that we put together

that<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.269> difference<00:02:08.660> between<00:02:08.950> Richtofen

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
that so the difference between Richtofen

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.640 
that so the difference between Richtofen
and<00:02:10.069> Maxis<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.940> not<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> lot<00:02:11.660> both<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.470> put

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
and Maxis is not a lot both of you put

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.380 
and Maxis is not a lot both of you put
together<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.130> table<00:02:13.550> but<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> key

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
together the table but the key

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.259 
together the table but the key
difference<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.580> Richthofen<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.120> to

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
difference is in Richthofen you have to

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.000 
difference is in Richthofen you have to
go<00:02:17.450> put<00:02:17.690> together<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.470> heavy<00:02:18.709> like

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
go put together like this heavy like

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.309 
go put together like this heavy like
machine<00:02:19.459> type<00:02:19.790> deal<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.870> be<00:02:20.989> honest<00:02:21.230> I

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
machine type deal and to be honest I

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.479 
machine type deal and to be honest I
haven't<00:02:21.500> done<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.980> don't<00:02:22.130> know<00:02:22.220> what<00:02:22.340> really

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
haven't done it I don't know what really

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.250 
haven't done it I don't know what really
fully<00:02:22.850> I've<00:02:23.060> seen<00:02:23.299> you<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.540> videos<00:02:23.930> about

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
fully I've seen you know videos about

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.960 
fully I've seen you know videos about
both<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.650> them<00:02:24.950> but<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.519> know<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.850> like

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
both of them but I know you have to like

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.789 
both of them but I know you have to like
put<00:02:26.209> together<00:02:26.450> machine<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.410> then<00:02:27.500> at<00:02:27.620> one

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
put together machine and then at one

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.550 
put together machine and then at one
part<00:02:28.130> at<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.549> end<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.420> have<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.630> all<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:30.080> EMP

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
part at the end you have to all have EMP

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.100 
part at the end you have to all have EMP
grenades<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.160> throw<00:02:31.310> them<00:02:31.459> at<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.110> lamppost

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
grenades and throw them at the lamppost

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.240 
grenades and throw them at the lamppost
I<00:02:33.470> did<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:33.799> you<00:02:33.860> can<00:02:33.980> do<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.130> with<00:02:34.220> two

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
I did here you can do it with two

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.830 
I did here you can do it with two
players<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.030> tell<00:02:35.239> for<00:02:35.540> at<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.690> right

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
players if you tell for at the right

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.199 
players if you tell for at the right
time<00:02:36.079> but<00:02:36.680> it's<00:02:36.829> very<00:02:36.980> difficult<00:02:37.489> no<00:02:37.760> one<00:02:37.970> with

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
time but it's very difficult no one with

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.420 
time but it's very difficult no one with
doing<00:02:38.870> doctor<00:02:39.230> Maxis<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:40.100> one<00:02:40.310> right

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
doing doctor Maxis is this one right

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.880 
doing doctor Maxis is this one right
here<00:02:40.790> all<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.660> do<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.989> put<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> oskol

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
here all you have to do is put the oskol

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.130 
here all you have to do is put the oskol
on<00:02:43.010> table<00:02:43.400> together<00:02:43.519> do<00:02:44.299> this<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.840> step

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
on table together do this this step

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.870 
on table together do this this step
right<00:02:45.320> here<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.829> then<00:02:45.950> do<00:02:46.070> one<00:02:46.250> final<00:02:46.489> step

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
right here and then do one final step

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.670 
right here and then do one final step
it's<00:02:47.120> pretty<00:02:47.480> simple<00:02:47.989> it's<00:02:48.109> a<00:02:48.200> lot<00:02:48.320> easier<00:02:48.590> in

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
it's pretty simple it's a lot easier in

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.599 
it's pretty simple it's a lot easier in
this<00:02:48.859> step<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:50.859> it'll<00:02:51.859> be<00:02:51.950> done<00:02:52.160> but<00:02:52.430> it's

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
this step and it'll be done but it's

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.190 
this step and it'll be done but it's
still<00:02:52.820> they're<00:02:53.120> both<00:02:53.269> very<00:02:53.480> hard<00:02:53.780> Easter<00:02:54.079> eggs

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
still they're both very hard Easter eggs

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.180 
still they're both very hard Easter eggs
and<00:02:54.350> it's<00:02:54.500> taken<00:02:54.739> me<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:54.829> while<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.130> actually

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
and it's taken me a while to actually

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.890 
and it's taken me a while to actually
get<00:02:55.519> them<00:02:55.700> complete<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.420> I'm<00:02:56.510> trying<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.810> get

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
get them complete so I'm trying to get

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.000

need<00:03:25.519> two<00:03:25.730> turbines<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.450> at<00:03:26.540> least<00:03:26.690> need<00:03:26.930> two

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
need two turbines you at least need two

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.680 
need two turbines you at least need two
players<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:27.890> have<00:03:28.519> two<00:03:28.790> your<00:03:29.000> players<00:03:29.299> have

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
players so have two your players have

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.750 
players so have two your players have
turbines<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.620> you're<00:03:31.130> pretty<00:03:31.280> much<00:03:31.489> going<00:03:31.700> to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
turbines and you're pretty much going to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.120 
turbines and you're pretty much going to
camp<00:03:32.030> right<00:03:32.390> here<00:03:32.420> with<00:03:33.200> your<00:03:33.319> turbines<00:03:33.829> and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
camp right here with your turbines and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.910 
camp right here with your turbines and
your<00:03:34.489> EMP<00:03:34.880> grenades<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.440> wait<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.650> while

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
your EMP grenades so you wait a while

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.830 
your EMP grenades so you wait a while
after<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.489> turn<00:03:37.700> back<00:03:37.910> up<00:03:38.090> or<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.420> turn<00:03:38.600> on

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
after you turn back up or you turn on

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.449 
after you turn back up or you turn on
the<00:03:38.989> power<00:03:39.019> then<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.500> turn<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.739> back<00:03:39.949> off<00:03:40.160> when

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
the power then you turn it back off when

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.969 
the power then you turn it back off when
the<00:03:40.609> power<00:03:40.790> is<00:03:40.880> off<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.870> electrical<00:03:42.410> guy<00:03:42.530> will

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
the power is off the electrical guy will

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.320 
the power is off the electrical guy will
show<00:03:43.310> up<00:03:43.519> eventually

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
show up eventually

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.030 
show up eventually
so<00:03:44.900> we're<00:03:45.110> waiting<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.530> electric<00:03:45.860> gotta

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
so we're waiting for the electric gotta

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.880 
so we're waiting for the electric gotta
show<00:03:46.310> up<00:03:46.340> now<00:03:47.050> he's<00:03:48.050> going<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.290> finally<00:03:48.710> show

up here right there and we're gonna

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.030 
up here right there and we're gonna
place<00:03:50.690> our<00:03:50.840> turbines<00:03:51.290> on<00:03:51.470> each<00:03:51.590> side<00:03:51.830> and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
place our turbines on each side and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.960 
place our turbines on each side and
you're<00:03:52.130> gonna<00:03:52.190> hear<00:03:52.400> him<00:03:52.490> talking<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.910> little

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
you're gonna hear him talking a little

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.490 
you're gonna hear him talking a little
bit<00:03:53.090> more<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:55.880> hear<00:03:56.060> him<00:03:56.180> he<00:03:57.020> says<00:03:57.230> we<00:03:57.410> need

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
bit more you hear him he says we need

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.280 
bit more you hear him he says we need
additional<00:03:57.620> energy<00:03:58.160> systems<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.540> I'm<00:04:00.020> gonna

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
additional energy systems so I'm gonna

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.290 
additional energy systems so I'm gonna
attract<00:04:00.830> this<00:04:01.160> lightning<00:04:01.550> guy<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.700> come<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.180> us

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
attract this lightning guy to come to us

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.540 
attract this lightning guy to come to us
but<00:04:02.510> since<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.960> powers<00:04:03.320> and<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:03.620> he<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.370> take

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
but since the powers and on he can take

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.850 
but since the powers and on he can take
us<00:04:04.580> out<00:04:04.850> in<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.210> two<00:04:05.630> hits<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.500> we<00:04:06.590> got<00:04:06.710> to<00:04:06.800> be

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
us out in like two hits so we got to be

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.410 
us out in like two hits so we got to be
extremely<00:04:07.370> careful<00:04:07.550> but<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> need<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> get<00:04:08.270> him

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
extremely careful but I need to get him

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.720 
extremely careful but I need to get him
in<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.600> radius<00:04:09.020> of<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.740> tower<00:04:10.010> because<00:04:10.490> we

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
in the radius of the tower because we

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.850 
in the radius of the tower because we
want<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.030> draw<00:04:11.240> him<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.810> we<00:04:12.380> want<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.680> throw

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
want to draw him in and we want to throw

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.130 
want to draw him in and we want to throw
a<00:04:13.540> EMP<00:04:14.540> at<00:04:15.020> him<00:04:15.470> for<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.340> second<00:04:16.730> step<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.150> so

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
a EMP at him for the second step and so

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.289 
a EMP at him for the second step and so
um<00:04:18.350> I'm<00:04:18.920> pretty<00:04:19.250> rad<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.640> he<00:04:19.730> attacks<00:04:20.060> me

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
um I'm pretty rad and he attacks me

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.880 
um I'm pretty rad and he attacks me
again<00:04:20.720> here<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.959> little<00:04:21.170> bit<00:04:21.320> we<00:04:21.560> end<00:04:21.680> up<00:04:21.799> I

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
again here a little bit we end up I

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.290 
again here a little bit we end up I
think<00:04:21.950> we<00:04:22.190> both<00:04:22.340> go<00:04:22.520> down<00:04:22.550> on<00:04:22.820> one<00:04:22.940> point<00:04:23.150> but

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
think we both go down on one point but

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.900 
think we both go down on one point but
we<00:04:23.360> get<00:04:23.480> each<00:04:23.570> other<00:04:23.750> up<00:04:23.960> which<00:04:24.170> is<00:04:24.320> great<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
we get each other up which is great and

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.980 
we get each other up which is great and
let's<00:04:25.910> see<00:04:26.300> what<00:04:26.420> happens<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:29.720> know<00:04:29.840> this

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
let's see what happens so you know this

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.900 
let's see what happens so you know this
steps<00:04:30.260> really<00:04:30.620> really<00:04:30.830> hard<00:04:31.130> this<00:04:31.490> Easter<00:04:31.820> Egg

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
steps really really hard this Easter Egg

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.370 
steps really really hard this Easter Egg
I<00:04:31.940> mean<00:04:32.120> it's<00:04:32.210> hard<00:04:32.420> to<00:04:32.540> get<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.720> MPs<00:04:33.080> but<00:04:33.170> it's

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
I mean it's hard to get the MPs but it's

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.990 
I mean it's hard to get the MPs but it's
really<00:04:33.590> hard<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.100> have<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.370> hold<00:04:34.550> out<00:04:34.760> here

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
really hard to have to hold out here

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.580 
really hard to have to hold out here
until<00:04:35.120> around<00:04:35.450> like<00:04:35.600> 10<00:04:35.900> or<00:04:36.050> 12<00:04:36.080> him<00:04:36.500> to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
until around like 10 or 12 him to

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.290 
until around like 10 or 12 him to
actually<00:04:36.680> show<00:04:37.040> up<00:04:37.220> it's<00:04:37.820> really<00:04:38.090> difficult

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
actually show up it's really difficult

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.960 
actually show up it's really difficult
but<00:04:38.720> he<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.960> there<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.500> tossed<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.430> MP<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:40.880> we

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
but he is there I tossed the MP and we

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.570 
but he is there I tossed the MP and we
actually<00:04:41.300> did<00:04:41.450> do<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.750> step<00:04:41.960> now<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:46.340> heard

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
actually did do this step now you heard

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.490 
actually did do this step now you heard
him<00:04:46.700> he<00:04:46.820> said<00:04:47.000> he<00:04:47.090> needs<00:04:47.270> more<00:04:47.540> energy<00:04:47.750> now

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
him he said he needs more energy now

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.620 
him he said he needs more energy now
that<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.100> end<00:04:49.280> of<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:49.700> second<00:04:50.150> step<00:04:50.360> I

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
that is the end of this second step I

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.540 
that is the end of this second step I
hope<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:51.169> guys<00:04:51.350> kind<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.830> understand<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.400> is<00:04:52.520> a

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
hope you guys kind of understand it is a

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.220 
hope you guys kind of understand it is a
really<00:04:52.910> rough<00:04:53.120> step<00:04:53.390> it<00:04:53.540> took<00:04:53.630> me<00:04:53.780> forever<00:04:53.990> to

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
really rough step it took me forever to

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.440 
really rough step it took me forever to
do<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.919> we<00:04:55.130> actually<00:04:55.310> did<00:04:55.790> not<00:04:55.820> was<00:04:56.419> not

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
do this and we actually did not was not

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.600 
do this and we actually did not was not
able<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.960> complete<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.590> last<00:04:57.770> step<00:04:58.070> we're

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
able to complete the last step we're

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.010 
able to complete the last step we're
going<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:58.790> have<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.970> redo<00:04:59.300> this<00:04:59.480> step<00:04:59.780> and

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
going to have to redo this step and

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.230
