00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.870
 people who support it 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.760
 week has been written to my channel 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.280
 probably thanks to these too 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.790
 excellent words of error to a great friend 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 ray 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
 yes I was one of the twenty 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 winners of the contest dario moccia 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.500
 so if you haven't seen it yet there 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 I leave the link here in the information box 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.939
 on the short video I made for the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.859
 cooked and I'm at the point of my sculpture ok 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.720
 we can start with the readings 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 recommended this month later 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 waiting nine months 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 finally mom go and light 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.850
 gold a four-volume miniseries 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.469
 made by osamu tezuka set in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.719
 a historical period in which it seems really 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.790
 that men and demons differ hand in hand 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.530
 the story tells of archi maro un 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 young samurai who at birth 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 48 parts of the body were removed from 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 48 demons abandoned by their parents will come 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.289
 welcomed by a surgeon who 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 realizing the supernatural powers of the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.309
 samurai will decide to provide a body 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 artificial with which to defend itself e 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.090
 fight demons to regain possession 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 at the end of his own body a yakima 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 Russia will join the beginning 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.540
 small the trunk I praise them a little boy 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.729
 which you will immediately find out 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.890
 had a rather suffering past 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.299
 a simple dynamic and raw story 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490
 as a loser who served to sin 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.509
 from the beginning of his stories 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.430
 involving the reader in a set of 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.830
 plots and subplots and alternating moments 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.810
 of tension at moments of hilarity here 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.280
 demons appear really scary 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.619
 but perhaps they are much more so 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.240
 human beings who use them for 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.009
 achieve your goals in a way 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.420
 totally unprejudiced 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.490
 if you think the lord of the rings 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 of tolkien or the cd and of the foundation of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 asimov fused you to the brain 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.770
 then you have never tried the five 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.140
 star stories 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.270
 we are in the stellar mass of a joker 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.979
 corner of the universe composed of five 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 stars around which they rotate 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.149
 as many planets in a future 10,000 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.570
 years later than days 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.340
 our 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.290
 the story speaks of the attempt of the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.880
 amaterasu emperors an important one 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.590
 ruling 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.960
 of a state on the scoreboard planet 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.130
 to unify the star cluster that of 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.259
 end wars that it 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.119
 characterized for hundreds of years since 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.729
 military vote the clashes are 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.979
 represented by dead renders of robots 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.720
 gigantic for which 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.340
 optimal functioning are not 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.260
 enough of the skilled pilots called 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.209
 headliner but also interfaces 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.610
 human beings able to interact with them 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.560
 called fatima of biological automata 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
 in all respects similar to beings 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.330
 humans with long slashed shapes 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.250
 of beautiful girls particularity of this 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.290
 manga is the fact that history comes to us 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.060
 presented with its conclusion 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.519
 in fact the first chapter is nothing else 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.019
 that the end of the series itself is from here 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.690
 a journey into the future begins 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.010
 time to tell us about the adventures 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.890
 of the most important events 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.930
 occurred under the light of the 5 stars in 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.640
 this route is over 12,000 years old 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.920
 they are described to us in the least 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.380
 details and the birth and fall of 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.299
 empires reign in land the enterprises of 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.349
 knight heroes of scientists and 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.819
 epic battles 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.500
 the only problem is that reader will have to 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.390
 take charge of a spring and maybe a little 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.650
 too big and information that 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.390
 it is difficult to learn 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.459
 all at once to get a reading 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.000
 very fluid so it will be necessary to return 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.260
 at the beginning of the volume where we find 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.109
 this set of descriptions of 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.269
 characters that we will have to meet 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.250
 the beginning of the same volume or to the 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.620
 end where is the timeline of the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.780
 joker systems with various information 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.579
 concerning the composition of the storage 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.010
 of the stars and some insights 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.600
 linked to events that happened in 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.920
 volume just read a manga 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.840
 science fiction able to mix 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.090
 adventure fantasies in style 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.280
 medieval easily recognizable by a 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.650
 drawing in which the characterization of the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.690
 characters is not very elaborate but 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.730
 development will be extremely manic 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.940
 of spaceships and above all of the mecha 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.709
 design where the author will give greater vent 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.030
 to all his inspiration a story that is 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.410
 opens up endless possibilities and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.880
 many events 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.620
 who may never have one 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.360
 potential conclusion but not for 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.330
 this should not be read 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.350
 ep of naoki urasawa ends 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.120
 probably the work that can remain 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.830
 less the price of this author than us 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.460
 he's used to writing something else 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.840
 level 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.270
 the plot does not have many strokes of 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.010
 scene or large narrative architecture but 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.230
 is composed mostly of a sequence of 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.280
 exhausting and endless workouts 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.380
 tennis matches 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.240
 in fact the strong point of epinal and the 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.280
 plot more than anything the path of 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.630
 formation of the protagonist that for 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.519
 repay the millionaire debt of the 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.350
 brother will have to accumulate victories over 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.450
 victories and why not make his own 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.670
 biggest dream sports work but not 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.560
 only if it allows us to see the bond well 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.420
 with more profound and burly works e 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.950
 but the merit of the same author 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.050
 that of telling stories with a 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.210
 enviable lightness without giving up 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.070
 to a dense weave articulated into 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.660
 able to convey great emotions and 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.700
 pathos even for the most situations 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.530
 ordinary hayao miyazaki is now one 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.300
 figure known worldwide in the 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.310
 the world of animation that he knew 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.900
 passionate about a lot of generations 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.580
 talk about a new career 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.500
 this caliber is a long undertaking e 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.360
 arduous but passing through the events 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.220
 which most characterized it 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.260
 one can not fail to mention nausicaa of the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.880
 valley of wind excessive advancement of 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.800
 a civilization brought the world there 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.520
 ruin and between genetic manipulation and 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.440
 technology 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.570
 the entire world population has been 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.860
 almost completely decimated by wars and by 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.640
 natural collapse I had to 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.980
 pollution 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.140
 after several centuries and the few people 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.640
 remained gathered in villages and 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.120
 there was a kind of return to the 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.460
 origins 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.930
 the protagonist is sick to her daughter 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.390
 of a king of one of these villages who 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.919
 in fact it is located in the valley of the wind 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.630
 music is a girl who has a big one 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.340
 love for nature that will bring it 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.770
 often to visit the sea of 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.080
 putrefaction an immense wood it occupies 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.360
 a vast space on the planet where a 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.669
 insect and plant ecosystem itself 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.620
 evolved in motion in a way of its own 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.720
 thanks poisonous miasma away from 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.340
 human settlements despite the state 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.960
 the war continues to be painful to the world 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.510
 raging due to numerous 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.070
 conflicts between two major nations 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.600
 so a slow but continuous begins 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.430
 evolve of the story you will see 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.060
 alternating numerous antagonists 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.680
 allies to our music 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.169
 that will allow us to understand in a way 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.910
 very detailed evolution e 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.169
 the fate of our planet 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.120
 an intriguing story that touches 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.440
 very common themes in the works of 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.090
 this author such as the 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.950
 respect for nature or various 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.810
 aside from the war faced in 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.970
 very innovative and never boring 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.830
 leaving important value for the most 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.720
 young and interesting reflections for i 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.610
 biggest fan of everything 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.620
 what derives from it miyazaki places one 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.480
 great tension in the realization of the 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.190
 aircraft and warships that 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.540
 they are enhanced more respect 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.160
 all the rest 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.110
 despite this however we say that it 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.760
 minimalist style of faces will know 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.220
 be incredibly expressive and 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.930
 deep managing to transmit a lot 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.410
 more with images than with 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.510
 the words 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.550
 great return even for good night with 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.960
 points with this tenth volume enter 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.300
 presumably in his narrative arc 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.250
 final as the work will end 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.080
 with fourteen volumes an original 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.150
 story about childhood and adolescence e 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.680
 entry into adulthood but also one 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.240
 in-depth look at society 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.550
 Japanese all filtered through 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.260
 the eyes of a child to whom the author 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.630
 gave the appearance of a shilling 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.550
 assembled perhaps to accentuate the point 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.500
 dry and unprejudiced 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.210
 moral with which it faces the world that it 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.680
 surrounds despite having been 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.110
 deliberately designed in a manner 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.340
 simple and minimal and pon pon possesses 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.380
 a strong and eccentric one 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.419
 characterization and it is with this that 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.550
 will address very much in its own way 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.280
 the consequences are as delicate as sex 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.860
 of love domestic violence 7 am 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.599
 there 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.099
 in this volume we will find ours 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.930
 protagonist who will come again 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:19.210
 shocked by hesitation and 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.009
 insecurities will cause him to falter 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.689
 faced with choices that in themselves were 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.669
 unstable my mind yes 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:26.409
 they face the horizon but with the 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.300
 person who would have wanted more than anything 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.580
 having the future at its side seems 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.990
 March less than expected for the gossipers 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.669
 more hardened it seems that 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.449
 the author intends to change 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.400
 sex 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.199
 and after this series, start one 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.830
 new with the main theme 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:43.659
 transsexuality I would never have said 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.189
 well for this month too I concluded 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:47.620
 with recommended readings 

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:49.330
 as usual let me know if there is 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.069
 interested in something of what I have 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.259
 shown if you maybe even read it 

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:54.580
 you if there is something you might want 

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:57.340
 ask me leave you all the questions 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.770
 of the case we see soon with a 

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.639
 new video that will be very different 

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.139
 compared to those you normally do 

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:04.330
 public in this channel 

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:06.759
 I don't want to say more though we say 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.710
 which will be a nice surprise or otherwise 

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:11.469
 I hope you enjoy all those old men 

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.000
 like me, we see each other in this 

00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:15.240
 next video and the next hello a 

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.240
 all
