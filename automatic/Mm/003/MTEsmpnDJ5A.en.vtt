00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.970
 brooch the last time you had us 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.950
 shares an important discovery at 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.870
 about the life of the hair actually 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.000
 what I had shown was that the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 hair follicle hair existed under 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.400
 two states an active state a state of 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
 rest and it's during this phase 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.910
 rest that hair fall 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.500
 naturally just what we have 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 discovered is that after this phase of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.779
 rest for some loneliness there is a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.630
 dormancy phase during which the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.850
 follicle is empty and so it's crazy 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.950
 that the void represents a deficit of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 density is so in this period of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.530
 dormancy it can take how much 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.660
 time before a new show does 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.570
 push back then it can take 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 a few months to more than a year 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.110
 okay it can be very far it can 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.820
 to be very long but thankfully all 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.379
 the follicles are asynchronous so 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 overall at the level of the hair 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.820
 it's not it's not dramatic 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.050
 so when you have sparse hair 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.940
 that we lack density and understands 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.800
 a hair treatment must be held 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.510
 account of this delay so that's 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 fundamental 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.460
 the fire the hairy team it's an organ 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 living with its own dynamics and so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.840
 you really have to take into account this 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.450
 notion of time and if we want a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 effect are visible in a global way 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 on the hair one has to wait at 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 least three months but if for a reason 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.460
 or for another one interrupts this 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.410
 treatment is what we owe everything 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.970
 start again not actually 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.530
 after one month you have some 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.229
 number of follicles that have been 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.399
 awake for example if we take the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.149
 stem oxides inc is a molecule 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.119
 patented 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.610
 it will take three months to get 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.759
 a density increase of approximately 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.050
 1700 hair but if you have hair 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.759
 long it will take more time to a 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 visible I imagine surprisingly 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.700
 no actually the first follicles that 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.190
 are going to be reactivated that are going to be 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 wake up is on the edge of the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.070
 hair at the level of the temples at the level 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.460
 of the forehead and his entourage sees it all 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.040
 right now 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.909
 sometimes even before you agree so if 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.830
 we are really impatient 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.830
 the rewards exactly
