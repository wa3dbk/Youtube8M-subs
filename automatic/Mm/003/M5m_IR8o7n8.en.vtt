00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
one this week is 81 discipline we're

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.900 
one this week is 81 discipline we're
maxed<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.410> again<00:03:25.769> being<00:03:26.040> gauntlets<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.700> means

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
maxed and again being gauntlets it means

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.130 
maxed and again being gauntlets it means
the<00:03:27.030> lowest<00:03:27.330> you'll<00:03:27.480> ever<00:03:27.600> see<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:27.989> with

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the lowest you'll ever see this is with

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.199 
the lowest you'll ever see this is with
75<00:03:28.709> discipline<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.340> highest<00:03:30.120> you'll

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
75 discipline and the highest you'll

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.630 
75 discipline and the highest you'll
never<00:03:30.330> see<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.750> with<00:03:30.930> 113<00:03:31.800> discipline<00:03:32.160> so

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
never see this is with 113 discipline so

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.949 
never see this is with 113 discipline so
this<00:03:32.760> one<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.060> little<00:03:33.090> bit<00:03:33.330> low<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.840> end

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
this one is a little bit low on the end

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.270 
this one is a little bit low on the end
of<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.080> spectrum<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.680> unless<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.040> these

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
of the spectrum so unless you have these

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.920 
of the spectrum so unless you have these
with<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.519> much<00:03:35.730> lower<00:03:35.940> stat<00:03:36.239> rule<00:03:36.420> it's

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
with a much lower stat rule it's

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.240 
with a much lower stat rule it's
probably<00:03:37.200> not<00:03:37.470> worth<00:03:37.500> picking<00:03:37.769> these<00:03:37.950> up<00:03:38.010> if

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
probably not worth picking these up if

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.970 
probably not worth picking these up if
you<00:03:38.459> already<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.940> them<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:40.290> lastly<00:03:40.590> moving
