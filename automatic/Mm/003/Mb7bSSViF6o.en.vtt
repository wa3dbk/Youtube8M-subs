Bauer<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.980> descent<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.270> almost<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> same

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
Bauer first descent it's almost the same

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.520 
Bauer first descent it's almost the same
glove<00:01:01.379> doesn't<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:02.100> protection<00:01:02.789> across<00:01:03.530> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
glove doesn't have protection across the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.969 
glove doesn't have protection across the
the<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.460> fingers<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.350> curve<00:01:07.650> those

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the your fingers here as you curve those

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460 
the your fingers here as you curve those
so<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:09.240> would<00:01:09.479> still<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.290> ice

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so these would still be good for ice

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.280 
so these would still be good for ice
climbing<00:01:10.830> I'd<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.479> just<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.840> warm<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
climbing I'd say just not as warm so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
climbing I'd say just not as warm so
this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> very<00:01:14.130> early<00:01:14.490> season

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
them I will use them because I want to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.620 
them I will use them because I want to
make<00:02:01.469> sure<00:02:01.619> they're<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.070> waterproof

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
make sure they're going to be waterproof

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.139 
make sure they're going to be waterproof
as<00:02:03.630> much<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.110> possible<00:02:04.670> but<00:02:05.670> I've<00:02:05.820> been<00:02:05.969> up

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
as much as possible but I've been up

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.850 
as much as possible but I've been up
here<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.509> still<00:02:06.689> early<00:02:06.719> season<00:02:07.469> beginning

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
here it's still early season beginning

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.850 
here it's still early season beginning
of<00:02:08.009> January<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.840> snow<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.140> pretty<00:02:10.319> dry<00:02:10.619> here

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
of January the snow is pretty dry here

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.229 
of January the snow is pretty dry here
in<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> Front<00:02:11.250> Range<00:02:11.280> though<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.090> were

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
in the Front Range though if I were

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.240 
in the Front Range though if I were
really<00:02:12.569> spending<00:02:13.110> time<00:02:13.349> out

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
really spending time out

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460 
really spending time out
in<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.730> snow<00:02:14.940> getting<00:02:15.240> wet<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.050> kind<00:02:16.410> of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
in the snow getting wet and that kind of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.400 
in the snow getting wet and that kind of
stuff<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:17.790> think<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.900> they<00:02:19.020> would<00:02:19.140> probably

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
stuff I think that they would probably

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.440 
stuff I think that they would probably
begin<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.460> little<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:20.940> bit<00:02:21.210> wet

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
begin to get a little what bit wet

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.890 
begin to get a little what bit wet
especially<00:02:21.630> as<00:02:22.170> thin<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> I'm

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
especially as thin as they are so I'm

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.510 
especially as thin as they are so I'm
going<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.080> put<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> Nick<00:02:25.650> wax<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.100> them<00:02:26.340> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
going to put the Nick wax on them and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.800 
going to put the Nick wax on them and
just<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:26.760> sure<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.150> they're<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.660> be

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
just make sure that they're going to be

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.830 
just make sure that they're going to be
as<00:02:28.530> waterproof<00:02:28.920> as<00:02:29.310> possible<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.570> far<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
as waterproof as possible but so far I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.390 
as waterproof as possible but so far I
just<00:02:31.110> wanted<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.470> get<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.920> start<00:02:32.100> using

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
just wanted to get out and start using

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640 
just wanted to get out and start using
them<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.420> how<00:02:33.660> far<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.050> could<00:02:34.170> push<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
them and see how far I could push the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.190 
them and see how far I could push the
limits<00:02:35.010> before<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.430> started<00:02:35.880> feeling<00:02:36.200> any

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
limits before I started feeling any

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.260 
limits before I started feeling any
water<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:37.950> into<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.280> glove<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.910> haven't

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
water get into the glove and I haven't

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.420 
water get into the glove and I haven't
yet<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.630> who<00:02:40.560> knows<00:02:40.770> when<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.370> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
yet so who knows when that's going to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.490 
yet so who knows when that's going to
happen<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:41.850> I'm<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.150> gonna<00:02:42.360> not<00:02:43.200> gonna<00:02:43.350> wait

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
happen but I'm not gonna not gonna wait

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.780 
happen but I'm not gonna not gonna wait
for<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.800> happen<00:02:43.890> I'm<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.190> gonna<00:02:44.490> seal

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
for it to happen I'm just gonna seal

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.270 
for it to happen I'm just gonna seal
them<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:46.020> by<00:02:46.170> first<00:02:46.470> ascent<00:02:47.040> and
