form<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.090> exhaust<00:02:20.390> system<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.080> a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
form of the exhaust system it is a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.900 
form of the exhaust system it is a
ceramic<00:02:21.470> coated<00:02:22.040> system<00:02:22.430> we're<00:02:22.730> going<00:02:22.850> to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
ceramic coated system we're going to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.210 
ceramic coated system we're going to
show<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.570> just<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:24.200> moment<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:25.190> a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
show you in just a moment it is a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.540 
show you in just a moment it is a
ceramic<00:02:25.610> coated<00:02:26.090> system<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> powder

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
ceramic coated system with the powder

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.940 
ceramic coated system with the powder
coated<00:02:29.060> FMF<00:02:29.960> muffler<00:02:30.470> put<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.340> reverse

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.540 

neutral<00:02:37.650> reverse

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.480 

so<00:02:43.030> what<00:02:43.270> do<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.390> think<00:02:43.570> about<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:44.020> sound

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
so what do you think about this sound

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.900 
so what do you think about this sound
take<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.520> closer<00:02:45.880> look<00:02:46.060> at<00:02:46.390> it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.930 

now<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.190> parking<00:02:54.190> brake<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.520> really

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
now the parking brake is really

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:07.260 
now the parking brake is really
convenient<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.710> Ural<00:02:56.920> motorcycle

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.020 

very<00:03:07.870> very<00:03:08.530> very<00:03:08.920> good<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.400> healthy<00:03:09.610> sound

very very very good and healthy sound

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.220 
very very very good and healthy sound
from<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.770> exhaust<00:03:11.770> system<00:03:12.120> okay<00:03:15.510> now<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.900> far

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
from this exhaust system okay now as far

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.020 
from this exhaust system okay now as far
as<00:03:18.480> as<00:03:19.480> far<00:03:19.780> as<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.830> shifter<00:03:21.220> we<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.880> two

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
levers we have one lever right here this

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.610 
levers we have one lever right here this
is<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.430> put<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> bike<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.110> out<00:03:29.440> of
