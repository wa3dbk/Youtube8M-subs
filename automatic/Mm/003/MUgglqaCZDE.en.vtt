00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.060
 when I look at a phase I feel 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.009
 always to shoot small details 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.590
 in a phase that seems to me to be pretty 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.869
 is interesting technically so 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.579
 seals a slab winzip or a 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.100
 chain of boats and pretty and then 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.559
 in general on mountain always always 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.199
 a line that really stands out 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.790
 really speaks and that's really 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.699
 something personal and so that's 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.409
 important is to know that we love this 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.089
 we know how to do what we can do 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.809
 are our limits to be able to be well 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.809
 choose your line 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.270
 the study of the quality of the snow and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
 snow conditions are really the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.800
 the predominant clippers for the pro 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.610
 choosing a nice ashes of time 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.869
 in time the conditions are little mean 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.460
 where we want to these plugs so 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.770
 it's good to work on lines 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.130
 short with clean outlets one can 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.020
 really go get the actions 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.540
 really engaged and so on and then 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.340
 after stronger and no longer 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.799
 explorers we do not want to go 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.060
 on big lines that sees himself 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.799
 that they are afraid that they ask and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.000
 perfect collection that requires a 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.720
 study at the approximate level of the carats 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.720
 do not trust too much 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.770
 in fact there are several that there is a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.219
 phase we know it's purely calculation 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.649
 in the fed it's really students 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.179
 of self that on that side there there and I 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.159
 think that's really what the 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.990
 judged a little bit the football remained 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.390
 so that is to evaluate very 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.429
 pragmatic and after once everything 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.299
 it is well stalled face we have a plan that 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.250
 is concrete I thought more than the side 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.110
 emotional who takes over when he 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.759
 ya everything is saved in the head 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.259
 I am personally 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.090
 a lot but line before doing them 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.170
 we know that I imagine a little bit in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.470
 all the senses and it's a little bit 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.849
 like that we really have its reach neither 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.220
 and the more we will spend this time 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.410
 think about visualizing a little bit the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.140
 descent and less we will need 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.519
 do not think yet we will help and that's 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.970
 where the best is and that's where we 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.970
 know that the first 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.570
 I
