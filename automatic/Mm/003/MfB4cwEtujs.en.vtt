00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
your guitar to D minor would be D F and

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.220 
your guitar to D minor would be D F and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
minor third which is f natural then we

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.319 
minor third which is f natural then we
have<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:44.200> we<00:03:45.190> have<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.459> four<00:03:45.730> in<00:03:45.880> its<00:03:46.030> place

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.430 
have and we have the four in its place
which<00:03:46.720> is<00:03:46.900> G<00:03:47.700> we<00:03:48.700> now<00:03:48.880> have<00:03:49.170> suspended<00:03:50.170> the

which is G we now have suspended the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.259 
which is G we now have suspended the
major<00:03:50.650> or<00:03:50.980> minor<00:03:51.190> third<00:03:51.579> there<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.880> no<00:03:52.060> more

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
major or minor third there is no more

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.539 
major or minor third there is no more
third<00:03:52.599> but<00:03:53.590> there's<00:03:53.769> still<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.950> fourth<00:03:54.280> and

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
third but there's still a fourth and

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.470 
third but there's still a fourth and
that<00:03:54.750> counts<00:03:55.750> as<00:03:55.930> three<00:03:56.410> different<00:03:57.220> notes<00:03:57.579> so

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
that counts as three different notes so

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.630 
that counts as three different notes so
when<00:03:58.569> you're<00:03:58.720> playing<00:03:58.959> this<00:03:59.260> open<00:03:59.890> is

when you're playing this open is

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.610 
when you're playing this open is
technically<00:04:01.410> de<00:04:02.410> sus<00:04:02.950> 4<00:04:03.519> that's<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.810> chord<00:04:05.140> is

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
technically de sus 4 that's the chord is

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.309 
technically de sus 4 that's the chord is
cheap<00:04:06.010> C<00:04:06.190> naturally<00:04:06.640> so<00:04:07.299> wherever<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.750> are<00:04:07.780> it

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
cheap C naturally so wherever you are it

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.339 
cheap C naturally so wherever you are it
is<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.650> sus<00:04:09.100> 4

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
is a sus 4

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.709 
is a sus 4

now we have a chord that we have a
tuning<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.490> has<00:05:15.700> three<00:05:16.000> notes<00:05:16.180> which<00:05:16.810> is

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
tuning that has three notes which is

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.420 
tuning that has three notes which is
technically<00:05:17.410> important<00:05:17.920> three<00:05:18.130> different

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
technically important three different

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.700 
technically important three different
notes<00:05:18.610> but<00:05:19.570> it's<00:05:19.720> neither<00:05:19.900> major<00:05:20.170> or<00:05:20.530> minor

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
notes but it's neither major or minor

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.040 
notes but it's neither major or minor
and<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.120> course<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.630> should<00:05:22.750> give<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:22.990> a

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
and so of course that should give you a

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.920 
and so of course that should give you a
hint<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:24.160> how<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.760> handle<00:05:25.180> us<00:05:25.360> at<00:05:25.570> this<00:05:25.810> point

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
hint to how to handle us at this point

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.320 
hint to how to handle us at this point
and<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:27.190> have<00:05:27.400> another<00:05:27.640> lesson<00:05:28.000> you'll<00:05:28.120> have<00:05:28.240> to

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
and I have another lesson you'll have to

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.310 
and I have another lesson you'll have to
search<00:05:28.570> for<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:30.720> will<00:05:31.720> give<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.170> a<00:05:32.200> little

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
search for that will give you a little

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.170 
search for that will give you a little
more<00:05:32.500> insight<00:05:32.680> into<00:05:32.920> how<00:05:33.280> to<00:05:33.310> approach<00:05:33.790> this

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
more insight into how to approach this

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.870 
more insight into how to approach this
tuning<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:35.080> play<00:05:35.320> it<00:05:35.470> but<00:05:36.070> that's<00:05:36.190> my<00:05:36.460> theory

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
tuning to play it but that's my theory

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.480 
tuning to play it but that's my theory
on<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.360> dadgad<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.170> there's<00:05:38.980> more<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.430> it

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
on the dadgad and there's more to it

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.490 
on the dadgad and there's more to it
than<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.700> but<00:05:40.090> this<00:05:40.150> is<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.360> beginning<00:05:41.230> to

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
than that but this is a beginning to

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.960 
than that but this is a beginning to
understand<00:05:42.010> it<00:05:42.130> I'm<00:05:42.340> sure<00:05:42.550> this<00:05:42.700> will<00:05:42.820> help

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
understand it I'm sure this will help

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.400 
understand it I'm sure this will help
you<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.270> give<00:05:43.450> you<00:05:43.480> some<00:05:43.720> insight<00:05:43.900> this<00:05:44.350> is
