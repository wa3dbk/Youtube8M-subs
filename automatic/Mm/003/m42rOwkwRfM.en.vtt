00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.379
You  know for me I'm always going to think about her because that image is just

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.599
you know one that's always etched into your brain that you're always going think about

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.759
when you see enameled suffered so much

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.950
In July of 2011 we were called in by the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.230
Gary, Indiana sheriff's department to assist them with a dog fighting raid

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.149
this is a very significant dogfighting
operation with

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.160
a pit for them to fight them in a carpet rolled out

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.250
that was covered in blood including blood splattered on the walls

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.489
break sticks lying in the middle and
bloody towels

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.469
that were laying on the ground of a recent fight

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.579
as I came out the back door of the house
I see this

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.790
little tan dog just huddled up and I can see she had

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.909
a really extensive injury to her face
she's missing a large piece of her

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.729
lip right there

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.920
it's likely that it occurred during a fight

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.259
when they breed dogs like at that age, they're retiring them basically

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.259
to make more profit

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.560
a dog with these types of injuries at her
age had seen a lot of fights over

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.200
over her years and had proven that she
could keep her life

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.800
in order to make them more money

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.940
I really wasn't sure that she would be able to

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.710
trust a human again but after 20 minutes

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.270
she was like a whole nother dog

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.720
I think she just really needed to know that this time

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.330
when somebody approached her and somebody came to get her

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.220
that it was somebody who was
friendly and not gonna cause her the same

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.810
harm

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.450
suffering that she had known before

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.610
She's gonna be alright

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.300
for me it's one of the most amazing
feelings to promise her that she's never

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.800
gonna have to go back here again

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.170
and that her days of suffering are over

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.040
is something that will you never forget
once you've been a part of something

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.620
like this

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.780
the Humane Society of the United States is working to stop all forms of animal cruelty

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.780
please be a hero for the animals make a
special holiday gift to help support our

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.660
work in 2012
