 lilliput 7-inch gentlemen today 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.509
 I want to talk about another little one 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.840
 object that I bought rich costs 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.270
 it is 7 inch lilliput 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 then first of all you are already 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.800
 evident to my right is always there always 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.199
 in operation or her 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
 let's talk about the device and its features first 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.600
 its features then this 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.739
 screen is a 7-inch screen time 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.960
 the model in question is 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.940
 unpronounceable I tell you with the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.079
 model sections and I'll write it down below 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:48.000
 at a weight of one kilo and a half display 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.940
 opaque led with a zar 501 ratio 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 the monitor and cd is obviously at sixteen 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.520
 the inputs are hdmi is another than 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.770
 I do not pronounce it because I have arrived 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.170
 pignoli explain to me how it says want 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.409
 say weapons as enough and has one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.229
 maximum resolution of full hd ie 1900 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.760
 20 of these are the law rotana 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.320
 its dimensions 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.630
 the price if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.610
 if I am not mistaken, it set aside 145 euros 175 euros 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.820
 beyond this also the attacks I ask 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:26.320
 excuse also the RCA input attacks 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.610
 audio and also the speakers incorporated beyond 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.540
 this pairing the menu or or queue 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.210
 words to change light contrast has 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.479
 This ten many more options a monitor 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.369
 150 euros monitor 24 inches 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.460
 this is where these monitors are almost 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.149
 especially ridiculous as if from 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.759
 external ring as well you have understood it well 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.470
 grandmothers were studied for post la 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.289
 what more are you seeing behind me 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.660
 but the most have been studied 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.369
 for video cameras and cameras 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.619
 weaving I have understood why 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.830
 if you find yourself outside and I had 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:11.650
 need a screen that is not of 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.600
 that wordiness of fencing to Lacan 16 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.570
 of must always with you are talking 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.080
 just go and watch boxing in there 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:28.440
 post unboxing that the groom and the of the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.440
 home are heard tv come 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.610
 so you can also say 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.500
 and the power supply does not 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.010
 only the electricity grid to me also a 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.550
 battery battery that is not installed 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.650
 automatically in the screen but you have to 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.650
 install it yourself with small and simple 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.630
 passages that is really simple is about 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.820
 a truly disarming simplicity 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.490
 video quality really is really 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.070
 really good over this the reason 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.020
 for only complete because I can use it 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:13.100
 with a hdmi attack of the three names of 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.830
 hdmi from hdmi and mini hdmi on mine 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.800
 SLR camera consumes beauty though 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.220
 I am not 10 watts less than 10 watts 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.050
 this means seeing that I only live in the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.960
 bills you have to pay everything 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.260
 I am forced to minimize everything e 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.250
 for all the expenses not only for how much 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.960
 it concerns cooking, etc., etc. but 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.100
 also on the species of the current is 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.320
 even those 10 15 watts more do the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.709
 difference on a person's bill 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.270
 which unfortunately he pays the bills he knows 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.770
 when he consumes all things that he does not 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.570
 mum and dad's children know or who 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.180
 he still lives with his parents of course 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.220
 I also bought it for this reason I have 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.200
 bought because we saw ours 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.830
 often at the computer not many hours at 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.810
 computer 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.120
 I tend to always blame a 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.420
 put me of the company or not people 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.940
 at home I don't live with anyone and therefore 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.320
 as a company or TV movie and stuff 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.820
 of the kind in this period I am 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.370
 reviewing from the first smallville series 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.470
 to give you the example, however, the cons of 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.970
 there are none on this screen 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.420
 also found a 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.990
 a small let's say metal support 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.510
 where to say let's keep firm as 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.850
 you are seeing the monitor 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.070
 the only flaw is that at one stage too 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:41.360
 small then if you keep it straight or 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:44.360
 slightly inclined towards the front 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.810
 monitor does not fall as soon as it tends to 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.420
 have a slight inclination 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.900
 higher both forward and backward 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.690
 even with that small base the monitor 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.820
 tends to fall so I had to put 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.590
 in front of his feet since he must be 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.930
 inclined towards my gaze and not 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.270
 towards you for thesis towards you is 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.200
 cool but for me there is no fucking 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.120
 utility 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.220
 then to keep them tilted towards the 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.930
 my gaze I had to put is 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.940
 inclined in this manner due 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.450
 put scotch tape to hold it in place 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.610
 if not every three minutes every 2 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.550
 minutes every second in the mouth words on 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.460
 horse back I think I have not 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.520
 found defects there is in the sense for the 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.840
 work that makes a contrast to one 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.300
 light a brightness a consumption and it is 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.150
 it is truly perfect in everything 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.830
 really good in everything 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.600
 I found no flaw I don't know I wanted 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.360
 a Polish and with the flaw is that 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.450
 I wanted a Polish one Romanian for one 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.450
 beautiful week and bon and possibly
