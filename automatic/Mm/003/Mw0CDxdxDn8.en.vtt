00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello to all and I hope you 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.480
 be well 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.580
 today I'm coming back with a video 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.020
 very flowery tutorial but not very 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.910
 a long time I bought a bouquet of 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.199
 pastel roses and I'm very keen to 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.730
 reproduce them on my nails in 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.730
 two-colored in purple and white 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.680
 for those born there I used the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.330
 technique of go and stroke so I'm 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.460
 served with a flat brush simmered 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.200
 the mark rubles of that I'm going soaked 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.489
 half in the white paint and 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 half in purple paint 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.140
 I will then melt these two 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.909
 colors by degrading the brush on my 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.559
 palette and I'm going to pick from the 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.010
 painting if necessary if it lacks 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.570
 not quote 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.339
 so you have to count at least five or 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.469
 six times to have a nice gradient on 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.820
 the brush 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.439
 I'm here to simplify the movement of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.789
 rhÃ´ne troquant tapping and not in 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:00.780
 continuous as is the case for some 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.979
 other nail art 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.750
 you will see that it is much more 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.270
 easy to do if you start hello 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.490
 and stroke which is really 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.110
 tap the brush on the spot while 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.520
 realizing a beautiful curvy what is 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 very important to achieve a fatal 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 it's to look at the top of the petal that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.119
 you're going to have to do it 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.299
 a nice round on the top and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 normally the ball will follow alone 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.149
 I then realized a flora we serve 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.409
 so if you start below that I 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.670
 recommends that you only do 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 three-petalled flowers in the corner 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.909
 it's really easier for people 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.179
 whole flowers so these are five petals 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.470
 which are arranged fairly uniformly 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.530
 around the same center 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.209
 so that comes with training it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.310
 must leave a gap between each 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.350
 stall otherwise you will put six petals 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.420
 instead of five and so the petals are going 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 to be a little tighter the better it is to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.869
 you train to ten spent dispatcher 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.349
 five points for example around a same 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.929
 center 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.129
 it's really going to help you and after that it's 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.209
 really hack ie 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.519
 than at the second layer if we have them 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.739
 proofs of proportions that's the hints that 

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:00.420
 is going to be to enlarge a petal that is going 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.729
 to be too small or even to scratch 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.019
 a fatal that will be dry painting 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.619
 acrylic scratch very well once 

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.149
 that she is dry 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.250
 you can very well scratch or 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.700
 clean a petal if ever there is 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.700
 failed 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.260
 I take a fine brush here 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.810
 brush rubles of tai 00 to achieve 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.580
 small lines in the center of my 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.840
 petals so for that I vehicle and of 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.790
 very white acrylic paint 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.230
 diluted and I am well refined the tip 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.150
 of my brush to draw a line 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.040
 very fine and then I will come by 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.629
 jogging traced small lines that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.780
 will join a little center there 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.920
 do not really need to be supported 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.569
 it's normal if we make little ones 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.680
 balls that some traits do not mark 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.900
 not that's how you go 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.190
 get small filaments and so I 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.480
 will do as well on the flora 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.480
 whole than on the flora or what 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.030
 i take then world hawtin all the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.830
 8 to make two very small peas 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.640
 that I'm going to circle in the center 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.640
 of my flowers 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.850
 after arranging some peas 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.760
 near my flowers I'm going 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.380
 apply a layer of top coat and 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.910
 this is this tutorial henin finish I you 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.830

 to join me on social networks if 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.210
 you do not want poserne that would allow 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.210
 all the links at the bar of a pro see you soon
