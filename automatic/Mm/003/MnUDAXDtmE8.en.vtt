to take another look at it

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.010 
to take another look at it

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
see if it still is capable of blowing us

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.379 
see if it still is capable of blowing us
away<00:01:20.139> as<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.889> was<00:01:21.069> back<00:01:21.369> when<00:01:21.609> it<00:01:21.759> replaced<00:01:22.029> the

away as it was back when it replaced the
hurricane<00:01:22.959> it<00:01:23.679> just<00:01:23.889> feels<00:01:24.130> like<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.399> treat<00:01:24.729> to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.690 
hurricane it just feels like a treat to
get<00:01:24.939> on<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.270> it's<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.920> something<00:01:27.189> somebody

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
get on it it's it's something somebody

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.249 
get on it it's it's something somebody
who<00:01:27.880> did<00:01:28.270> something<00:01:28.600> really<00:01:28.779> right<00:01:29.049> when<00:01:29.200> they

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
who did something really right when they

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.569 
who did something really right when they
put<00:01:29.439> this<00:01:29.560> thing<00:01:29.619> together<00:01:29.829> I<00:01:30.099> think<00:01:30.249> it<00:01:30.459> took

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
put this thing together I think it took

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.639 
put this thing together I think it took
somebody<00:01:30.909> just<00:01:31.060> about<00:01:31.240> my<00:01:31.450> size<00:01:31.719> and<00:01:32.109> you<00:01:32.560> know

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
somebody just about my size and you know

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.379 
somebody just about my size and you know
built<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.069> perfect<00:01:33.219> motorcycle<00:01:33.939> around<00:01:34.029> it

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
built the perfect motorcycle around it

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.779 
built the perfect motorcycle around it
in<00:01:34.539> terms<00:01:34.749> of<00:01:35.249> combination<00:01:36.249> of<00:01:36.340> comfort<00:01:36.700> and

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
in terms of combination of comfort and

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.089 
in terms of combination of comfort and
handing<00:01:37.060> ability<00:01:37.389> and<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:37.719> on<00:01:37.899> it's<00:01:38.109> three

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
handing ability and so on it's three

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.649 
handing ability and so on it's three
years<00:01:39.219> on<00:01:39.459> and<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.729> other<00:01:39.819> manufacturers<00:01:40.329> are

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
years on and the other manufacturers are

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.879 
years on and the other manufacturers are
just<00:01:41.079> catching<00:01:41.409> up<00:01:41.649> to<00:01:41.829> it<00:01:41.950> really<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.740> make

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
just catching up to it really some make

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.379 
just catching up to it really some make
a<00:01:44.919> little<00:01:45.130> more<00:01:45.249> horsepower<00:01:45.669> now<00:01:45.909> but<00:01:46.179> they're

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
a little more horsepower now but they're

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.059

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 

actually<00:02:04.230> it<00:02:04.290> has<00:02:04.410> quite<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:04.980> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
actually it has quite a lot of

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.490 
actually it has quite a lot of
horsepower<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.850> did<00:02:06.330> ride<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.690> 750<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.410> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
horsepower I did ride the 750 in the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.340 
horsepower I did ride the 750 in the
past<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.820> say<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.240> has<00:02:09.510> every

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
past and I would say that this has every

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.390 
past and I would say that this has every
bit<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.710> much<00:02:11.280> horsepower<00:02:11.880> as<00:02:12.210> my<00:02:12.390> 750<00:02:12.990> had<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
bit as much horsepower as my 750 had and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.040 
bit as much horsepower as my 750 had and
it<00:02:14.400> has<00:02:14.550> more<00:02:14.820> horsepower<00:02:15.060> than<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.840> think<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
it has more horsepower than I think you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.960 
it has more horsepower than I think you
could<00:02:16.260> ever<00:02:16.380> use<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.890> street<00:02:17.130> if<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.700> were

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
could ever use on the street if you were

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.460 
could ever use on the street if you were

sort of fiddle know that sometimes to

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.660

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
make it go off but that's really about

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.270 
make it go off but that's really about
the<00:04:13.970> only<00:04:14.000> control<00:04:14.540> thing<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.930> had<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.710> agree

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
the only control thing I had and I agree

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.650 
the only control thing I had and I agree
that<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.459> fuel<00:04:16.670> gauge<00:04:16.700> you'd<00:04:17.000> be<00:04:17.090> nice<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.540> know

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
that a fuel gauge you'd be nice you know

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.300 
that a fuel gauge you'd be nice you know
for<00:04:17.900> more<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.470> street<00:04:18.650> oriented<00:04:19.010> bike<00:04:19.160> it

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
for more of a street oriented bike it

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.070 
for more of a street oriented bike it
would<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.519> pleasant<00:04:19.850> they<00:04:20.120> have<00:04:20.299> more<00:04:20.690> useful

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
would be pleasant they have more useful

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.570 
would be pleasant they have more useful
probably<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.470> temperature<00:04:21.860> gauge<00:04:22.010> really<00:04:22.460> a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
probably the temperature gauge really a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.980 
probably the temperature gauge really a
grand<00:04:22.940> scheme<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.240> things<00:04:23.300> I've<00:04:23.630> never<00:04:23.720> seen

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
grand scheme of things I've never seen

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.480 
grand scheme of things I've never seen
one<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.170> these<00:04:24.230> things<00:04:24.410> overheat<00:04:24.890> so<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.340> might

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
one of these things overheat so it might

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.210 
one of these things overheat so it might
be<00:04:25.670> a<00:04:25.700> might<00:04:26.150> be<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.270> nice<00:04:26.480> thing<00:04:26.720> but<00:04:27.220> other

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
be a might be a nice thing but other

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.610 
be a might be a nice thing but other
than<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.790> really<00:04:29.420> is<00:04:29.660> typical<00:04:30.080> Honda<00:04:30.470> in

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
than that it really is typical Honda in

than that it really is typical Honda in
that<00:04:30.800> tip<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:32.000> might<00:04:32.150> take<00:04:32.420> a<00:04:32.450> leave<00:04:32.690> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
that tip you might take a leave the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.480 
that tip you might take a leave the
color<00:04:33.020> scheme<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.500> know<00:04:33.710> some<00:04:33.950> people<00:04:34.190> like<00:04:34.340> the

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
color scheme I know some people like the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.100 
color scheme I know some people like the
real<00:04:34.610> bright<00:04:34.940> colors<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.480> splashes<00:04:35.990> and

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
real bright colors and splashes and

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.930 
real bright colors and splashes and
others<00:04:36.350> don't<00:04:36.620> but<00:04:36.800> it's<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.610> know<00:04:37.640> it's<00:04:37.820> all

well applied it all lines up properly
the<00:04:40.100> way<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.340> should<00:04:41.080> yeah<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.170> really<00:04:42.440> like<00:04:42.620> the
