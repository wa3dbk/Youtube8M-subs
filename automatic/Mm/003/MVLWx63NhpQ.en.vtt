00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.920

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.530
 you just have to say their name so the cwa 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.129
 soheila senators so here is in my 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
 riding stable 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.520
 they are inseparable and so the theme 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.520
 of the contest it's going to be that if not the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.600
 participants i would like 5 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.760
 I 'm expecting 5.5 participants 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 your video as soon as you can 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 comment to tell me that you want 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.809
 participate in my contest and well you 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.430
 can bring out your video and once 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.780
 that your video is out that would be 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.820
 nice to put me another comment 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.890
 to warn me is going right that you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.830
 have made your video as wise for 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.439
 go see her and I could notte 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.369
 so according to some criteria so already 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.630
 your video must be a real video 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.610
 because I said it must not be a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.259
 slideshow with consecutive photos 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.909
 and texts that are typed in 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.069
 computer 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.479
 and who appear would like it to be 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.039
 but you which hear your 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.630
 voice not that it's a real video 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.630
 like what I'm doing 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.729
 there too it would be nice if in 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.670
 your video there is a little bit of 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.350
 twists 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.209
 so that beats for the video 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.829
 be fun to watch whether it's 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.920
 pleasant or at a standstill we are not bored 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.740
 especially other criteria also the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.140
 brightness of the video would like that 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.719
 your video is not too dark or 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.920
 too enlightened that's because if it's 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.909
 too fast and I tried we see nothing 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.129
 after oh there there too the duration of the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.799
 video your video must last between two 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:06.259
 and five minutes 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.920
 so that's three four minutes this is 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.470
 the ideal is also I would not like 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.549
 do not see your fingers 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 there are also prices so he 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.200
 there will be prices so even if you are 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.180
 fifth so in this case last 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.700
 you will have a price anyway so my 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.500
 the price is not money but it 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.540
 could be comments from 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.540
 pushes towards subscribers maybe too 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.180
 so if you ever have questions 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.190
 about the contest because it may be that 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.230
 on some topics I have not been very 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.480
 clear so if you ever have any 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.200
 questions you put a comment and 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.380
 trap that to clear you up 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.910
 So here I am, I think I told you 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.419
 given all the information on the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.340
 contest so if not I also had some 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.630
 little information to give you 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.040
 already it is that as you have been able to 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.790
 to see my equestrian center 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.790
 completely changed 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:09.200
 it's not at all the same as before 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.590
 so the new visit is for 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.190
 soon 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.660
 1 as soon as the outline of that the contest 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.190
 will be finished I will leave my new visit 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.250
 that's also in the last 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.450
 presentation of cee I told you 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.160
 that I will soon make a series is well 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.200
 the mom series actually I have the idea of 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.520
 scenario so once I would have 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.980
 came out of my equestrian center 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.350
 down I will start to ask on to work 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.740
 by no on the series and then you 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.940
 would have said if not very long 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.770
 here I gave you all the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.230
 information about the equestrian center and 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.240
 so on the contest so well I hope 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.240
 that my contest will help you if 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.230

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.230
 kiss and see you soon
