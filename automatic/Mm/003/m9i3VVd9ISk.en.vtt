some<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> other<00:00:44.730> bar<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> rotor

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
some more to the other bar for the rotor

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
some more to the other bar for the rotor
I've<00:00:46.649> cut<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.039> round<00:00:47.399> plastic<00:00:47.760> disc<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
I've cut this round plastic disc and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 
I've cut this round plastic disc and
stick<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> needle<00:00:49.500> through<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.520> putting<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
stick a needle through it by putting the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.369 
stick a needle through it by putting the
sharp<00:00:51.210> end<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> needle<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> tiny

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
sharp end of the needle in the tiny

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.439 
sharp end of the needle in the tiny
indentation<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> help<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
indentation and with the help of the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.569 
indentation and with the help of the
magnetic<00:00:54.840> fields<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.800> needle<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.370> sits

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
magnetic fields the needle just sits

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
magnetic fields the needle just sits
there<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> turns<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:58.050> easily<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> disc

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
there and turns very easily but the disc

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
there and turns very easily but the disc
is<00:00:59.640> unbalanced<00:01:00.359> always<00:01:00.989> coming<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.530> stop

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is unbalanced always coming to a stop

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.520 
is unbalanced always coming to a stop
with<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> same<00:01:02.489> side<00:01:02.760> down<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> sand<00:01:04.379> away

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
with the same side down so I sand away

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.800 
with the same side down so I sand away
some<00:01:04.860> plastic<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.670> song<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.510> still

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
some plastic from that song it still

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.740 
some plastic from that song it still
isn't<00:01:06.960> balanced<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> sand<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.090> until

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
isn't balanced so I sand some more until

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
isn't balanced so I sand some more until
finally<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> rotor<00:01:10.650> stays<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.369> much

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
finally the rotor stays pretty much

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.090 
finally the rotor stays pretty much
however<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.119> oriented<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> start<00:01:13.890> cutting

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
however I oriented then I start cutting

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
however I oriented then I start cutting
up<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> coffee<00:01:14.670> bag<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.630> cut<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> strip<00:01:16.350> from

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
up the coffee bag and cut a strip from

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
up the coffee bag and cut a strip from
it<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.159> strip<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> half<00:01:17.820> inch<00:01:18.090> wide<00:01:18.330> by<00:01:18.689> two

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it the strip is a half inch wide by two

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
it the strip is a half inch wide by two
and<00:01:19.140> 1/8<00:01:19.380> inches<00:01:19.710> long<00:01:19.979> piece<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.850> duct<00:01:21.090> tape

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and 1/8 inches long piece of duct tape

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
and 1/8 inches long piece of duct tape
holds<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.810> onto<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> disc<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> attach

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
holds it onto the disc then I attach

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
holds it onto the disc then I attach
another<00:01:23.909> piece<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.840> make<00:01:25.049> sure<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.560> both

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
another piece and make sure they both

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.289 
another piece and make sure they both
stretch<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.520> same<00:01:26.729> distance<00:01:27.060> from<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
stretch out the same distance from the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.510 
stretch out the same distance from the
center<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.140> notice<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.770> petal<00:01:29.159> always

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
center but notice that one petal always

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
center but notice that one petal always
hangs<00:01:29.790> down<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> whole<00:01:31.049> thing<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
hangs down so the whole thing is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.679 
hangs down so the whole thing is
unbalanced<00:01:32.220> after<00:01:32.880> trimming<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.270> little<00:01:33.509> from

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
unbalanced after trimming a little from

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
unbalanced after trimming a little from
the<00:01:33.720> pedal<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.259> was<00:01:34.380> hanging<00:01:34.680> down<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the pedal that was hanging down the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.789 
the pedal that was hanging down the
rotor<00:01:35.850> balance<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> better<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.200> give<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
rotor balance is better now I give the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
rotor balance is better now I give the
pedals<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:38.460> curvature<00:01:38.880> using<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
pedals a little curvature using the

the cold air surrounding the glass
containing<00:01:57.869> cold<00:01:58.079> water<00:01:58.350> eventually<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.520> add

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
containing cold water eventually I add

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.120 
containing cold water eventually I add
all<00:02:00.090> eight<00:02:00.420> petals<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.469> notice<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> since

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
all eight petals but notice that since

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.280 
all eight petals but notice that since
it's<00:02:02.310> now<00:02:02.490> heavier<00:02:02.909> I've<00:02:03.329> also<00:02:03.600> had<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.140> add

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it's now heavier I've also had to add

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.270 
it's now heavier I've also had to add
more<00:02:04.320> magnets

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
more magnets

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.400 
more magnets
and<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.940> you'd<00:02:06.180> expect<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.960> rotor<00:02:07.170> is

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
and as you'd expect the rotor is

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.469 
and as you'd expect the rotor is
unbalanced<00:02:08.070> again<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> same<00:02:09.149> side

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
unbalanced again with the same side

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.080 
unbalanced again with the same side
always<00:02:09.929> hanging<00:02:10.229> down<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.830> fix<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> time

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
always hanging down to fix it this time

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
always hanging down to fix it this time
I<00:02:12.390> had<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> little<00:02:12.810> extra<00:02:13.050> tape<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.740> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I had a little extra tape on the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.220 
I had a little extra tape on the
opposite<00:02:14.190> side<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.820> now<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.630> stays<00:02:15.840> put

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
opposite side and now it stays put

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.890 
opposite side and now it stays put
wherever<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.740> leave<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.700> balanced<00:02:18.360> after

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
wherever I leave it it's balanced after

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.810 
wherever I leave it it's balanced after
using<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.290> scissors<00:02:19.680> again<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.370> give<00:02:20.550> all<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
using the scissors again to give all the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.660 
using the scissors again to give all the
petals<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.270> curvature<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.990> give<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.680> try<00:02:22.860> all

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
petals of curvature I give it a try all

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.670 
petals of curvature I give it a try all
that<00:02:24.030> careful<00:02:24.510> measuring<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.080> balancing<00:02:25.560> is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that careful measuring and balancing is

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.520 
that careful measuring and balancing is
paid<00:02:25.890> off<00:02:26.070> as<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.700> works<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.120> first<00:02:27.150> time<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
paid off as it works the first time you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.260 
paid off as it works the first time you
can<00:02:28.709> see<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> petals<00:02:29.370> straighten<00:02:29.880> out<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
can see the petals straighten out on the
