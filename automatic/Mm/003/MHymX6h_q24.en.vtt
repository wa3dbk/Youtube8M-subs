team<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.320> season<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.770> played<00:00:44.190> with

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
team in the season I played with

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.979 
team in the season I played with
cristianos<00:00:44.820> team<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> year<00:00:45.239> what's<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
cristianos team of the year what's the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
cristianos team of the year what's the
difference<00:00:46.110> between<00:00:46.379> them<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.149> nothing

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
difference between them and nothing

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
difference between them and nothing
they're<00:00:48.809> exactly<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.530> same<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.160> thing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
they're exactly the same but the thing

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.220 
they're exactly the same but the thing
is<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.640> thought<00:00:51.000> Ronaldo's<00:00:51.809> team<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> year

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
is I thought Ronaldo's team of the year
was<00:00:52.559> absolutely<00:00:53.280> epic<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.730> thought<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.059> one

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
was absolutely epic I thought it was one
of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> best<00:00:54.480> cards<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> game<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.469> thought

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
of the best cards in the game I thought

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.510 
of the best cards in the game I thought

he was great you know but there's no

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.709 
he was great you know but there's no
difference<00:00:59.940> within<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> team<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> season

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

difference within the team of the season
team<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> year<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.530> I've<00:01:01.920> kind<00:01:02.190> of

I<00:01:34.950> thought<00:01:35.430> Messi's<00:01:35.939> team<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> season<00:01:36.659> was

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I thought Messi's team of the season was

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.359 
I thought Messi's team of the season was
better<00:01:36.900> than<00:01:37.079> Ronaldo's<00:01:37.560> team<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> season<00:01:38.220> I

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
better than Ronaldo's team of season I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
better than Ronaldo's team of season I
just<00:01:38.729> felt<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.000> Messi<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.630> obviously

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
just felt like Messi was obviously

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
just felt like Messi was obviously
Messi's<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> center<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> pitch

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
Messi's more in the center of the pitch

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
Messi's more in the center of the pitch
you<00:01:42.000> could<00:01:42.119> plan<00:01:42.270> centre-forward<00:01:42.899> striker<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you could plan centre-forward striker so

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
you could plan centre-forward striker so
that's<00:01:43.590> already<00:01:43.799> advantage<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.880> kind

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that's already advantage and it's kind

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.639 
that's already advantage and it's kind
of<00:01:45.180> sucks<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.509> Ronaldo's<00:01:46.049> left<00:01:46.290> wing<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
of sucks that Ronaldo's left wing and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.899 
of sucks that Ronaldo's left wing and
left<00:01:46.799> me<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.040> he's<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> side<00:01:47.759> you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
left me and he's out on the side you

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
left me and he's out on the side you
don't<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.810> much<00:01:49.229> fun<00:01:49.530> out

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
don't really get as much as much fun out

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
don't really get as much as much fun out
of<00:01:49.740> him<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.340> wasn't<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:51.299> that's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
of him but it wasn't that that's that's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.539 
of him but it wasn't that that's that's
not<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> problem<00:01:52.020> Messi's<00:01:52.799> control<00:01:53.310> was

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
not the problem Messi's control was

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.219 
not the problem Messi's control was
better<00:01:53.790> Messi's<00:01:54.240> dribbling<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:54.960> better

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
better Messi's dribbling was better

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.639 
better Messi's dribbling was better
Messi<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.579> felt<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.180> Messi<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> ball

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
Messi just felt like Messi on the ball

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.230 
Messi just felt like Messi on the ball
it<00:01:58.860> felt<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.250> couldn't<00:01:59.520> people<00:01:59.880> couldn't

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
it felt like I couldn't people couldn't

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149 
it felt like I couldn't people couldn't
get<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> ball<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.680> right<00:02:02.009> now

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
get me off the ball now I know right now

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
get me off the ball now I know right now
there's<00:02:02.490> always<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> great<00:02:03.030> player<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.479> FIFA's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
there's always a great player of FIFA's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.270 
there's always a great player of FIFA's
because<00:02:04.140> he's<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.409> fast<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:05.009> got<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
because he's so fast they got the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.620 
because he's so fast they got the
strength<00:02:05.549> plus<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> got<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.119> five-star

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
strength plus you got the five-star

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.190 
strength plus you got the five-star
skill<00:02:06.930> moves<00:02:07.429> but<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:09.330> enjoyed<00:02:09.720> Messi's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
skill moves but I really enjoyed Messi's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.839 
skill moves but I really enjoyed Messi's
team<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> season<00:02:10.979> better<00:02:11.160> than<00:02:11.340> Ronaldo's

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
team of the season better than Ronaldo's

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.870 
team of the season better than Ronaldo's
now<00:02:12.030> don't<00:02:12.239> get<00:02:12.360> me<00:02:12.510> wrong

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
now don't get me wrong

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.700 
now don't get me wrong
I<00:02:12.940> still<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:13.750> from<00:02:13.870> Ronaldo's<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.530> best

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
I still think from Ronaldo's the best

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.930 
I still think from Ronaldo's the best
player<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.160> game<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:15.580> team<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
player in this game but team of the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.280 
player in this game but team of the
season<00:02:16.240> against<00:02:16.450> team<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.780> season<00:02:17.140> I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
season against team of the season I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.080 
season against team of the season I
think<00:02:17.830> Messi's<00:02:18.220> card<00:02:18.460> was<00:02:18.640> better<00:02:18.910> than

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
think Messi's card was better than

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.880 
think Messi's card was better than
Ronaldo's<00:02:19.630> one<00:02:20.020> thing<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.380> kind<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.710> blows

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
Ronaldo's one thing that kind of blows

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.650 
Ronaldo's one thing that kind of blows
my<00:02:20.950> mind<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.490> Messi's<00:02:21.880> only<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> four<00:02:22.390> star

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
my mind is that Messi's only a four star

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.270 
my mind is that Messi's only a four star
skiller<00:02:22.990> when<00:02:23.410> you're<00:02:23.560> talking<00:02:23.920> Messi<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
skiller when you're talking Messi and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.940 
skiller when you're talking Messi and
Ronaldo<00:02:24.430> they're<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.600> most<00:02:25.840> they're<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
Ronaldo they're the most they're the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.980 
Ronaldo they're the most they're the
best<00:02:27.250> players<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.970> world<00:02:28.150> baby<00:02:28.750> there's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
best players in the world baby there's

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.390 
best players in the world baby there's
nothing<00:02:29.410> better<00:02:29.620> than<00:02:29.740> these<00:02:29.950> two<00:02:30.130> players

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
nothing better than these two players
