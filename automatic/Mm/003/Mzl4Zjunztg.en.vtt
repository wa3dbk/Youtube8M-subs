00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.340 
going okay it's 8 plus 1 phase 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.160> 8<00:02:32.570> plus<00:02:33.570> 1<00:02:33.840> that's<00:02:34.320> 4<00:02:35.180> 4<00:02:36.180> plus<00:02:36.720> 8<00:02:36.990> plus<00:02:37.020> 1

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
6 so 8 plus 1 that's 4 4 plus 8 plus 1

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.950
