00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.720
 0e tv answer you and once again we 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.730
 take a look at the questions you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.679
 we put on the facebook page of 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.480
 01net.com you have been very 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.450
 many to 2.2 die of clarifications 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.450
 about the iphone 6 when you see what 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.640
 and we'll start with a question at 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.560
 background quite good of nicolas 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.900
 who's asking us but what are the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.240
 innovations of these famous iphone 6 and 6 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.590
 more well does not have a thing to do anymore 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.989
 innovation then we joke about it 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.670
 full the first is the size of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.290
 the screen and then follow that there is apple a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.460
 decided to make screens a little bit 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.500
 bigger as sir cadbury is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.070
 so here we are at 4.7 inches for ciss 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.140
 and 5.5 for the ciss more then that makes 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.910
 big 1 this may surprise but the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.649
 fact is that as soon as you taste these great 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 screen sizes we get pretty 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.910
 quickly seduce other novelty the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.250
 design that is different from the previous ones 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.329
 iphone look we are more towards some 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.840
 something that looks like related to the ipod 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.940
 touch 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.620
 here is with a so a smartphone that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 will be thinner than iphone 5 or iphone 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 5 rooms and despite everything a small 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.470
 protuberance behind since the goal 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.960
 of the camera 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.330
 twenty little ones can come out good here after 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.799
 it's a debate on the web after we do not 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.270
 will not fit in all the specs 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.549
 techniques know that wholesale and the most 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 powerful more powerful more better 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.090
 obviously it's normal he has some 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.200
 thing that have never had iphone 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.479
 so far it's a small 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.130
 revolution it's nfc technology that 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.829
 will allow in particular the payment without 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.810
 contact questions on yoann's facebook 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.350
 cool what is the smartphone the most 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.939
 nice 4.7 inches or 5.5 inches and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.259
 yes because if you are an apple fan 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.600
 you will inevitably ask yourself the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.439
 CLTM the matter which one to choose it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.110
 to choose 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.759
 good then but both please 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.710
 I followed the rich want and from 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.869
 look at what is the size that you 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.310
 seems the most fun the big is 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.490
 really big is for a big pocket 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.530
 a big hand too and then there is 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.540
 other small differences in particular 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.670
 at the level of the spectators yes because in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.570
 makes the iphone 6 more to small 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 technical specifications 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.200
 additional as for example the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.520
 optical stabilizer on the device 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.990
 Photo 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 it would look like it makes pictures 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.000
 more friendly obviously we will test 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.349
 its when the nabot will have both 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.360
 copies to note also that 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.170
 the autonomy of the cices more should be 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.840
 a little better 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.310
 apple announces us 12 hours against 10 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.500
 hours for the iphone 6 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.430
 and that's thanks to the large size of 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.220
 the device that allows you to put a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.830
 bigger battery just good 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.459
 and the iphone 6 face the competition face 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.620
 at galaxy s 5 or galaxy note 4 we 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.030
 kevin asks while there is good 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.970
 it's a taste question because knew 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.410
 difficult to slice down then the s5 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.910
 is our case turns under the bone 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.730
 android of course these are the irons of 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.280
 launches from samsung already at the level of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.239
 the camera you have to know that the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.459
 well we do not play in the same yard 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.190
 samsung galaxy s a tale and at 16 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.410
 megapixels while the iphone 6 and 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.910
 iphone 6 plus the ceiling at 8 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.170
 yes but we must still be wary of 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.239
 these mega pixels because we notice 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.780
 after use and especially at the level of 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.870
 01net lab tests that despite his 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.129
 camera with few pixels well 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.139
 the iphone happens often in fact 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.880
 the galaxy's screen one which is better 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.560
 defined it's super amoled it's 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.139
 sublime to he won every 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.540
 suffrages here during lab tests and 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.030
 then about galaxy no 3 and 4 eh 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.940
 well he has a graffiti style is what 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.260
 does not actually have the iphone 6 anymore so 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.970
 it's true to take notes etc 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.150
 to draw it will probably be more 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.530
 easy on the galaxy note 4 good we 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.299
 had lots of questions franÃ§ois 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.250
 desbiens in this case to call a planned 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.900
 this year all of a sudden it's cool 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.359
 questions actually on a point 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.950
 crucial iphone 6 and it's time for 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.599
 can I gurgle with 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.130
 that's the question that makes splash 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.989
 because we do not have the answer finally yes 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.970
 we have the following answer 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.410
 specifications given by apple 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.269
 it is not waterproof so I will 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.599
 advises against dropping it in 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.889
 the sink 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.329
 whereas it is true that today 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.120
 more and more smartphones in particular 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.109
 at samsung are waterproof provided 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.139
 to not forget the little corks when 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.120
 even there are sonny also alex and xperia the 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.980
 question of remy city brook who we 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.769
 ask why apple sells its iphone 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.060
 more and more expensive and until May a 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.260
 layer and who asks if we will have to 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.840
 sell his car to stay iphone and 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.060
 apple or watch it's almost that it's 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.680
 almost that so why is this already 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.690
 that apple raises its rates 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.090
 these rates compared to previous 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.530
 iphone it's not sure but it's true that 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.360
 apple still has this policy of 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.580
 sale of smartphones always very very 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.250
 dear we know that the motto at apple 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.740
 it's at least 30% margin so here it is 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.060
 when we understand that it's a fact 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.510
 expensive is a real position 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.850
 marketing from apple who has 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.139
 decided more and more to introduce themselves 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.389
 as a luxury brand 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.740
 they even debauched recently from 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.870
 great professionals who come from 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.919
 the luxury industry 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.419
 it may not be very bad one if 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.500
 wrong calculation economically when we 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.729
 sees that even in times of crisis 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.229
 the luxury industry is doing very well 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.539
 yes but we must remember that 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.190
 the iphone 6 plus passes in his 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.260
 highest configuration the 1000 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.900
 euros so I said today can 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.100
 put a smartphone can put more than 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.410
 1000 euros in a smartphone then 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.810
 obviously affluent people actually 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.039
 but all those who are used to 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.630
 example of buying a smartphone with a 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.919
 subscription is subsidized this 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.220
 smartphone is still going to hurt 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.020
 as well 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.610
 here it is finished thanks again for 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.750
 all your questions on the facebook of 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.039
 01net.com 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.449
 we always come back very soon 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.130
 very good questions to continue and we 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:29.419
 finds himself for a new number 2 0 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:31.160
 was not going to answer you very quickly a 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.020
 hunk since we will talk about 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.020
 iphone 6 and no
