except<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.449> elixir<00:00:24.449> which<00:00:24.660> doesn't<00:00:25.199> look

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
except for the elixir which doesn't look

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.130 
except for the elixir which doesn't look
really<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.949> difference<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.060> we're<00:00:27.900> also<00:00:28.019> gonna

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
really a difference so we're also gonna

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.200 
really a difference so we're also gonna
be<00:00:28.260> operating<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.650> Giants<00:00:29.250> level<00:00:29.580> 7i<00:00:30.179> believe

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
be operating the Giants level 7i believe

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.840 
be operating the Giants level 7i believe
but<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> Vox<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
but the Vox are in there and we have to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810 
but the Vox are in there and we have to
jump<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.329> regardless<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.370> should<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
jump them regardless so that should be a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.459 
jump them regardless so that should be a
pain<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.200> only<00:00:37.290> have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
pain but you know so we only have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
pain but you know so we only have
fourteen<00:00:37.829> thousand<00:00:38.100> gems<00:00:38.309> which<00:00:39.030> should<00:00:39.239> be

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
fourteen thousand gems which should be

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
fourteen thousand gems which should be
enough<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.200> too<00:00:40.379> sure<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:41.040> enough

stuff like favorite target damage type

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.730 
stuff like favorite target damage type
of<00:01:32.970> course<00:01:33.210> doesn't<00:01:33.810> change<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
of course doesn't change because of

they look the same and the only thing I
see<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.270> difference<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.960> little<00:02:55.230> gold

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
see the difference is that a little gold

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.880

armor<00:02:56.550> around<00:02:56.730> them<00:02:57.090> which<00:02:57.600> looks<00:02:57.990> B's<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.530> had

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
armor around them which looks B's I had

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.920 
armor around them which looks B's I had
got<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> say<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.520> looks<00:02:59.700> great<00:03:00.120> really<00:03:00.540> good

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
got to say it looks great really good

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.930 
got to say it looks great really good
but<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.650> doesn't<00:03:02.100> relieve<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> difference<00:03:02.790> in

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
but it doesn't relieve the difference in

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.730 
but it doesn't relieve the difference in
them<00:03:03.090> really<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.960> look<00:03:04.110> at<00:03:04.230> them<00:03:04.320> from<00:03:04.500> far

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
them really if you look at them from far

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.520 
them really if you look at them from far
away<00:03:04.770> or<00:03:05.040> something<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.550> they<00:03:05.900> look<00:03:06.900> B's<00:03:07.200> right

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
away or something so they look B's right

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.530 
away or something so they look B's right

right here I so there's one right there
it<00:05:58.840> is<00:05:59.260> shooting<00:05:59.710> really<00:06:00.130> fast<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:01.000> only

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
it is shooting really fast the only

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.330 
it is shooting really fast the only
difference<00:06:01.600> is<00:06:01.720> that<00:06:01.780> she<00:06:02.650> doesn't<00:06:02.830> do<00:06:03.040> really

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
difference is that she doesn't do really

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.370 
difference is that she doesn't do really
more<00:06:03.520> damage<00:06:03.940> he's<00:06:04.120> just<00:06:04.360> shooting<00:06:04.780> fast<00:06:05.080> so

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
more damage he's just shooting fast so

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.380 
more damage he's just shooting fast so
it<00:06:05.680> does<00:06:06.070> kill<00:06:06.340> barcha<00:06:06.640> little<00:06:06.940> bits<00:06:07.060> but<00:06:07.210> it

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
it does kill barcha little bits but it

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.930 
it does kill barcha little bits but it
doesn't<00:06:07.690> kill<00:06:07.870> attacks<00:06:08.830> like<00:06:09.040> this<00:06:09.280> it<00:06:09.610> you
