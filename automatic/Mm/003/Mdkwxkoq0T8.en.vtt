00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 bitter part 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.050
 to my mind 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.779
 at the interview 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.100
 very good to everyone I think we're in a 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.040
 new online gta 5 video will be in 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.530
 a mission is worth leaving us 18,000 of 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.360
 19 thousand 20,000 and that some 10 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.120
 thousand from nine minutes two thousand seven 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.250
 a thousand depend how we do it and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.890
 well we do not take out the phone we call 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.780
 pegasus and we request a tank because 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.519
 as well as request a 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.140
 tank maybe many have seen this 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.980
 editor and thief mission in some 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.659
 youtube channels but maybe yes now 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.999
 will work some maybe give you 5000 of 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.379
 rpp 6000 but the safest thing is that 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.360
 is that they give it but good 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.990
 we request the tank so that good 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.810
 I'll explain to you, good people, I'll mention it 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.119
 not forced to do it in tanks and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.520
 are a low level is not required in a 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.649
 tank so if they did not have to 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.840
 get a walk brice that protects you 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.399
 enough of the police that the bullet does not 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.920
 pass and such and many things equal now 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.409
 I was saying 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.479
 let's go to the point value of the mission and what 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.330

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.580

 We are hard men and it's good for you 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.200
 when we get the briefcase what 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.470

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.240
