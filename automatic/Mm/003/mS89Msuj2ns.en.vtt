 third episode of our bride project 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.969
 along this route we already had 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.049
 Engagements on call and for you that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.150
 Of course, you dream about this great day.

 although it is not coming yet 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.779
 It's always good that you understand how 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 this universe works 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.630
 so today we are here again with 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070
 that they give you several tips 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.180
 I hope these tips are very 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.180
 useful in this wonderful phase 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.879
 the tip given by your fiancé about the 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.210
 accessories as you chose to play 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.610
 tihara headdress and the bride then has 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.289
 adviser then usually already 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.730
 bride comes she already comes with an idea 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.570
 formed right 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.960
 but so the tip is to take care 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.390
 headdress earring accessory veil is 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.729
 suddenly is a very large bank for 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.440
 to spot great for an accessory 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.340
 large will still wear a 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.920
 paper 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.590
 so to think that it is a set of 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.610
 tip is a set ne and hair and 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.110
 eyebrow makeup is a beautiful skin 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.770
 is an accessory according to 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.390
 That's when the bride has a doubt, right? 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 I think she has to ask, does she have? 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.740
 to be informed 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.710
 She does not have to be afraid, right, and we will. 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.899
 To here for this to take care of and to give 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.679
 the best care to have these 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.259
 doubts and help even choose and opt 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:44.590
 help the person decide a tip 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.530
 that the new ones always question is just not 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.250
 just a little sun a lot of sun or a lot never 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.329
 too much sun is never what I point out so 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.390
 if the person does not want to make a 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.250
 tanning in the right place , right? 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.070
 sometimes the person is not 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.439
 Sometimes I do not have time so the sun 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.460
 the first hours of the morning 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:10.470
 health home of that tan bronze 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.470
 light looks very pretty 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.250
 The main thing is to combine 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.329
 personality such that when things 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.939
 do not stay at what they say does not look so good 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.060
 in person but when she wears a party 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.620
 literally the all- secure clothing is 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.750
 beautiful and safe 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.989
 I think the most important tip for 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.950
 the first proof is not to forget the shoe 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:45.549
 all falls what do i do get up 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.109
 sit watch I watch it assemble here 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.060
 He and the woman can not give it to her. 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.760
 question the hand itself does not have a place 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.959
 no so I'm quiet but even 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.510
 so sit ups go back not silver 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.510
 with syrup to make an open curve 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.739
 several neighbors tricks because it stops 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.030
 bride a dress that runs from your 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.480
 necessary zone of comfort at the time the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.599
 Boy uses all the time every day to walk. 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.440
 especially this is not the one we are going to 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.569
 car that does not fit even car has to 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.769
 to aim the butt to face all this 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.299
 You have to think, all this has to be 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.970
 done before usually after the first 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:31.590
 Proof may sound silly but to me 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.590
 the most important thing the first test 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:45.820
 the shoe we can all from 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.370
 Swarovski crystals to pearls that are 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.490
 using enough application of the own 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.240
 lace dress good shoe on talking 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.900
 in application this is a case of crystals 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.600
 applied that we do but also 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.110
 pearl can apply other type of 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.560
 crystal varying colors in the next video 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.990

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.270
 daring but we're bringing him 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.750
 to bring a bit of romanticism to 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.450
 the look a little more delicacy and 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.450
 in this video judgment that is a shoe 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.220
 more classic tie it brings a little 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.260
 modernity that the bride does not 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.180
 find anywhere is an ace 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.570
 customized and it fits perfectly 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.090
 foot and this jump is a 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.390
 medium jump great for those who do not give up 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.690
 comfort but even at a good time 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.790

 to do at the party's location or not 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:52.460
 It's going to be a party, we'll just do it. 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.710
 a ceremony goes to mons the bone 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.360

 Do you have this vision you want? 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.210

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.719

 times the bride takes control and goes deeper 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.720

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.930
