air<00:00:47.550> ride<00:00:47.579> which<00:00:48.059> helps<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> thought<00:00:49.920> I'd

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
air ride which helps so I thought I'd

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.889 
air ride which helps so I thought I'd
just<00:00:50.190> do<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> real<00:00:50.579> quick<00:00:50.610> video<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
just do a real quick video and kind of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.180

noise suppression switch and basically
what<00:02:55.069> that<00:02:55.099> does<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:56.959> have<00:02:57.290> fans<00:02:57.739> on

what that does is if you have fans on

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.660 
what that does is if you have fans on
eaters<00:02:58.519> radio<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.569> flip<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.019> switch<00:03:00.049> on

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670

it<00:03:01.670> shuts<00:03:02.120> all<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.540> stuff<00:03:02.840> off<00:03:03.049> which<00:03:03.349> is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
it shuts all of that stuff off which is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.930 
it shuts all of that stuff off which is

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.580 
heaters use also to produce their eat
which<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.489> why<00:03:58.669> the<00:03:59.389> bus<00:03:59.569> generally<00:04:00.290> doesn't

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
which is why the bus generally doesn't

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.589 
which is why the bus generally doesn't
heat<00:04:00.769> up<00:04:00.799> as<00:04:01.609> I'm<00:04:01.760> sorry<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.090> heaters<00:04:02.359> don't

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
heat up as I'm sorry the heaters don't

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.970 
heat up as I'm sorry the heaters don't
generally<00:04:02.900> throw<00:04:03.139> heat<00:04:03.379> until<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.680> bus<00:04:03.829> is

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
generally throw heat until the bus is

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.280 
generally throw heat until the bus is
warmed<00:04:04.310> up<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:05.629> don't<00:04:05.870> really<00:04:05.930> use<00:04:06.260> it

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
warmed up so I don't really use it

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.140 
warmed up so I don't really use it
because<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.739> makes<00:04:06.919> all<00:04:07.010> sorts<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.340> noise<00:04:07.489> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
because it makes all sorts of noise and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.909 
because it makes all sorts of noise and
I'd<00:04:09.049> like<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.319> listen<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.650> it

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
I'd like to listen to it

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.309 
I'd like to listen to it
but<00:04:10.459> I've<00:04:11.299> got<00:04:11.419> lots<00:04:11.599> of<00:04:11.690> heaters<00:04:11.930> in<00:04:12.019> this<00:04:12.139> bus

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
but I've got lots of heaters in this bus

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.439 
but I've got lots of heaters in this bus

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
which is nice too in the rear run in the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.479 
which is nice too in the rear run in the
middle<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:14.810> got<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:14.959> step<00:04:15.199> heater<00:04:15.440> heater<00:04:16.220> for<00:04:16.400> my

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
middle I got a step heater heater for my

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.219 
middle I got a step heater heater for my

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
so I can show you the fans are turned on

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.500 
so I can show you the fans are turned on
