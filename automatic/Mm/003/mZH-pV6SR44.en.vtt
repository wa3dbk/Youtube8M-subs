mod 1 gears so I bought a t-rex 700 main

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.790 
mod 1 gears so I bought a t-rex 700 main
gear<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.450> first<00:01:12.690> thing<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.470> as

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
gear and the first thing I had to do as

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.830 
gear and the first thing I had to do as
you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:17.549> one-way<00:01:17.850> clutch<00:01:18.180> mounts

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you can see the one-way clutch mounts

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.539 
you can see the one-way clutch mounts
it's<00:01:19.409> much<00:01:19.710> larger<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.400> 600<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> had<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it's much larger on the 600 so I had to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.289 
it's much larger on the 600 so I had to
pull<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:26.090> clutch<00:01:27.090> case<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:29.299> machine

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
pull the clutch case out and machine

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.600 
pull the clutch case out and machine
that<00:01:30.510> down<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.110> lathe<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:32.130> where<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that down to my lathe to where now it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
that down to my lathe to where now it
fits<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.049> supposed<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> inside<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
fits like it's supposed to inside of the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
fits like it's supposed to inside of the
main<00:01:35.610> gear<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.180> I'll<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> drill

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
main gear and then I'll have to drill

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.770 
main gear and then I'll have to drill
out<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> holes<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.950> mount<00:01:38.780> I'm

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
out the holes and get that to mount I'm

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
out the holes and get that to mount I'm
going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> use<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.260> same<00:01:42.799> 600<00:01:43.799> tail<00:01:44.610> rotor

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
going to use the same 600 tail rotor

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.910 
going to use the same 600 tail rotor
drive<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> I've<00:01:46.950> picked<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.580> steel<00:01:48.650> mod<00:01:49.650> one

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
right hand corner as my zero zero point

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.120 
right hand corner as my zero zero point
and<00:02:50.360> then<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.450> sent<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> probe<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.680> center

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and then I sent the probe to the center

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.680 
and then I sent the probe to the center
of<00:02:53.489> each<00:02:54.269> bolt<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.640> needed<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.120> drill<00:02:57.480> out

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
of each bolt that I needed to drill out

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.840 
of each bolt that I needed to drill out
for<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.110> mount<00:02:58.319> and<00:03:00.049> begin<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.170> map<00:03:01.350> out<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
for the mount and begin to map out the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.080 
for the mount and begin to map out the
screw<00:03:03.120> locations<00:03:03.769> as<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:05.580> can<00:03:05.700> see<00:03:05.910> we're

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
screw locations as you can see we're

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.559 
screw locations as you can see we're
centered<00:03:06.420> over<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:08.060> second<00:03:09.060> bolt<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
centered over the second bolt to the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.490 
centered over the second bolt to the
left<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.739> master<00:03:11.100> bolt<00:03:12.230> we<00:03:13.230> didn't<00:03:13.380> have

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
left of the master bolt we didn't have

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.250 
left of the master bolt we didn't have
to<00:03:13.620> move<00:03:13.769> any<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.220> why<00:03:15.049> because<00:03:16.049> they're

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
to move any on the why because they're

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.740 
to move any on the why because they're
perpendicular<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.980> each<00:03:17.160> other<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:18.450> we<00:03:18.510> can

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
perpendicular to each other but we can

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.440 
perpendicular to each other but we can
see<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.950> x-axis<00:03:20.400> we<00:03:20.730> move<00:03:21.030> negative

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
see that on the x-axis we move negative

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.190 
see that on the x-axis we move negative
two<00:03:21.660> point<00:03:21.840> five<00:03:22.049> five<00:03:22.290> inches<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.959> made<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
two point five five inches so I made a

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.710 
two point five five inches so I made a
simple<00:03:25.609> simple<00:03:26.609> sketch<00:03:27.260> simple<00:03:28.260> notes<00:03:29.720> do

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
simple simple sketch simple notes do

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.940 
simple simple sketch simple notes do
that<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.140> every<00:03:31.410> hole<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.930> then<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.769> take

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
that for every hole and then I can take

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.979 
that for every hole and then I can take
this<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.700> compare<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> where<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
this in and compare that to where the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.440 
this in and compare that to where the
screw<00:03:37.230> location<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.950> mapped<00:03:38.190> out<00:03:38.430> using<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
screw location is mapped out using the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.620 
screw location is mapped out using the
optical<00:03:39.750> method<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.190> photograph<00:03:41.640> and

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
optical method with the photograph and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.330 
optical method with the photograph and
between<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.200> two<00:03:43.350> methods<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:43.950> should<00:03:44.160> give

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
between the two methods this should give

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.660 
between the two methods this should give
me<00:03:44.420> pretty<00:03:45.420> good<00:03:45.660> accuracy<00:03:46.200> on<00:03:47.010> where<00:03:47.519> the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
me pretty good accuracy on where the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.880 
me pretty good accuracy on where the
holes<00:03:47.910> are<00:03:48.120> going<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.410> align<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.769> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
holes are going to align with the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.490 
holes are going to align with the
brackets<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.489> make<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.660> issue<00:03:51.840> was<00:03:52.380> the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
brackets that I make the issue was the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.240 
brackets that I make the issue was the
holes<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.950> sides<00:03:53.329> is<00:03:54.329> go<00:03:54.600> way<00:03:54.780> down<00:03:55.640> into<00:03:56.640> a

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
holes on the sides is go way down into a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.900 
holes on the sides is go way down into a
casting<00:03:59.630> into<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.930> base<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.319> motor<00:04:01.560> or

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
casting into the base of the motor or

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.509 
casting into the base of the motor or
probably<00:04:02.910> an<00:04:03.480> inch<00:04:04.440> down<00:04:04.980> inside<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.400> those

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
probably an inch down inside of those

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.059 
probably an inch down inside of those
holes<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.959> chose<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.319> probe<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:08.010> was

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
holes so I chose a probe that was

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.039 
holes so I chose a probe that was
approximately<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:09.090> same<00:04:09.299> diameter<00:04:09.630> as<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
approximately the same diameter as the

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.629 
approximately the same diameter as the
hole<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.590> when<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.769> ran<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.160> down<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.489> there

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
hole so when I ran it down in there

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.979 
hole so when I ran it down in there
would<00:04:11.730> be<00:04:11.760> easy<00:04:12.000> for<00:04:12.329> me<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.480> tell<00:04:12.750> if<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.959> was

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
would be easy for me to tell if I was

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.920 
would be easy for me to tell if I was
centered<00:04:13.410> on<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.680> or<00:04:13.799> not

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.180 

so<00:04:19.930> after<00:04:20.199> getting<00:04:20.440> all<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.650> holes<00:04:20.859> mapped

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
so after getting all the holes mapped

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.700 
so after getting all the holes mapped
out<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.699> came<00:04:22.449> in<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:22.900> drew<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.169> up<00:04:23.259> in<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.500> CAD

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
out I came in and drew it up in the CAD

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.149 
out I came in and drew it up in the CAD
software<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:25.470> think<00:04:26.470> I've<00:04:26.590> pretty<00:04:26.830> much<00:04:26.889> got

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
software I think I've pretty much got

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.879 
software I think I've pretty much got
everything<00:04:27.280> done<00:04:28.199> ready<00:04:29.199> to<00:04:29.319> go<00:04:29.470> I'll<00:04:29.620> have<00:04:29.740> to

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
everything done ready to go I'll have to

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.950 
everything done ready to go I'll have to
add<00:04:30.009> a<00:04:30.039> couple<00:04:30.310> holes<00:04:30.550> later<00:04:30.849> for<00:04:31.389> some<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.840> the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
add a couple holes later for some of the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.260 
add a couple holes later for some of the
drivetrain<00:04:32.229> components<00:04:32.830> but<00:04:33.789> I<00:04:33.849> can<00:04:34.030> do<00:04:34.120> that

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
drivetrain components but I can do that

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.809 
drivetrain components but I can do that
manually<00:04:35.099> and<00:04:37.319> I'll<00:04:38.319> get<00:04:38.620> this<00:04:38.860> prototype

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
manually and I'll get this prototype

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.559 
manually and I'll get this prototype
tout<00:04:41.220> here<00:04:42.220> in<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.430> next<00:04:42.580> couple<00:04:42.759> days<00:04:42.940> and

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
tout here in the next couple days and

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.409 
tout here in the next couple days and
see<00:04:44.229> if<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.740> fits<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:48.430> order<00:04:48.880> for<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.180> clutch

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
see if it fits in order for the clutch

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.510 
see if it fits in order for the clutch
bell<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.960> fit<00:04:50.169> underneath<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.680> main<00:04:51.220> rotor

main shaft I need to cut off the
original<00:04:55.380> square<00:04:56.380> drive<00:04:57.539> that<00:04:58.539> was<00:04:58.750> used<00:04:59.430> to

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
original square drive that was used to

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.790 
original square drive that was used to
run<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.729> flexible<00:05:01.150> shaft<00:05:01.409> down<00:05:02.409> to<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.650> weed

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
run the flexible shaft down to the weed

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.969 
run the flexible shaft down to the weed
eater<00:05:02.830> head<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:04.360> won't<00:05:04.659> be<00:05:04.750> necessary<00:05:05.319> since

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
eater head this won't be necessary since

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:15.260 
eater head this won't be necessary since
I'll<00:05:06.130> be<00:05:06.159> adding<00:05:06.639> a<00:05:08.340> posse<00:05:09.479> drive<00:05:10.479> belt<00:05:11.020> system

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.689 

okay<00:05:16.270> I've<00:05:16.360> got<00:05:16.539> that<00:05:16.719> shortened<00:05:17.139> up<00:05:17.490> came<00:05:18.490> out

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
okay I've got that shortened up came out

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.219 
okay I've got that shortened up came out
real<00:05:18.940> nice<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.479> clean<00:05:21.569> so<00:05:22.569> I<00:05:22.630> finished<00:05:22.870> the

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
real nice and clean so I finished the

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.600 
real nice and clean so I finished the
toolpath<00:05:23.590> generation<00:05:24.460> in<00:05:24.759> she<00:05:25.599> cam<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.500> I<00:05:27.430> can

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
toolpath generation in she cam and I can

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.469 
toolpath generation in she cam and I can
convert<00:05:27.819> that<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.539> G<00:05:29.110> code<00:05:29.880> put<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:31.030> on<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.180> USB

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
convert that to G code put it on the USB

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.760 
convert that to G code put it on the USB
stick<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:32.020> then<00:05:32.229> we'll<00:05:32.349> go<00:05:32.500> out<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.680> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
stick and then we'll go out to the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.850 
stick and then we'll go out to the
garage<00:05:32.889> and<00:05:34.289> should<00:05:35.289> be<00:05:35.380> able<00:05:35.469> to<00:05:35.560> cut<00:05:35.740> this

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
garage and should be able to cut this

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.959 
garage and should be able to cut this
out<00:05:36.039> I<00:05:37.740> got<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.830> G<00:05:38.979> code<00:05:39.190> loaded<00:05:39.580> up<00:05:39.699> in<00:05:39.849> the

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
out I got the G code loaded up in the

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:45.260 
out I got the G code loaded up in the
CNC<00:05:40.509> machine<00:05:40.539> and<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:43.240> got<00:05:43.449> the<00:05:43.719> raw<00:05:44.139> stock

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
CNC machine and I got the raw stock

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.499 
CNC machine and I got the raw stock
mounted<00:05:46.270> tool<00:05:46.840> mounted<00:05:48.270> everything<00:05:49.270> should

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
mounted tool mounted everything should

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:40.599 

ok<00:06:38.839> so<00:06:38.989> I<00:06:39.079> got<00:06:39.199> that<00:06:39.349> on<00:06:39.499> machined<00:06:39.859> out<00:06:40.039> cleaned

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:40.609 
ok so I got that on machined out cleaned

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:45.759 
ok so I got that on machined out cleaned
up<00:06:42.009> mounted<00:06:43.009> right<00:06:43.159> on<00:06:43.219> there<00:06:44.469> far<00:06:45.469> as<00:06:45.649> I<00:06:45.709> can

up mounted right on there far as I can

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:50.409 
up mounted right on there far as I can
tell<00:06:46.129> it<00:06:47.089> came<00:06:47.359> out<00:06:47.509> perfectly<00:06:48.969> all<00:06:49.969> the<00:06:50.029> holes

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
tell it came out perfectly all the holes

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.299 
tell it came out perfectly all the holes
line<00:06:50.719> up<00:06:51.009> and<00:06:53.319> get<00:06:54.319> the<00:06:54.469> slots<00:06:54.769> in<00:06:54.979> there<00:06:55.099> that

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:55.309 
line up and get the slots in there that

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:59.199 
line up and get the slots in there that
affords<00:06:55.729> a<00:06:55.789> half-inch<00:06:56.509> of<00:06:57.549> movement<00:06:58.549> so<00:06:58.969> I<00:06:59.029> can

00:06:59.199 --> 00:06:59.209 
affords a half-inch of movement so I can

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:01.839 
affords a half-inch of movement so I can
tighten<00:06:59.629> the<00:06:59.749> drive<00:06:59.989> belt<00:07:00.429> once<00:07:01.429> I<00:07:01.549> get<00:07:01.699> that

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:01.849 
tighten the drive belt once I get that

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.919 
tighten the drive belt once I get that

mechanism uninstalled helicopter body
amount<00:07:06.289> on<00:07:06.409> top<00:07:08.499> and<00:07:09.939> still<00:07:10.939> going<00:07:11.029> to<00:07:11.119> make

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:11.239 
amount on top and still going to make

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:13.329 
amount on top and still going to make
the<00:07:11.359> brackets<00:07:11.539> for<00:07:11.899> that<00:07:12.079> they'll<00:07:13.009> come<00:07:13.309> down

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:13.339 
the brackets for that they'll come down

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:16.509 
the brackets for that they'll come down
mount<00:07:14.269> into<00:07:14.539> these<00:07:14.689> holes<00:07:14.929> I<00:07:15.349> probably<00:07:16.279> can't

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:16.519 
mount into these holes I probably can't

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.239 
mount into these holes I probably can't
see<00:07:16.669> it<00:07:16.789> very<00:07:16.819> well<00:07:17.059> a<00:07:17.799> couple<00:07:18.799> holes<00:07:18.979> there

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:19.249 
see it very well a couple holes there

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:23.889 
see it very well a couple holes there
for<00:07:19.489> mounting<00:07:19.759> the<00:07:19.849> body<00:07:20.059> too<00:07:20.359> and<00:07:22.629> so<00:07:23.629> in<00:07:23.809> the

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:23.899 
for mounting the body too and so in the

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:26.739 
for mounting the body too and so in the
next<00:07:24.049> video<00:07:24.379> I'll<00:07:24.559> be<00:07:24.619> working<00:07:25.009> on<00:07:25.129> the<00:07:25.749> power

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:26.749 
next video I'll be working on the power

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:30.489 
next video I'll be working on the power
transmission<00:07:27.439> system<00:07:27.919> and<00:07:28.989> I'll<00:07:29.989> be<00:07:30.139> the<00:07:30.289> body

00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:30.499 
transmission system and I'll be the body

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:33.639 
transmission system and I'll be the body
mounting<00:07:30.889> brackets<00:07:31.369> and<00:07:32.529> really<00:07:33.529> that's

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:33.649 
mounting brackets and really that's

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:38.019 
mounting brackets and really that's
about<00:07:33.889> all<00:07:34.069> it's<00:07:34.219> left<00:07:36.399> not<00:07:37.399> much<00:07:37.549> further<00:07:37.789> to

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:38.029 
about all it's left not much further to

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:39.999 
about all it's left not much further to
go<00:07:38.139> so<00:07:39.139> this<00:07:39.259> would<00:07:39.379> be<00:07:39.469> the<00:07:39.559> front<00:07:39.859> of<00:07:39.949> the

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:40.009 
go so this would be the front of the

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:43.749 
go so this would be the front of the
helicopter<00:07:41.619> come<00:07:42.619> right<00:07:42.739> up<00:07:42.889> the<00:07:42.979> front<00:07:43.159> these

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 
helicopter come right up the front these

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.699 
helicopter come right up the front these
four<00:07:44.089> holes<00:07:44.419> on<00:07:44.659> these<00:07:44.809> tabs<00:07:45.110> that's<00:07:45.559> where

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:45.709 
four holes on these tabs that's where

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:47.319 
four holes on these tabs that's where
the<00:07:45.799> skids<00:07:46.129> will<00:07:46.309> amount<00:07:46.429> to<00:07:46.579> the<00:07:46.849> skids<00:07:47.149> will

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:47.329 
the skids will amount to the skids will

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:52.269 
the skids will amount to the skids will
mount<00:07:49.599> one<00:07:50.599> of<00:07:50.719> the<00:07:50.809> corners<00:07:51.229> come<00:07:51.589> out<00:07:51.739> come

00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:52.279 
mount one of the corners come out come

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:55.059 
mount one of the corners come out come
down<00:07:52.599> and<00:07:53.599> the<00:07:53.929> remoter<00:07:54.559> will<00:07:54.799> just<00:07:54.979> be

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:55.069 
down and the remoter will just be

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:59.679 
down and the remoter will just be
cradled<00:07:56.499> amongst<00:07:57.499> all<00:07:57.649> that
