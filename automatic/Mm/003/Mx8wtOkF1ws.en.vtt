00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.270
 new episode of gastro.de today we go 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.150
 back to the Asian I want you there 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.620
 like a spicy asian honey and 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.920
 show that we need it 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.230
 in the lower leg about two 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 kilo four people should achieve that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.610
 how nice clean cleaning would have been 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:04.410
 certainly then we need ingredients 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:07.140
 honey honey some peanut oil two 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.450
 tablespoon especially about 150 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.119
 Milliliter of bright soy sauce two 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.369
 tablespoon butter sugar and again that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.600
 beautiful famous sambal olek one to two 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.920
 teaspoon after that we have sharper 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.070
 Add everything to a bowl 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 It is best to first use the liquid ingredients 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:35.280
 So first soy sauce if the oil then 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.080
 now feel in sugar and never 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.740
 seen for so long until the sugar 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.740
 disbanded 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.240
 so nice to stir until he realizes that 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.000
 even left no extreme 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.570
 and that he got used to it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.299
 i need the topic in the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:04.970
 fast-forward then we add roughly 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:09.170
 1 2 tablespoons to make anyway 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.540
 every tartner has two teaspoons of his 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.850
 balcony we are all together 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.970
 then we feel the mixed 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.319
 behind ham added and try 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.600
 then from every side with this 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.730
 to marinade and then become 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.110
 indirectly grilled indirectly at one 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.760
 temperature 150-160 degrees wide 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.410
 one and a half to two hours depending on 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.840
 is the desired color is achieved 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.160
 but that brings you something right away 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.599
 forgot to mention now 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.620
 it would like to be two 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.700
 I'll do that in the garlic cloves 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.620
 not everyone is on garlic I 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.989
 even that rainer the taste 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.359
 I'll press that bit fresh 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.100
 clean and then redistribute it in 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.180
 the marinade before the chicken 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.180
 lower leg then in there 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.430
 and then distribute it again nicely 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.770
 someday maybe you are lower leg 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.530
 purely 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.120
 I have prepared the marinade 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.920
 I already showed you today 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.890
 let in the many lower legs and leave 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.260
 is marinating for half an hour 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.880
 The grill is just pre-heated grill 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.070
 indirectly as I said earlier I had yes 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.600
 already mentioned for it at 150 160 degrees 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.209
 indirect and we leave the marinade 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.300
 11 I still have no idea who wants to 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.010
 Can with a marinade tip the 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.459
 marinade thieves have prepared 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.260
 in the rich with it but inject 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.870
 Tasty is not 7 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.940
 that is the superficial touch 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.650
 meat is enough for some already 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.410
 and the more intense may like this 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.750
 Marinade tips I put the jews here 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.850
 pure and mix them then everyone is called 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.900
 with the hand that the marinade 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.959
 get anywhere and leave that about 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.610
 draw a half hour long, they turn 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.570
 then again and again they will be over 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.290
 has said as half an hour 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:15.030
 move and then indirectly grilled or 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.859
 the marinade has moved in I have 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.120
 now no with the marinade tip 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.049
 treated but now I want to just 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.169
 in the right corner to give green has 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.740
 now the temperature is reached and we 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.330
 Now put on the thighs as such 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.120
 the indirect side that is in the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.700
 fall in the middle distribute the thighs 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.289
 just always belong a bit 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.219
 could do the grill 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.219
 the temperature is reached 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.160
 and then distribute it and as I said 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.600
 they are staying there for about now 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.830
 but one and a half to two hours run 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.270
 the final result, I 'll show you then 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.620
 to treat in between 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.760
 he does not just mean it indirectly 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.300
 glaring one and a half to two hours 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.060
 wait and you have a pleasure okay the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.180
 chicken thighs are finished now 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.620
 for my concepts ready for the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.030
 you do not have any preparation yourself now 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.110
 really much is done on the marinade 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.670
 made the chicken thighs 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.440
 let it go a bit 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.950
 the indirect heat at one and a half to 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.030
 two hours 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.880
 they have two hours here now 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.410
 used and the taste experience 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.630
 just great I look at you as they look 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.730
 should and color 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.150
 pictures really speak for it 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.240
 yourself 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.550
 to be honest and yes by the 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.470
 slight sharpness and through the honey 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.900
 it tastes really excellent 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.980
 The duty is now someone glass bowl 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.140
 and then you're really ready to go 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.340
 eat and have really 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.520
 all around a complete 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:50.720
 have achieved a complete round 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.419
 wanted if it looks like that and we
