00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.100
 Put the eyeliner 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:57.240
 At first, I put in a liquid eyeliner, but once I explode 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:01.760

 After all this is a type that is hard to fall off, so make foundation so much 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.060
 There is not, but after all the lip is fixed a lot, so fit that is hard to fall off like this 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.900
