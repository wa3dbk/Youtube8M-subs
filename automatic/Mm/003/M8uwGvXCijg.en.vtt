I<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.459> want<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.850> note<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.150> one<00:03:03.390> area<00:03:03.600> here<00:03:03.959> in

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
I do want to note this one area here in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.050 
I do want to note this one area here in
purple<00:03:04.319> that's<00:03:04.890> mainly<00:03:05.130> due<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.700> banding

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
purple that's mainly due to that banding

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.789 
purple that's mainly due to that banding
that<00:03:06.180> came<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.569> shore<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.290> hit<00:03:07.590> these

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
that came on shore and it hit these

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.020 
that came on shore and it hit these
mountains<00:03:08.190> right<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:08.940> was

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
mountains right in here and as I was

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.910 
mountains right in here and as I was
known<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.269> before<00:03:09.690> landfall<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.290> lot<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.799> that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
known in before landfall a lot of that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.309 
known in before landfall a lot of that
rainfall<00:03:11.100> got<00:03:11.580> squeezed<00:03:12.540> out<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> sponge

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
rainfall got squeezed out like a sponge

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.780 
rainfall got squeezed out like a sponge
along<00:03:13.709> these<00:03:13.860> mountains<00:03:14.250> here<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.610> that's

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
along these mountains here and that's

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.430 
along these mountains here and that's
why<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> see<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.510> heavier<00:03:15.780> right<00:03:16.049> there<00:03:16.260> and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
why you see that heavier right there and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.080 
why you see that heavier right there and
it<00:03:16.500> actually<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.040> little<00:03:17.400> bit<00:03:17.519> less<00:03:17.760> right

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
it actually it's a little bit less right

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
it actually it's a little bit less right
here<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.079> east<00:03:19.410> side<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.709> these<00:03:19.920> mountains

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
here on the east side of these mountains

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.310 
here on the east side of these mountains
so<00:03:20.459> good<00:03:21.000> news<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.540> live<00:03:21.720> over<00:03:21.959> here<00:03:21.989> you

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
so good news if you live over here you

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.050 
so good news if you live over here you
didn't<00:03:22.560> see<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:22.799> much<00:03:22.829> but<00:03:23.220> basically<00:03:23.820> these

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
didn't see as much but basically these

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.910 
didn't see as much but basically these
areas<00:03:24.540> along<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.870> eastern<00:03:25.320> coast<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.799> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
areas along the eastern coast of the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.430 
areas along the eastern coast of the
Sierra<00:03:26.250> Madres<00:03:26.760> that's<00:03:27.269> where<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.660> see<00:03:27.930> those

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
Sierra Madres that's where you see those

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.710 
Sierra Madres that's where you see those
higher<00:03:28.890> totals<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:30.120> also<00:03:30.359> going<00:03:30.660> to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
higher totals and this is also going to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.259 
higher totals and this is also going to
play<00:03:30.959> until<00:03:31.350> with<00:03:31.859> typhoon<00:03:32.459> Augie<00:03:32.790> as<00:03:33.060> it

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
play until with typhoon Augie as it

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.910 
play until with typhoon Augie as it
moves<00:03:33.540> off<00:03:33.720> towards<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.200> west<00:03:34.350> here<00:03:34.590> towards

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
moves off towards the west here towards

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.949 
moves off towards the west here towards
those<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.280> now<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.670> system<00:03:36.090> not<00:03:36.269> as<00:03:36.450> wide<00:03:36.720> as

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
those on now this system not as wide as

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.110 
those on now this system not as wide as
NASA<00:03:37.200> was<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.070> packing<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.609> winds<00:03:38.820> 80

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
NASA was but it is packing the winds 80

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.710 
NASA was but it is packing the winds 80
gusting<00:03:39.690> up<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.890> 115<00:03:40.890> knots<00:03:41.160> right<00:03:41.459> now<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.880> 955

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
gusting up to 115 knots right now in 955

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.979 
gusting up to 115 knots right now in 955
HPA<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.859> very<00:03:44.370> deep<00:03:44.820> slow<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.750> still

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
HPA so a very deep slow and it is still

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.259 
HPA so a very deep slow and it is still
expected<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.590> intensify<00:03:46.829> reaching<00:03:47.790> upwards

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
expected to intensify reaching upwards

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.090 
expected to intensify reaching upwards
of<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.570> 100<00:03:49.140> or<00:03:49.230> maybe<00:03:49.410> higher<00:03:49.709> than<00:03:49.950> that

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
of a 100 or maybe higher than that

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.460 
of a 100 or maybe higher than that
sustained<00:03:50.730> winds<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.320> be<00:03:52.380> a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
sustained winds so it is going to be a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.160 
sustained winds so it is going to be a
very<00:03:52.829> strong<00:03:53.250> system<00:03:53.700> at<00:03:53.820> landfall<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.720> is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
very strong system at landfall it is

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.780 
very strong system at landfall it is
tracking<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.769> little<00:03:56.010> bit<00:03:56.100> farther<00:03:56.370> towards

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
tracking a little bit farther towards

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.880 
tracking a little bit farther towards
yourself<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.540> originally<00:03:58.079> was<00:03:58.109> anticipated

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
yourself that originally was anticipated

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.650 
yourself that originally was anticipated
out<00:03:59.010> here<00:03:59.250> on<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.519> forecast<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.209> was<00:04:00.329> noting

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
out here on the forecast I was noting

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.180 
out here on the forecast I was noting
here<00:04:00.840> actually<00:04:01.049> about<00:04:01.319> 23<00:04:01.799> days<00:04:01.829> ago<00:04:02.160> about

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
here actually about 23 days ago about

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.920 
here actually about 23 days ago about
the<00:04:02.489> possibility<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.329> surge<00:04:03.660> coming

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
the possibility of that surge coming

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.300 
the possibility of that surge coming
down<00:04:04.200> without<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.560> little<00:04:04.769> bit<00:04:04.920> more<00:04:05.069> than<00:04:05.280> a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
down without a little bit more than a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.729 
down without a little bit more than a
second<00:04:05.760> but<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.420> storm<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.840> seeing<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.500> lot<00:04:07.709> of

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
second but this storm is seeing a lot of

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.590 
second but this storm is seeing a lot of
good<00:04:07.890> circulation<00:04:08.400> right<00:04:09.030> now<00:04:09.180> actually<00:04:09.329> we

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
good circulation right now actually we

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.420 
good circulation right now actually we
look<00:04:09.750> at<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.900> IR<00:04:10.230> water<00:04:10.530> vapor<00:04:10.739> differential

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
look at the IR water vapor differential

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.650 
look at the IR water vapor differential
you've<00:04:11.519> seen<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> lot<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:11.940> moisture<00:04:12.180> being

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
you've seen a lot of moisture being

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.390 
you've seen a lot of moisture being
pumped<00:04:13.079> in<00:04:13.170> from<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.500> south<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.250> that's

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
pumped in from the south so that's

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.069 
pumped in from the south so that's
allowing<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.880> lot<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.209> moisture<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.810> build

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
allowing a lot of that moisture to build

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.920 
allowing a lot of that moisture to build
up<00:04:16.320> on<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> system<00:04:16.950> not<00:04:17.160> only<00:04:17.190> but<00:04:17.789> also<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:18.450> lot

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
up on the system not only but also a lot

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.479 
up on the system not only but also a lot
wish<00:04:19.200> they'll<00:04:19.410> seem<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.739> high<00:04:19.919> pressure<00:04:20.220> so

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
wish they'll seem that high pressure so

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.159 
wish they'll seem that high pressure so
that's<00:04:20.639> allowing<00:04:21.030> for<00:04:21.180> good<00:04:21.329> divergence<00:04:21.900> loft

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
that's allowing for good divergence loft

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.649 
that's allowing for good divergence loft
as<00:04:22.380> well<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.250> system<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.849> expected<00:04:24.479> to

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
as well so the system is expected to

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.050 
as well so the system is expected to
maintain<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.289> increase<00:04:25.890> in<00:04:26.370> intensity<00:04:26.760> as<00:04:26.940> it

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
maintain and increase in intensity as it

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.650 
maintain and increase in intensity as it
continues

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
continues

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.630 
continues
back<00:04:27.750> off<00:04:27.930> towards<00:04:28.260> West<00:04:28.560> here<00:04:28.860> along<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
back off towards West here along the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.220 
back off towards West here along the
southern<00:04:29.970> periphery<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.420> this<00:04:30.690> high<00:04:30.870> pressure

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
southern periphery of this high pressure

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
up towards north and that can be seen

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.640 
up towards north and that can be seen
here<00:04:33.180> on<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> streamline<00:04:33.810> analysis<00:04:34.290> noting

here on the streamline analysis noting
all<00:04:34.800> these<00:04:34.980> areas<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.520> blue<00:04:35.670> indicating<00:04:36.180> that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
all these areas in blue indicating that

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.150 
all these areas in blue indicating that
negative<00:04:36.750> vorticity<00:04:37.110> associated<00:04:37.950> with<00:04:38.070> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
high and it's not going to want to run

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.600 
high and it's not going to want to run
towards<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.350> location<00:04:40.860> as<00:04:41.010> I've<00:04:41.220> noted<00:04:41.430> in

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
towards that location as I've noted in

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.640 
towards that location as I've noted in
the<00:04:41.670> past<00:04:41.910> typhoons<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.780> tropical<00:04:43.290> systems

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
the past typhoons and tropical systems

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.340 
the past typhoons and tropical systems
are<00:04:43.800> like<00:04:43.950> want<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.670> run<00:04:44.880> downhill<00:04:45.270> towards<00:04:46.170> a

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
are like want to run downhill towards a

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.050 
are like want to run downhill towards a
lower<00:04:46.590> pressure<00:04:46.890> kind<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.340> like<00:04:47.430> water<00:04:47.730> just

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
lower pressure kind of like water just

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.970 
lower pressure kind of like water just
basically<00:04:48.420> falling<00:04:48.840> they<00:04:49.380> always<00:04:49.620> want<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.830> go

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
basically falling they always want to go

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.920 
basically falling they always want to go
down<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.460> if<00:04:50.670> that<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> case<00:04:51.360> it's<00:04:51.780> going

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
down so if that is the case it's going

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.720 
down so if that is the case it's going
to<00:04:52.020> continue<00:04:52.290> to<00:04:52.440> track<00:04:52.740> off<00:04:53.010> basically<00:04:53.580> in

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
to continue to track off basically in

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.120 
to continue to track off basically in
this<00:04:53.850> direction<00:04:54.140> towards<00:04:55.140> Central<00:04:55.650> Luzon

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
this direction towards Central Luzon

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.440 
this direction towards Central Luzon
right<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.550> here<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:56.820> can<00:04:56.940> kind<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.180> see<00:04:57.330> that

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
right in here you can kind of see that

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.780 
right in here you can kind of see that
dip<00:04:57.780> rate<00:04:58.050> in<00:04:58.290> this<00:04:58.530> region<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.190> that's<00:04:59.580> where

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
dip rate in this region and that's where

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.040 
dip rate in this region and that's where
it's<00:04:59.940> going<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.120> want<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.390> follow<00:05:00.660> is<00:05:00.900> that

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
it's going to want to follow is that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.840 
it's going to want to follow is that
overall<00:05:01.350> background<00:05:01.920> flow<00:05:02.130> definitely<00:05:02.670> not

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
overall background flow definitely not

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.220 
overall background flow definitely not
going<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.060> see<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:03.240> recurve<00:05:03.690> ature<00:05:03.930> towards

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
going to see that recurve ature towards

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.260 
going to see that recurve ature towards
north<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:04.710> looks<00:05:05.190> like<00:05:05.280> taiwan<00:05:05.760> is<00:05:05.940> starting

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
north so looks like taiwan is starting

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.090 
north so looks like taiwan is starting
to<00:05:06.360> get<00:05:06.450> more<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> clear<00:05:07.290> here<00:05:07.500> as<00:05:07.650> this

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
to get more in the clear here as this

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.980 
to get more in the clear here as this
system<00:05:08.490> likely<00:05:08.880> will<00:05:09.060> follow<00:05:09.360> out<00:05:09.630> towards

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
system likely will follow out towards

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.750 
system likely will follow out towards
the<00:05:10.050> west<00:05:10.230> and<00:05:10.440> then<00:05:10.590> recurve<00:05:11.100> off<00:05:11.370> towards

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
the west and then recurve off towards

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.060 
the west and then recurve off towards
the<00:05:11.910> west<00:05:12.390> northwest<00:05:12.870> basically<00:05:13.800> in<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.040> same

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
the west northwest basically in the same

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.880 
the west northwest basically in the same
location<00:05:14.370> as<00:05:15.060> ness<00:05:15.390> ave<00:05:15.660> made<00:05:15.930> around<00:05:16.650> her

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
location as ness ave made around her

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.980 
location as ness ave made around her
nine<00:05:17.130> here<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.820> very<00:05:18.330> dangerous<00:05:18.570> situation

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
nine here so a very dangerous situation

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.080 
nine here so a very dangerous situation
as<00:05:19.590> much<00:05:19.890> of<00:05:20.040> these<00:05:20.130> areas<00:05:20.370> have<00:05:20.640> already<00:05:20.730> seen

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
as much of these areas have already seen

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.520 
as much of these areas have already seen
these<00:05:21.240> high<00:05:21.420> winds<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:21.810> rain<00:05:22.020> fall<00:05:22.260> in<00:05:22.440> the

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
these high winds and rain fall in the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.530 
these high winds and rain fall in the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
past week and if this storm does remain

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.570 
past week and if this storm does remain
on<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:24.840> similar<00:05:25.260> track<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.770> definitely<00:05:26.400> will

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
on that similar track it definitely will

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.580 
on that similar track it definitely will
compound<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.300> exasperate<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.020> problem<00:05:28.440> out

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
compound and exasperate the problem out

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.500 
compound and exasperate the problem out
there<00:05:28.620> but<00:05:29.010> showing<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.370> here<00:05:29.700> gfs<00:05:30.330> is

weekend here actually on Saturday
evening<00:05:36.780> into<00:05:37.170> Sunday<00:05:37.440> you're<00:05:37.770> going<00:05:37.920> to<00:05:37.980> see

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
evening into Sunday you're going to see

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.280 
evening into Sunday you're going to see
that<00:05:38.310> landfall<00:05:38.760> bring<00:05:39.390> all<00:05:39.540> that<00:05:39.720> rainfall

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
that landfall bring all that rainfall

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.590 
that landfall bring all that rainfall
and<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:41.100> mainly<00:05:41.520> due<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.000> that<00:05:42.390> more

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
and that is mainly due to that more

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.330 
and that is mainly due to that more
subtle<00:05:42.930> each<00:05:43.020> course<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:43.590> because<00:05:43.980> of<00:05:44.010> this

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
subtle each course is because of this

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.430 
subtle each course is because of this
billing<00:05:44.910> of<00:05:45.090> air<00:05:45.360> from<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.630> north<00:05:45.750> here<00:05:46.290> you

billing of air from the north here you

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.260 
billing of air from the north here you
see<00:05:46.620> this<00:05:46.770> Ridge<00:05:47.070> here<00:05:47.100> well<00:05:47.880> this<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.030> all

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
see this Ridge here well this is all

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.360 
see this Ridge here well this is all
associated<00:05:48.750> with<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:48.990> asiatic<00:05:49.500> hi<00:05:49.650> following

in behind that trough of low pressure
over<00:05:51.900> japan<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:52.590> i'll<00:05:52.740> also<00:05:52.950> be<00:05:53.250> bringing<00:05:53.370> a

over japan that i'll also be bringing a

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.000 
over japan that i'll also be bringing a
precipitation<00:05:54.150> out<00:05:54.419> there<00:05:54.660> but<00:05:55.380> with<00:05:55.560> all<00:05:55.830> of

precipitation out there but with all of

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.380 
precipitation out there but with all of
that<00:05:56.040> it's<00:05:56.310> going<00:05:56.430> to<00:05:56.490> push<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:56.910> system<00:05:57.270> a

that it's going to push the system a

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.120 
that it's going to push the system a
little<00:05:57.600> bit<00:05:57.720> farther<00:05:57.960> towards<00:05:58.350> itself<00:05:58.740> and

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
little bit farther towards itself and

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.310 
little bit farther towards itself and
also<00:06:00.060> with<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.450> alike<00:06:00.690> as<00:06:00.900> this<00:06:01.080> continues

this area out here in Indochina would

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.290 
this area out here in Indochina would

definitely have to brace for yet another
storm<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.140> no<00:06:22.230> they're<00:06:22.410> still<00:06:22.590> dealing<00:06:22.980> with

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010

storm and no they're still dealing with
nessa<00:06:23.820> out<00:06:24.150> there<00:06:24.360> but<00:06:24.540> this<00:06:24.690> one<00:06:24.900> looks<00:06:24.930> like

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
nessa out there but this one looks like

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.800 
nessa out there but this one looks like
it<00:06:25.440> will<00:06:25.590> maintain<00:06:25.880> intensity<00:06:26.880> as<00:06:27.030> it<00:06:27.570> tracks

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
it will maintain intensity as it tracks

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.480 
it will maintain intensity as it tracks
off<00:06:28.020> towards<00:06:28.320> that<00:06:28.440> direction<00:06:28.560> so<00:06:29.040> could<00:06:29.340> be<00:06:29.460> a

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
off towards that direction so could be a

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.010

why Winfield here with this storm in

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.660 
why Winfield here with this storm in
Manila<00:07:12.750> so<00:07:13.170> good<00:07:13.770> news<00:07:13.950> I<00:07:14.160> don't<00:07:14.340> think<00:07:14.550> that

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
Manila so good news I don't think that

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.950 
Manila so good news I don't think that
there's<00:07:14.820> going<00:07:15.030> to<00:07:15.090> be<00:07:15.150> a<00:07:15.240> search<00:07:15.600> there<00:07:15.870> in

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
there's going to be a search there in

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.870 
there's going to be a search there in
Manila<00:07:16.290> but<00:07:16.650> there<00:07:17.220> is<00:07:17.250> going<00:07:17.490> to<00:07:17.580> be<00:07:17.640> some

Manila but there is going to be some
high<00:07:18.030> wave<00:07:18.300> so<00:07:18.510> definitely<00:07:18.870> not<00:07:19.020> one<00:07:19.200> of<00:07:19.230> those

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
high wave so definitely not one of those

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.110 
high wave so definitely not one of those

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
that come over the walls there so can

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.720 
that come over the walls there so can
continue<00:07:25.500> to<00:07:25.620> watch<00:07:25.830> a<00:07:25.950> storm<00:07:26.220> as<00:07:26.370> well<00:07:26.550> though

towards her nine yet again on a similar

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.060 
towards her nine yet again on a similar
track<00:07:34.860> as<00:07:35.040> neset<00:07:35.490> so<00:07:35.760> really<00:07:36.600> kind<00:07:36.870> of<00:07:36.990> deja<00:07:37.830> vu

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070 
track as neset so really kind of deja vu

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.650 
track as neset so really kind of deja vu
with<00:07:38.250> this<00:07:38.400> system<00:07:38.610> but<00:07:39.180> different<00:07:39.510> in<00:07:39.540> the

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 
with this system but different in the

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.330 
with this system but different in the
fact<00:07:39.840> that<00:07:40.020> the<00:07:40.230> ground<00:07:40.500> out<00:07:40.710> here<00:07:40.980> across<00:07:41.220> the

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 
fact that the ground out here across the

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.730 
fact that the ground out here across the
Philippines<00:07:41.940> is<00:07:42.090> already<00:07:42.600> saturated<00:07:43.080> and

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 
Philippines is already saturated and

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.380 
Philippines is already saturated and
definitely<00:07:44.220> can<00:07:44.430> sport<00:07:44.730> any<00:07:44.910> more<00:07:45.150> rainfall

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.390 
definitely can sport any more rainfall

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.620 
definitely can sport any more rainfall
and<00:07:46.110> at<00:07:46.410> the<00:07:46.590> magnitude<00:07:47.130> of<00:07:47.340> about<00:07:47.580> 200<00:07:48.060> to<00:07:48.090> 300

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:48.630 
and at the magnitude of about 200 to 300

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.600 
and at the magnitude of about 200 to 300
millimetres<00:07:49.140> of<00:07:49.170> rainfall<00:07:49.470> total<00:07:50.220> as<00:07:50.370> the

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610 
millimetres of rainfall total as the

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.520 
millimetres of rainfall total as the
system<00:07:51.000> tracks<00:07:51.300> across<00:07:51.630> and<00:07:51.960> possibly<00:07:52.440> even

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:52.530 
system tracks across and possibly even

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.500 
system tracks across and possibly even
higher<00:07:53.010> than<00:07:53.040> that<00:07:53.310> in<00:07:53.520> many<00:07:53.670> locations<00:07:54.090> so

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.510 
higher than that in many locations so

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.000 
higher than that in many locations so
this<00:07:54.990> is<00:07:55.140> going<00:07:55.320> to<00:07:55.410> be<00:07:55.530> a<00:07:55.560> very<00:07:55.650> dangerous

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.010 
this is going to be a very dangerous

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.560 
this is going to be a very dangerous
situation<00:07:56.400> as<00:07:56.880> it<00:07:56.910> goes<00:07:57.150> off<00:07:57.330> in<00:07:57.480> that

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:57.570 
situation as it goes off in that

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.930 
situation as it goes off in that
direction<00:07:57.630> but<00:07:58.530> we<00:07:59.190> will<00:07:59.340> continue<00:07:59.700> to<00:07:59.790> keep

00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940 
direction but we will continue to keep

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.250 
direction but we will continue to keep
