00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 recipes on the fly just take a ride in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.549
 garden to take inspiration 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.379
 right this year as well as the year 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.780
 last by a thousand fine plant stands 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.000
 giving away a lot of meaty foreheads and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.040
 after the tart I eat fig jam 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 and I decided to do the fine pic of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.460
 ricotta a fast recipe e 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.699
 as simple as we never see it 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 treats to prepare stuffed figs 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.240
 we need ten children around 500 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.539
 grams 100 g of fresh ricotta a 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.130
 pinch of cinnamon 10 almonds about 12 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.079
 15 grams 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.450
 the recipe is very very simple and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.950
 fast then we wash first 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.430
 all the peaks we dry 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.280
 gently now we remove the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.690
 we stand at 12 cm from the petiole 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.539
 so and then we renew the whole pulp 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.090
 we can proceed in two ways or with the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.550
 knife point we carve the pulp 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.649
 so without breaking the edges and then with a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.299
 teaspoon remove the pulp 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.680
 so then we also dig inside 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 we remove the pulp and maybe put it on 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.560
 in a boule we put it aside 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 which we will then need 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.190
 or we can use the digger 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.479
 so what do we do 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.270
 we always cut the cap of the fig tree and 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.670
 with dig it this the same with 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.430
 where the melon balls are prepared e 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.440
 not to mention we dig it with 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.720
 this is even simpler 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:46.130
 here it is we remove all the pulp and 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:49.100
 we put them in the bull we now add 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.170
 fresh ricotta is not necessary to add 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.330
 sugar because clearly the children 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.009
 they are already very very sweet for moro 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.740
 ok amalgami loves and we also add a 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.750
 pinch of cinnamon 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:09.590
 according to me the contrast is fab it is especially 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.819
 I recommend right now to do the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.560
 things done well 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.120
 I would put the filling inside 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.970
 a porsche disposable bag then 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.150
 put the pastry bag inside a 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.350
 cylinder to help us but we are therefore the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.350
 filling inside 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.280
 now we cut the needle to the sacred 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.590
 porsche we do or better and fill 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.480
 all the half shells of fig then 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.130
 put the almond inside and then 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.130
 we close with the other filling 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.950
 ricotta's children are perfect from 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.870
 serve as a quick dessert 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.790
 if you want to replace ricotta instead 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.500
 with cream cheese type is 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.020
 Of course you can instead serve them as 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.020
 alternative appetizer and tasty self
