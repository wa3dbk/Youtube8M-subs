00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 almost vino eskara is about 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.930
 a drama robes animated at home 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.370
 dreamworks consisting of 26 full 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.900
 also was rather rare 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.400
 must prevail today 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.929
 maybe if one or the other something 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.700
 full of dangers but come now only 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 time to plot this turns at first 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 mainly consist of the clique 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 like karim at acazis ag and canada all 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.470
 are just normal teenagers 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.939
 at least almost because they live in one 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.289
 underwater village in the sea 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.910
 but they are basically like that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.560
 people in the surface have but 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.449
 a so-called in which the under 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.369
 Water life allows both countries 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.170
 but in a certain degree limits one 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.160
 day happens school because of lack 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.930
 closed to students 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.670
 thus the adolescents have to demand 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.200
 the surface and her school days there 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.910
 It quickly becomes clear that the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.129
 advantages of the villagers 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.510
 baseless and soon attract almost everyone 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.950
 I want to stand in this spot 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.300
 Do not betray too much now 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 All the plot is real here 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.840
 succeeded and decisive for the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.430
 further course of the series is the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.360
 characters are all in my eyes 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.579
 quite well done 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 guitarist the bright self-assured 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 group leader of the now and then though but 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 can be quite harsh but still one 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.229
 big heart possesses ak is the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 the characters were more likely to protect theirs 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.549
 shy but always 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 In spite of all that, sincere style shows 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.729
 to enchant 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.740
 Jackie and Panama are both he something 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.479
 dishonest to yourself and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 probably just come in therefore synonymous 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.900
 one or the other predicament to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.280
 eco is the first country dwellers which 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.500
 really with the sea dwellers 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.150
 admits what it shows quickly that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.070
 he's a banker type since here yet 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.009
 plenty of characters to call such 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.750
 eg academics, the sister pink the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.670
 creator of the sea god too 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.070
 many more I just want one more 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.720
 at this point, namely mio 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.250
 that makes the biggest in my eyes 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 Character development was through me 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.729
 At first I also have to dislike 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.290
 However, it has gradually been admitted 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.149
 to my favorite character of the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.680
 entire series and also here 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.840
 I do not tell you anymore 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.700
 optically, the anime has a lot to offer 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.649
 the works boundaries here again with 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.210
 grandiose animations in spectators 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.920
 a beautiful animated scenery 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.259
 deliver especially the underwater worlds 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.909
 are really extremely nice to look at 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.950
 Musically, this is my eyes 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.290
 in every second really top backed 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.119
 the mixed sounds sometimes sad 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.420
 let's stop it fits like a fist 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.369
 eye 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 be it the opening melody, the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.239
 baltic sea in itself or even that ever 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.230
 All said to build their special 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.790
 atmosphere on 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.739
 keyword atmosphere this can 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.959
 also from happy to extreme 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.120
 gloomy wavering optimally in this 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.650
 Drama of the extra class works too 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 turning to rather difficult ones 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.480
 situations and topics such as the social 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.069
 exclusion up to this racism are 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 really very interesting really 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.370
 I did not ask negative criticism 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.900
 because she may have a two 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.340
 something attracted and it was now 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.440
 really complain at the highest level 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.819
 conclusion the fascinating history and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.890
 the underwater inhabitants their 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.450
 complicated and entangled relationships 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.310
 to each other as well as generally the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.530
 create an incredibly good atmosphere 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.150
 a drama or 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.280
 that I can really see 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.920
 unlike, for example , you were wearing 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.750
 uses the animationsstudio px here 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.609
 no pictures and tell more 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.530
 no, they deliver really great here 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.940
 musical animations is the whole thing 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.310
 also not to complain about 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.959
 music is meant to be there and actually 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.180
 Comparison is my opinion mostly 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.489
 not directly with other comments 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
 my critic i just have two like that 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.940
 rarely found stupid comments 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.590
 I'll show you here 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.540
 or then took them could do in peace 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.310
 Anyway, christ read this ball 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.380
 the anime with in my eyes perfect 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.849
 abstruse argumentation there I have to 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.010
 say it scares me a little bit 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.660
 but the commentators otherwise 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.519
 actually always quite animated criticisms 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.959
 but deliver it well it is probably synonymous 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.549
 one or the other the anime not 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.900
 I personally like it here 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.150
 in this place something incomprehensible 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.739
 but well as I said I can do the anime 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.389
 really only recommend he belongs like this 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.010
 pretty much the best series since 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.299
 was allowed to see for a long time 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.040
 that we looked necessarily times 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.599
 if you want us to do it 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.010
 like a comment or something similar 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.690
 but I'm always happy about it and how 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.950
 Of course, as always she said it 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.419
 that is my opinion if I the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.540
 do not like it then just do it 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.540
 suitable see you in the next video 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.540
