blinker holes and where's the keyhole
well<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.600> answer<00:01:26.930> is<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.350> took<00:01:27.530> all<00:01:27.740> these<00:01:27.950> and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
well the answer is we took all these and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.280 
well the answer is we took all these and
we<00:01:28.369> welded<00:01:29.119> them<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.420> fill<00:01:29.630> them<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.080> ground

we welded them and fill them and ground
them<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.770> then<00:01:30.860> prepared<00:01:31.310> them<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:31.549> chroming

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
them and then prepared them for chroming

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.510 
them and then prepared them for chroming
again<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.260> give<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.710> kind<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.010> classic

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
call them Avon death masters but this

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.160 
call them Avon death masters but this
bike<00:02:04.850> doesn't<00:02:05.150> really<00:02:05.270> go<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.630> fast<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.110> I'm

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
bike doesn't really go that fast so I'm

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.139 
bike doesn't really go that fast so I'm
not<00:02:06.320> too<00:02:06.470> worried<00:02:06.740> about<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.979> alright<00:02:07.430> so<00:02:07.490> if

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
you're looking at the exhaust on this

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.319 
you're looking at the exhaust on this
bike<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:10.310> know<00:02:10.429> again<00:02:10.700> kind<00:02:10.939> of<00:02:10.970> follow<00:02:11.209> in

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
bike you know again kind of follow in

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.270 
bike you know again kind of follow in
the<00:02:11.480> classic<00:02:11.959> look<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.200> we<00:02:12.439> were<00:02:12.590> going<00:02:12.829> for

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the classic look that we were going for

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.110 
the classic look that we were going for
we<00:02:14.090> went<00:02:14.270> with<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:15.130> modern<00:02:16.130> replica<00:02:16.370> that's

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
we went with a modern replica that's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.050 
we went with a modern replica that's
this<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.480> made<00:02:17.599> by

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
this is made by

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.540 
this is made by
customs<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.830> called<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.069> sleeper

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
customs it's there it's called a sleeper

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.640 
customs it's there it's called a sleeper
silencer<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.420> if<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.930> notice<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.380> looks<00:02:22.410> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
silencer and if you notice it looks a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.040 
silencer and if you notice it looks a
lot<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.550> classic<00:02:24.090> peashooter<00:02:24.660> mufflers

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
lot like the classic peashooter mufflers

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.870 
lot like the classic peashooter mufflers
that<00:02:25.110> were<00:02:25.349> on<00:02:25.500> these<00:02:25.680> Bonneville<00:02:26.190> 's<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that were on these Bonneville 's the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.580 
that were on these Bonneville 's the
only<00:02:27.060> difference<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.050> has<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> full

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
only difference is is that it has a full

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.370 
only difference is is that it has a full
performance<00:02:28.830> engineered<00:02:29.760> core<00:02:30.090> meaning<00:02:30.810> one

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
performance engineered core meaning one

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.320 
performance engineered core meaning one
it's<00:02:31.739> loud<00:02:32.069> which<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.819> cool

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it's loud which is cool

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.870 
it's loud which is cool
gives<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.349> better<00:02:34.470> performance<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
gives you better performance and it

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.820 
gives you better performance and it
helps<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> engine<00:02:36.360> breathe<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.530> these<00:02:37.650> are

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
helps the engine breathe so these are

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.460 
helps the engine breathe so these are
stock<00:02:38.069> headers<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.870> they're<00:02:39.870> made<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.319> to

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
stock headers and they're made it up to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.970 
stock headers and they're made it up to
these<00:02:40.620> pipes<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.489> tell<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.590> got<00:02:43.739> you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
these pipes and I tell you you got you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.100 
these pipes and I tell you you got you
if<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.459> want<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.790> can<00:02:44.940> start<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.019> you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
if you want we can start it up so you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.360 
if you want we can start it up so you
guys<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.290> hear<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.709> how's<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.099> sound

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.009 

now<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.580> mentioned<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> carbureted

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
now as I mentioned this is a carbureted

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.250 
now as I mentioned this is a carbureted
bike<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.530> not<00:02:52.620> fuel-injected<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.140> have

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
bike it's not fuel-injected so we have

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.170 
bike it's not fuel-injected so we have
to<00:02:55.410> do<00:02:55.530> things<00:02:55.830> like<00:02:56.010> turn<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.489> petcock<00:02:56.910> on

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
to do things like turn the petcock on

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.060 
to do things like turn the petcock on
and<00:02:58.610> give<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> little<00:02:59.880> throttle

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and give it a little throttle

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.289 
and give it a little throttle
[Music]

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
[Music]

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.539

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
biggest thing that we did to this bike

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.490 
biggest thing that we did to this bike
was<00:03:40.609> was<00:03:40.879> actually<00:03:41.030> take<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:41.540> stock<00:03:41.810> tank<00:03:42.199> and

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
was was actually take the stock tank and

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.979 
was was actually take the stock tank and
prep<00:03:42.889> it<00:03:42.919> and<00:03:43.280> have<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.359> entire<00:03:44.510> thing

chromed<00:03:46.359> we<00:03:47.359> then<00:03:47.599> after<00:03:48.379> it<00:03:48.439> was<00:03:48.560> chromed

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
chromed we then after it was chromed

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.599 
chromed we then after it was chromed
worked<00:03:49.879> with<00:03:50.060> our<00:03:50.209> painter<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:51.400> house<00:03:52.400> of

where<00:03:54.590> we<00:03:54.739> could<00:03:54.919> properly<00:03:55.400> etch<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.969> chrome

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
where we could properly etch the chrome

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.309 
where we could properly etch the chrome
in<00:03:56.810> order<00:03:57.199> to<00:03:57.290> get<00:03:57.469> this<00:03:57.709> rich<00:03:58.010> black<00:03:58.659> top<00:03:59.659> the

more of that vintage look because the

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.030 
more of that vintage look because the
