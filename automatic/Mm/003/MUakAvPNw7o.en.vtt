00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
center and the BioLite stove which is on

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.130 
center and the BioLite stove which is on
the<00:00:15.530> far<00:00:15.769> right<00:00:16.660> this<00:00:17.660> would<00:00:17.810> be<00:00:17.900> a<00:00:17.930> quick

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
the far right this would be a quick

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.570 
the far right this would be a quick
video<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:18.590> then<00:00:18.830> I'll<00:00:19.070> make<00:00:19.280> some<00:00:19.550> more

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
video and then I'll make some more

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:28.510 
video and then I'll make some more
in-depth<00:00:20.230> videos<00:00:21.230> later<00:00:21.830> on<00:00:26.320> so<00:00:27.340> first<00:00:28.340> we

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
in-depth videos later on so first we

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.520 
in-depth videos later on so first we
look<00:00:28.550> at<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:28.880> bio<00:00:29.060> light<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:32.150> has<00:00:32.300> three<00:00:32.720> legs

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
look at the bio light it has three legs

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.860 
look at the bio light it has three legs
that<00:00:33.770> extend<00:00:34.190> out<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:34.640> I'm<00:00:35.090> not<00:00:35.270> gonna<00:00:35.420> open

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
that extend out but I'm not gonna open

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.610 
that extend out but I'm not gonna open
them<00:00:36.110> up<00:00:36.200> right<00:00:36.410> now<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.440> unit<00:00:39.440> that

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
them up right now this is the unit that

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.140 
them up right now this is the unit that
has<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.010> blower<00:00:41.440> right<00:00:42.440> here<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.430> air<00:00:43.730> will

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
has the blower right here the air will

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.960 
has the blower right here the air will
be<00:00:44.239> sucked<00:00:44.480> in<00:00:44.690> from<00:00:44.750> here<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.640> it'll<00:00:46.640> shoot

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
be sucked in from here and it'll shoot

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.800 
be sucked in from here and it'll shoot
through<00:00:47.329> here<00:00:48.430> which<00:00:49.430> will<00:00:49.670> cause<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:49.940> swirling

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
through here which will cause a swirling

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.210 
through here which will cause a swirling
action<00:00:51.020> inside<00:00:51.820> makes<00:00:52.820> for<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.090> very<00:00:53.149> hot<00:00:53.540> fire

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
action inside makes for a very hot fire

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.710 
action inside makes for a very hot fire
it's<00:00:55.220> better<00:00:55.430> pieces<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:56.210> can<00:00:56.480> use<00:00:56.690> a

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
it's better pieces so you can use a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.569 
it's better pieces so you can use a
stainless<00:00:57.230> steel<00:00:57.260> cup<00:00:57.800> or<00:00:58.010> something<00:00:58.399> that's

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
stainless steel cup or something that's

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.709 
stainless steel cup or something that's
smaller<00:00:59.410> diameters<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.829> three

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
smaller diameters and the three

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.910 
smaller diameters and the three
triangular<00:01:03.460> rings<00:01:04.460> there<00:01:04.760> for<00:01:05.059> cooking<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.920> bio

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
triangular rings there for cooking a bio

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.670 
triangular rings there for cooking a bio
light<00:01:07.159> puts<00:01:07.460> out<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> lot<00:01:07.940> of<00:01:07.970> heat<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:09.530> can

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
light puts out a lot of heat you can

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.610 
light puts out a lot of heat you can
flip<00:01:09.920> open<00:01:10.100> this<00:01:10.430> rubber<00:01:10.700> tab<00:01:11.030> here<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.620> plug

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
flip open this rubber tab here and plug

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.410 
flip open this rubber tab here and plug
it<00:01:12.740> in<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.070> charge<00:01:13.100> your<00:01:13.460> cell<00:01:13.700> phone<00:01:14.000> or

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
it in the bag so in here is the original

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.429 
it in the bag so in here is the original
solo<00:01:33.080> stove<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:35.090> obviously<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.080> other<00:01:36.170> one

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
solo stove and obviously the other one

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.200 
solo stove and obviously the other one
is<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.770> new<00:01:36.920> solace<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.490> Titan<00:01:37.909> which<00:01:38.090> is

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
is the new solace of Titan which is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.520 
is the new solace of Titan which is
bigger<00:01:40.180> anyway<00:01:41.180> let's<00:01:41.390> take<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.810> quick<00:01:42.140> weight

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
bigger anyway let's take a quick weight

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.539 
bigger anyway let's take a quick weight
comparison

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.399 

iolite<00:01:52.549> weighs<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:53.030> at<00:01:53.150> two<00:01:53.360> point<00:01:53.720> eleven

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
iolite weighs in at two point eleven

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.320 
iolite weighs in at two point eleven
pounds

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
pounds

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:09.449 
pounds
2.11<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:59.180> titan<00:02:02.440> 1.14<00:02:03.500> pounds<00:02:07.929> solo<00:02:08.929> stove

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
2.11 the titan 1.14 pounds solo stove

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.430 
2.11 the titan 1.14 pounds solo stove
one<00:02:10.459> point<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:11.000> two<00:02:11.270> pounds<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.080> reason

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
one point to two pounds and the reason

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.759 
one point to two pounds and the reason
is<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:12.980> heavier<00:02:13.310> because<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:14.290> also<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
is it's heavier because I also have the

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.000 
is it's heavier because I also have the
cook<00:02:16.010> system<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.550> comes<00:02:16.760> with<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.890> that's<00:02:18.890> a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
cook system that comes with it that's a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:29.920 
cook system that comes with it that's a
second<00:02:19.400> don't<00:02:19.610> take<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:19.970> out<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
second don't take that out so the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.460 
second don't take that out so the
cooking<00:02:30.290> system<00:02:31.870> will<00:02:32.870> come<00:02:32.989> in<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.260> bag<00:02:33.440> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
cooking system will come in that bag and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.500 
cooking system will come in that bag and
the<00:02:33.739> biolite<00:02:34.130> stove<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.580> actually<00:02:34.970> fits

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510
