 dark chocolate 200 g of hazelnuts 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.930

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.790
 wafers that you find your shelves 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.440

 the chocolate you go the fools and for 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.670
 you think to put a parchment paper 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 you will put small pieces of 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 wafers well spread then you go 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 add almost all the hazelnuts 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 but left some still 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.539
 for the end i'm going to show you this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.750
 what are we going to do with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.790
 we now see the nutella so there 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.369
 it's a bit hard and to the east but also 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.030
 we will put after a few more 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 wafers now resort with 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 the rest of the melted chocolate you go 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.479
 Hazelnut 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.579
 so I crack them very 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.670
 roughly like that and still some 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.280
 good little pieces of hazelnut and 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.009
 time is the result 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.040
