of<00:04:18.850> articulation<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.380> think<00:04:20.680> back<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.280> the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
of articulation if you think back to the

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.570 
of articulation if you think back to the

this<00:05:23.830> figure<00:05:24.190> let<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.700> run<00:05:24.790> down<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.090> line<00:05:25.270> but

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
this figure let it run down the line but

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.660 
this figure let it run down the line but
for<00:05:26.170> now<00:05:26.320> this<00:05:26.560> figure<00:05:26.890> is<00:05:27.100> as<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.430> said

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
for now this figure is as I said

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.940 
for now this figure is as I said
definitely<00:05:27.940> at<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.450> best<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.140> most<00:05:29.500> superior
