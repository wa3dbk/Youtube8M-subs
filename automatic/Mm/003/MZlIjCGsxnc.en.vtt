talking about it on geek girl because it

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.499 
talking about it on geek girl because it

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
away too because this is the kind of

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.909 
away too because this is the kind of
series<00:06:44.460> where<00:06:45.030> main<00:06:45.389> characters<00:06:46.020> actually<00:06:46.319> do

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
series where main characters actually do

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.249 
series where main characters actually do
die<00:06:47.250> there's<00:06:48.180> about<00:06:48.419> two<00:06:48.750> dozen<00:06:48.780> main

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
die there's about two dozen main

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.870 
die there's about two dozen main
characters<00:06:49.710> so<00:06:49.889> they<00:06:50.009> have<00:06:50.220> many<00:06:50.430> characters

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
characters so they have many characters

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.629 
characters so they have many characters
to<00:06:51.090> spare<00:06:51.419> but<00:06:52.050> every<00:06:52.979> time<00:06:53.159> they<00:06:53.220> get<00:06:53.520> in

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639
