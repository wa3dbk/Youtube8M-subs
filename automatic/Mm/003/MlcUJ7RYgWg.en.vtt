00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.349
 super super easy too super fast and 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.600
 with things that are not so difficult to 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.790
 get the truth all this idea was born 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.800
 because last week I just went 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.130
 Wanda concert and Serbian version 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.470
 of you was I am not like super 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.630
 super fan but I really like it 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.520
 then our nail tutorial for 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.110
 the holidays and they are directional as well as 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.730
 of red bone can be that many 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.380
 girls like it then I started to 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.360
 present this idea is also not 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.310
 only for directions you 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.930
 they can do it for what they did was 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.490
 you can also do with photos 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.470
 with photos or what you like 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.700
 maybe super easy I hope you like it 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.620
 much and low of tongue 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.140
 we are going to need small images of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.480
 internet let's go to doubles look for what 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.060
 that we want later we are going to stick it in 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.190
 word we are going to make a very image 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.390
 little girl and then nothing else we're going 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.460
 inaccuracies 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.079
 we're also going to need subtle tweeter 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.280
 and appointments of nail polish and in 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.280
 catcher for many 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.090
 let's do normal French in all 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.070
 our nails with the color that we want 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.040
 - in the nail where we are going to put the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.110
 that image we are going to paint it full 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.820
 later so that he does not fall so much 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.420
 color we are going to put encapsuladora in 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.420
 all the leaves 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.369
 we are going to put encapsuladora in the nail 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.380
 to use it as glue with the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.840
 crisis let's put the image we're going to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.689
 tighten it and give it a little bit of shape 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.119
 and then we will cover it with another 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:47.130
 encapsulated layer and that is super super 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.130
 covered so you do not run 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.180
