 the pillory clown leads a group of 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.639
 street artists that aspires to have 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.670
 social security rights of the 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.039
 monotributo that gender is now for 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.680
 glass cleaners and car care 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.840
 for the street artist who goes up all 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.210
 the days to a bus to demonstrate its 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.950
 Art not enter backwards 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.890
 the goal is that jugglers musicians 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.870
 acrobats and clowns can formalize their 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.969
 activity the representative of the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.730
 workers in the bps ramÃ³n ruiz 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.679
 attended the meetings in the pit cnt and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.449
 he assured that they work in a solution 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.550
 to make their contributions with the 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.499
 monotributo system the artists 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.510
 Street workers also ask for support 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.579
 institutional of public organizations 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.129
 to be hired at mass events 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.140
 as for example for opening acts in 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.670
 We have fought for 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.109
 that what happens that they wear takes the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.690
 time it takes time to 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.940
 time and now with the president who 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.699
 comes to be the push let's try to 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.159
 claim work rights we do not have 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.080
 a stable work this the artist 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.530
 street is that nothing love 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.490
 omnibus there is theater does not have 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.979
 really no this no any 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.110
 sure no contribution and we are good 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:25.479
 looking for that when I go back to 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:31.330
 find we can smile I prefer 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:36.720
 to see you depart as you see you arrive when 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.940
 think again that once I met you 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.080
 and that no more because 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:50.940
 I composed you a song will sing in your 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.940
 I heart how little I gave you 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.700
