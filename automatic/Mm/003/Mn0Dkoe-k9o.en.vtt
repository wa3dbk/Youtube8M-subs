00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello I'm sina already knew that 70 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.950
 percent of people are to scooter and 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.860
 The tongue can roll to a tube 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.130
 and 30 of the people are not scooters 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.049
 and are unable to do so and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 did you know that some people 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.880
 pigments in skin hairs and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.300
 theirs in the eye are missing these 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.279
 Disease is called albinism am 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 example of the tongue roll and the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.660
 I want you in this alpinism 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.759
 video explaining the family tree analysis 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.890
 You should already have the Mendelian 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 rules know cross-in schema 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.360
 understand and can create and the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.879
 terms dominant recessive phenotype 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.879
 genotype allel and get to know each other well 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 I will first explain what 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 family tree analysis is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.620
 then I will give you the usual 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.579
 Symbols of a family tree analysis 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.469
 imagine 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.629
 and finally the example of the tongue 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.270
 rolls a dominant inheritance and am 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.309
 example of alpinism a recessive 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.309
 declare departure to pedigrees 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 we come to the first point what is 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.479
 Actually, root tree analysis one can 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.970
 analyze the family tree 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 and thereby of the phenotype of the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.030
 appearance on the genotype so 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.040
 the genetic makeup of a person 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.430
 the full movie and many more 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 you can find on sofatutor.com about 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.280
 7,000 videos tell you what you are up to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 Good grades need to know about testing 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.920
 your knowledge after every video real 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.920
 Teachers help you in daily live chat 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.780
 immediately with your problem

 You can also attend private lessons 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.399
 book your personal online tutor 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.610
 to dive deeper into a topic 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.490
 So we help you with your censorship without 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.100
