developed with another couple of people
the<00:00:58.680> bio<00:00:58.890> find<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.870> simple

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the bio find and it's just a simple

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.650 
the bio find and it's just a simple
machine<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.829> goes<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> waist<00:01:02.670> with

machine that goes around the waist with

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.200 
machine that goes around the waist with
a<00:01:03.690> comb-like<00:01:04.470> head<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.729> run<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a comb-like head and you just run the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
a comb-like head and you just run the
comb<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.780> sensor<00:01:07.350> over<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> body<00:01:08.040> the

comb like sensor over the body the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
comb like sensor over the body the
sensor<00:01:09.060> puts<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:10.080> low<00:01:10.290> microcurrent<00:01:11.070> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
sensor puts a very low microcurrent of

sensor puts a very low microcurrent of
energy<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> body<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.450> where<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.080> body

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
energy into the body and where the body

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
energy into the body and where the body
is<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> homeostasis<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.610> everything's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
is in homeostasis and everything's

particular<00:01:17.670> activity<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> comes<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
particular activity if it comes to a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
particular activity if it comes to a
point<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:20.220> bruised<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> brain<00:01:21.659> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
point that's bruised and the brain is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.929 
point that's bruised and the brain is
calling<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.530> calcium<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.340> things<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> heal

calling for calcium and things to heal

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.999 
calling for calcium and things to heal
it<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.330> lot<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> activity<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.770> when

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it there's a lot of activity that's when

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.940 
it there's a lot of activity that's when
the<00:01:26.130> sensor<00:01:26.430> beam<00:01:26.820> changes<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.689> speed<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the sensor beam changes at speed and you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.800 
the sensor beam changes at speed and you
can<00:01:29.130> hear<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> digital

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
can hear it and see it on the digital

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
can hear it and see it on the digital
readout<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.159> scanning<00:01:32.490> over<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
readout so as you're scanning over the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
readout so as you're scanning over the
horse<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> come<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> high<00:01:34.170> squeal<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
horse when you come to a high squeal you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.710 
horse when you come to a high squeal you
take<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.369> water<00:01:35.610> color<00:01:35.909> crayon<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
take a little water color crayon put a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.580 
take a little water color crayon put a
little<00:01:36.840> mark<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.380> continue<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:39.380> find<00:01:40.380> quite

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
little mark and continue on I find quite

been a big help to me I think one of the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.670 
been a big help to me I think one of the
greatest<00:02:53.239> joys<00:02:53.599> is<00:02:53.840> getting<00:02:54.109> all<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.349> letters

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
greatest joys is getting all the letters

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.530 
greatest joys is getting all the letters
and<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.040> excitement<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.730> people<00:02:56.030> calling

that<00:02:59.569> we<00:02:59.780> can't<00:03:00.049> even<00:03:00.230> repeat<00:03:00.620> because<00:03:01.159> people

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
that we can't even repeat because people

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.920 
that we can't even repeat because people
would<00:03:01.579> think<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.909> we<00:03:02.150> were<00:03:02.239> making<00:03:02.629> them<00:03:02.750> up

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930
