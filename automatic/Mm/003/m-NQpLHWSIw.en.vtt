00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.560
 and 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello to all guy welcome 6 I'll upload 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.269
 with the king of the track a section the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.700
 which can vary the one that carries the crown 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.920
 depending on the outcome of the combat in 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 this week continues with the love crown the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.300
 that is on the run going very, very, very 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.699
 well but you have to try to take it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 said position the challenger decides it in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.660
 Morla by means of a draw of a page 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.520
 web you challenge him and simón or he puts it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.529
 all in one hype included me that too 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.110
 I challenge you always who stays with the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.820
 crown this fat week or the lugo 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 challenger we go there 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.229
 the new challenger starts by throwing his 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 pokemon that is joanito new challenger and 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.420
 man down from austin and on the other hand 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.949
 of mor sends it to his so powerful 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.010
 except the one that as many of us already know 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.989
 it is not to accept and it is only mine except a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 pokémon calm skill for rays 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.580
 so I was very calm from the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.769
 possible paralysis of semi-Austin leader 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.690
 the new challenger can get the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.339
 crown this new challenger we will know in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.869
 this combat his I like that is me 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.869
 using usa screen to upload 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.939
 the special defense 50% because I 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.409
 I spent the dail as you are checking 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.220
 before some impulse dragon attack that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.020
 get this one 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.930
 because he wants the kind of mild aragon of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.930
 thunder wave is not the best option because 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.460
 compares rays accepts the mega climbs the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.830
 Special attack by 1 element other 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.110
 dragon pulse tenth most powerful by 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.480
 now he harasses me, but he's going to 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.740
 eat another dragon pulse because I austin 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.990
 normally a screen wants is in 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.180
 have them safer person endure and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 mind a psychic ame gaceta the so 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 unless Austin has put a screen 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.540
 of light and a psychic to test the ps 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 of that mega zeta and eye before 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.490
 weaken protects by the physical part 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.410
 I liked that too and with a reflection 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.660
 gazette he finishes it with a giga of swim 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.300
 although there are very few more 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.190
 they are going to recover 2 tps that nothing so 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.260
 I like that the first pokemon of this 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.960
 the king of the new rival's court 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.420
 challenger falls juanito takes out his next 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.759
 pokemon 6 hours that can face 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.820
 more shadows or mega quote I think so 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.640
 because above I do not know six hours mega 6 or 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.830
 against megas of type two mega mega 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.510
 face-to-face evolutions we will see who is 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.030
 take the cat to the water ' for now I 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.830
 gazette the stick very strong but remember 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.350
 who has defenses his life 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.120
 earthquake this will totally stop 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.100
 misplaced maybe for pokemon type 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.530
 fire has that attack a little neutral 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.290
 a bit mixed that mega zlm one way and 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.990
 turn very effective because it is plant type 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.750
 and mega 6 orca quietly endures the 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.090
 Mega earthquake effort on teilón and 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.140
 they are one on one but they have to 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.030
 see with your coach 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.490
 Juanito takes out a man or a pokémon 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.190
 sinister type tank holds up very well 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.080
 over has with the barriers increased 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.170
 attention that is finished island tambourine outside 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.180
 comes out together the rare pokémon to see by 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.160
 morla part of their weird pokemones 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.959
 see it united a Juanito protection for 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.630
 groping to see what he's going to do is 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.810
 together the one that puts a screw in goes up the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.030
 Attack the defense and accuracy by one 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.370
 is now much stronger and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.250
 hold more physical blows and apart 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.350
 can not fail uses dirty game picks 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.820
 and hit him with his attack he takes away 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.580
 Pretty positive life is going up 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.959
 and the defense attack goes up again 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.670
 the precision 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.410
 cautito a brawn for very tank that 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.269
 either the shifts are happening that 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.980
 the reflection is going and next to him 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.490
 every time he has more attack he is 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.190
 curing 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.440
 with remains you can hold peacefully 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.270
 against is man or uses of that man 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.280
 it still does not seem right to you can be 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.770
 seeing a pretty powerful hit or you can 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.570
 be that pokemon change attention 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.880
 next to him yes that will change yes but 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.890
 with relief will happen to all are 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.350
 uploaded to the next pokemon that is a 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.910
 clean clan if clinic by itself already has 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.220
 quite attack pretty defense what 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.350
 just up the reflection has gone and 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.360
 clean can only needed this 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.430
 a gear change to get on 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.310
 all the speed and even a little bit more 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.770
 the physical attack has still clean is 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.970
 super posted dirty game there was 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.680
 movement aside from juanito for 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.870
 hit him with his physical attack the removes 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.880
 an outrage if it endured thresholds of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.070
 double wheel steel type you also get 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.690
 my mother's eggs more than half 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.870
 break band focus a liking decided the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.820
 second wheel double man or can not stand 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.220
 clinton the first pokemon that has 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.930
 Rival of the rival is a pawn loses a 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.160
 little life by life sphere can 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.190
 hold a little longer some turns 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.360
 that celestial clan naut the safest thing is 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.800
 make a spinoza barrier so that 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.440
 you paste the only incidentally indicated 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.830
 much the color male sweep just not 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.809
 it was clear now if he tries to attack 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.819
 It is protecting very well but not by 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:37.770
 they had to use spinoza barrier 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.749
 and already take the turn to put another 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.270
 second gear shift speed and to the 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:45.839
 has the clouds and the attack posted 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.330
 by two not twice as much together and as 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:50.699
 clint who have voted twice rolls 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.879
 double in the middle of life and the second 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.069
 double wheel can not stand schnautz other 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.349
 pokemon that adds to the sack of the 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.059
 weakened clint have taken and I 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.339
 Austin and remember that it has also fallen 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:04.379
 he has three pokemon to juanito that 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.969
 scoring a goal if he has an attack 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.979
 priority can enable that fifth 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.930
 is very touched but attention is not what 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.209
 has clean change going to attack with wheel 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.800
 double a low and go to once if you have 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:17.159
 band empower just departed as is 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.439
 the case and the second blow weakens you 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.659
 clean clan and board are destroying 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.580
 all strategy of the rival in this case 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.439
 Juanito loses a little more life by 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.360
 life outside and the next blow 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.099
 it can fall who great go out there mega 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.110
 just to put some order in 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.719
 so bright percent chaos I said 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.479
 before and attention fist bullet although it is not 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.169
 very effective he was very touched clean clan 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.389
 Enough 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.340
 Destruction has made that love clinic 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.580
 he has shown it with the relay and double 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.889
 gear change thousand england drops more 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.590
 mortal a pokémon that can not even see nor 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.659
 in painting 6 now because it has fire what 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.759
 he withdraws his next Pokémon that is 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.860
 a millot and good changes has seen that 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.689
 flamethrower and can with biotic endured 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.909
 calmly and it will hit more vote 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.289
 so the flamethrower to mirotic does not 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.749
 will remove virtually nothing of life 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.569
 careful not to burn you is not the case and 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:09.120
 attention because surprise marmot has 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.249
 ray I already knew it puts a ray to me 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.740
 lot and leaves it very grounded uses 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.270
 toxic I think that here instead of putting 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.800
 a toxic that may be that Juanito does not 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.659
 I expected that ray I 've got 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.400
 directly a scalar pass the quite 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.110
 year the water type attack a thread pump what 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.879
 that is it loses a little life with 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.060
 toxic and the strategy that uses 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:30.330
 johnny and the second deadliest ray will 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.069
 charge to me lot and another pokemon less for 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.529
 part of the monkey that has all the 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.560
 destroyed pillars morla is very 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.150
 calm with the crown until almost 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.219
 breathing relieve and ximo because the 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.639
 last john pokemon that is mega 6 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:45.979
 or add motor even though this one 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.110
 or you can use it only at one stroke 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:50.090
 if you hold it a yo bullet with multi 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.029
 movement of the mega sensor of Juanito 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.499
 it takes away a little bit of life and attention 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:56.779
 body call can not touch more 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:58.069
 kill with physical attacks what most 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:00.219
 the physical attack decreased but it was already 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:03.439
 the same because this piece of flamethrower 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:05.749
 mega 6 now the last pokemon of the new 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:08.120
