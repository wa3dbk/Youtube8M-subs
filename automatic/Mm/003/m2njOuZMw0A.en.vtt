00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:09.070
 Hi, youtube people , how are you? 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:11.499
 I'm glad that I made a video here. 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.259
 of disassembled control 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:18.940
 I'll also talk about the 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:21.610
 cpu computer that for some few 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:28.840
 Bothering me, I had one. 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:31.900
 core 2 duo 7 500 with gts 450 and fgts 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.019
 she warms up, it's not too much for me 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.570
 here it got very hot then I solved 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.879
 make a good cooling system 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 Basque even show you that maybe 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.260
 may have the same problem as my 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.319
 today I bought this other computer and 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:00.579
 Go the first thing he says I 'm going 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.789
 do is buy this ac source that has 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.490
 this cure that also serves as an exhaust fan 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:13.640
 to draw hot air from inside 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.800
 So I bought this source that donated 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.420
 you do not have anything to like me too xavier 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.860
 attending quiet but not solved 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.180
 totally the problem of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.040
 overheating 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.130
 they told me that I had to put 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.070
 a cooler here you can see this part 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.530
 I brought akita, I will not show it to you. 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.619
 to bring the club is here judging 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.710
 air out 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.690
 I put the cooler also put not 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.020
 resolved 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.399
 the board already has its cooler that does not 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.369
 Can you relate to so well, huh? 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:57.590
 but if I had an engineer too 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:00.490
 fry what I did then it was that with 2 hd 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.110
 of 1tb each 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.570
 I put it there, I do not know if it will 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.679
 you come here 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:15.739
 in action is also bad but the flashlight that 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:19.100
 I can show they can see 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:24.459
 there is a cooler I bought another college 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.459
 national he is 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.850
 there is already an opening for him that enters 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.930
 I pull the cold here from below to inside the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.080
 cpu and already cooling thank you already passed 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.120
 to cool the hds and I 'm coming 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.910
 there is cold here inside 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.900
 and here on the lid I put another course 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.720
 Also pull a cold from outside to inside 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.520
 board playing directly on the board then 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.370
 wish to cool the plate well then 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.490
 hood here will serve more to take away 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.110
 the hot air it generates in the processor 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.380
 then that part that is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.910
 all refrigerated but still not 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.790
 now a little hard the hot air goes up 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.700
 then this pack that the warm air stayed 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.160
 much here then and then circulated 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:30.160
 hood that was little more one here in 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.100
 and pulling hot air into the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.310
 That's where I solved my problem. 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.390
 my plate she was about 75 degrees 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.550
 easy not 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.350
 only on flickr might play a good still 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.350
 overclocking on base but now 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:55.360
 now it's not quiet is in the range of 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:04:02.230
 60 56 in the cold freezes even gets very 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.730
 good because the direct connect resolve the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.060
 problem 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.140
 Cold air enters here below pulls 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.510
 underneath the hot air already rises and this 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.330
 here pulls all the hot air out 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.690
 a tip for example I put this course 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.669
 here is connected directly to the source 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.420
 so the spin does not know why but 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.990
 it seems that the rotation slightly smaller 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.810
 so how do I want to cool your uncle? 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.840
 place the school had already 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:40.890
 You 'll see that the place 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:43.350
 where the guide is a club without on the motherboard 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.200
 which already apply cury the newspaper then 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.720
 this little place here you give 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.830
 preferably to place the hood right 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.150
 because it will generate faster and will 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.920
 remove hot air more easily 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.740
 even a little messy but something that 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.540
 can help also my children are 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.390
 well positioned 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.390
 I got to do with these kids here. 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:16.250
 It was just that for me not to be 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:19.170
 very messy staff solved 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.780
 Calm, I'm happy with this. 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.000
 computer other vin co 2 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.970
 also had the same system 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.190
 this here already comes with the opening of a 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.190
 multilaser cabinet also very good 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.940
 very good 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.790
 I found it beautiful to bear 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.620
 it already comes with the only opening I had 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.350
 cut that piece of plastic but the 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.000
 cabinet was open and another 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.660
 cabinet I had a core 2 duo did not 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.910
 had and did not have this opening in x she 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.280
 can do 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.680
 and worked quiet also worked 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.550
 that same door that I have here 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:12.030
 other of the same street problem 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.220
 then it's cool 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.050
 very good has solved this problem that I 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.510
 I have to overheat 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:24.450
 now it 's roasting the heat that it is 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:31.500
 that it already works a good with personal 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:36.380
 This is it, I'm in a team but this problem is 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:39.000
 now just share with you leave 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.850
 of that 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.990
 this idea and accept who has 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:50.720
 no problem 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:50.720
 Okay, so it has more projection.
