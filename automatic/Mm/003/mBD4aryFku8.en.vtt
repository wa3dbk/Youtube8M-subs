00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
the bentall and if you put the strength

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.730 
the bentall and if you put the strength
up<00:02:04.000> start<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.180> bend<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.440> text<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:11.620> think<00:02:12.620> this

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
up start to bend the text I think this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.530 
up start to bend the text I think this
is<00:02:12.920> also<00:02:13.100> how<00:02:13.280> they<00:02:13.580> made<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.000> flat<00:02:14.330> line

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
is also how they made the flat line

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.190 
is also how they made the flat line

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
and take the strength and put it up to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.090 
and take the strength and put it up to
about<00:02:38.270> 320<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.519> get<00:02:40.519> this<00:02:40.640> giant<00:02:40.940> blob<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.660> text

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
about 320 I get this giant blob of text

trick here select all the keyframes by

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.740 
trick here select all the keyframes by
just<00:04:11.610> sliding<00:04:11.700> like<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.390> put<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.630> to
