sheiks I know there's some cool
technology<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:23.970> board<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.359> well<00:00:24.839> we've<00:00:24.990> done

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
technology on board here well we've done

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
technology on board here well we've done
a<00:00:25.230> lot<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> shoe<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> mean<00:00:26.490> there's<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
a lot to the shoe so I mean there's a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.070 
a lot to the shoe so I mean there's a
lot<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.970> talk<00:00:27.119> about<00:00:27.179> i<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
lot to talk about i think first and

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.679 
lot to talk about i think first and
foremost<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.769> Boost<00:00:29.249> technology<00:00:29.880> boost<00:00:30.480> is

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
foremost is Boost technology boost is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690 
foremost is Boost technology boost is
new<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.050> golf<00:00:31.259> and<00:00:31.499> it's<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:31.980> revolutionary

new to golf and it's a revolutionary

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.790 
new to golf and it's a revolutionary
midsole<00:00:33.180> cushioning<00:00:33.570> technology<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:34.680> gives

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
midsole cushioning technology that gives

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.290 
midsole cushioning technology that gives
you<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> lot<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.190> advantages<00:00:35.730> we're<00:00:36.060> now<00:00:36.180> we're

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you a lot of advantages we're now we're

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.390 
you a lot of advantages we're now we're
talking<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:37.050> energy<00:00:37.440> return<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.250> when

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
talking about more energy return so when

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.860 
talking about more energy return so when
you<00:00:38.490> push<00:00:38.730> against<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> gives<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.600> more

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you push against it it gives you more

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930 
you push against it it gives you more
back<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.680> talking<00:00:40.830> about<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> foam<00:00:41.490> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
back we're talking about a foam that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.550 
back we're talking about a foam that
doesn't<00:00:42.300> change<00:00:42.330> elasticity<00:00:43.110> due<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
doesn't change elasticity due to

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.320 
doesn't change elasticity due to
temperature<00:00:43.860> changes<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.790> it's<00:00:44.910> cold<00:00:45.150> out

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
temperature changes so if it's cold out

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.000 
temperature changes so if it's cold out
or<00:00:45.450> hot<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> same<00:00:46.440> consistent

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
or hot out you get the same consistent

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.980 
or hot out you get the same consistent
cushioning<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.180> durable<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
cushioning it's more durable so it

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.360 
cushioning it's more durable so it
doesn't<00:00:49.170> break<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.500> time<00:00:49.710> it's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
doesn't break down over time it's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.610 
doesn't break down over time it's
lighter<00:00:50.700> than<00:00:50.820> traditional<00:00:51.360> UVA<00:00:51.630> at<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.440> end

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
lighter than traditional UVA at the end

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.840 
lighter than traditional UVA at the end
of<00:00:52.740> the<00:00:52.830> day<00:00:53.010> we've<00:00:53.250> done<00:00:53.370> our<00:00:53.400> consumer

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
of the day we've done our consumer

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.830 
of the day we've done our consumer
insight<00:00:54.120> research<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.630> we<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.810> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
insight research and we know that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
insight research and we know that
comfort<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.710> probably<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> number<00:00:56.730> one

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
comfort is probably the number one

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
comfort is probably the number one

shoes<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.500> past<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> reason

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280

laughing about almost like this is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.160 
laughing about almost like this is
ridiculous<00:01:36.390> i<00:01:36.540> feel<00:01:36.690> like<00:01:36.780> i<00:01:36.840> could<00:01:36.930> go<00:01:37.080> off

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
