it's the eos-1d x for extreme

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.589 
it's the eos-1d x for extreme
awesomeness<00:00:10.860> maybe<00:00:11.790> again<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.450> main

iso below of 3200 can do 14 frames a
second<00:00:28.529> which<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.680> phenomenal<00:00:29.250> those<00:00:29.910> are

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
second which is phenomenal those are

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
second which is phenomenal those are
having<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> bit<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> an<00:00:30.779> awesome<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.890> going

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
having a bit of an awesome I so going

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.660 
having a bit of an awesome I so going
from<00:00:32.250> 100<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.149> fifty<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:34.219> thousand<00:00:35.219> iso

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
from 100 up to fifty one thousand iso

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.580 
from 100 up to fifty one thousand iso
and<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.270> also<00:00:36.390> giving<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.690> extendable

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and it's also giving you extendable

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.770 
and it's also giving you extendable
versions<00:00:37.950> at<00:00:38.070> either<00:00:38.160> end<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.730> go<00:00:38.879> 250

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
versions at either end so you can go 250

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
versions at either end so you can go 250
I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.440> also<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:43.370> 200,000<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.760> oh

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
I think and also up to 200,000 is oh

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.130 
I think and also up to 200,000 is oh
there's<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:45.539> something<00:00:45.690> quite<00:00:45.960> interesting

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
there's also something quite interesting

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.440 
there's also something quite interesting
about<00:00:46.500> its<00:00:46.680> focal<00:00:47.160> ability<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.300> also

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
about its focal ability or it's also

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.110 
about its focal ability or it's also
focuses<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.140> 61<00:00:49.620> focal<00:00:50.340> points<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
focuses got 61 focal points on the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.850 
focuses got 61 focal points on the
actual<00:00:51.360> sensor<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.110> they're<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.410> different

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
actual sensor but they're for different

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
actual sensor but they're for different
types<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.340> f-stops<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.899> gives<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.289> confusing

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
types of f-stops this gives be confusing

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
types of f-stops this gives be confusing
normally<00:00:56.100> your<00:00:56.399> focal<00:00:57.239> things<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.350> usually

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
normally your focal things are usually

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.619 
normally your focal things are usually
for<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.800> f<00:00:58.920> 2.8<00:00:59.190> lenses<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.120> something<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
for like f 2.8 lenses or something that

for like f 2.8 lenses or something that
nobody<00:01:01.260> understands<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.010> one's<00:01:02.219> got

nobody understands but this one's got
focal<00:01:02.969> points<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.480> work<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.379> f-stops

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
focal points we can work up to f-stops

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.030 
focal points we can work up to f-stops
of<00:01:05.460> f<00:01:05.640> 5.6<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> means<00:01:07.799> but

mark 3 kind of rail this is a bit too
big<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.020> video<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.070> imagined<00:01:44.460> as

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.039 
big for video I would have imagined as
of<00:01:44.880> yet<00:01:45.030> there's<00:01:45.060> no<00:01:45.360> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.630> story<00:01:45.869> about

of yet there's no kind of story about

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.710 
of yet there's no kind of story about
how<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> dynamic<00:01:47.399> range<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
how good the dynamic range is in the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.969 
how good the dynamic range is in the

megapixel full-frame sensor and so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.109 
megapixel full-frame sensor and so
that's<00:01:52.680> still<00:01:53.100> something<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> needs

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
that's still something up when it needs

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.240 
that's still something up when it needs
to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.240> tested<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> seen<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.619> itself<00:01:55.890> one

to be tested out and seen for itself one

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.649 
to be tested out and seen for itself one
other<00:01:56.369> thing<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:57.119> trying<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> say

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
other thing is that is trying to say

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.270 
other thing is that is trying to say

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
that because of such a professional body

which is is tested up to 400,000 shutter
actuation<00:02:05.280> actuations<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> ask<00:02:06.479> me

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
actuation actuations but if you ask me

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.990 
actuation actuations but if you ask me
it<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.810> quite<00:02:07.409> phenomenal<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.459> I'd<00:02:08.580> be

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it is quite phenomenal and I'd be

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
it is quite phenomenal and I'd be
surprised<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.690> anybody<00:02:10.530> uses

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
surprised if anybody uses

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
surprised if anybody uses
camera<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.239> amount<00:02:12.270> unless<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.349> are

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
camera up to that amount unless they are

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
camera up to that amount unless they are
and<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.069> fan<00:02:14.250> photographer<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:14.880> unless<00:02:15.060> you're

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
and a fan photographer so unless you're

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.850 
and a fan photographer so unless you're
shooting<00:02:15.660> sports<00:02:15.959> every<00:02:16.349> week<00:02:16.500> where<00:02:16.739> you're

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
shooting sports every week where you're

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.620 
shooting sports every week where you're
going<00:02:17.130> over<00:02:17.280> taking<00:02:17.580> two<00:02:17.880> thousand<00:02:18.239> photos<00:02:18.420> of

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
going over taking two thousand photos of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.699 
going over taking two thousand photos of
people<00:02:18.840> running<00:02:18.959> past<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> finish<00:02:19.470> line<00:02:19.680> or

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
people running past the finish line or

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.350 
people running past the finish line or
some<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.130> then<00:02:20.640> okay<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.209> might<00:02:21.300> be

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
some of that then okay you might be

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.330 
some of that then okay you might be
going<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.690> 400,000<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.950> probably<00:02:23.160> did

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
going up to 400,000 but you probably did

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.070 
going up to 400,000 but you probably did
a<00:02:23.430> batch<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.060> cameras<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.599> much<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:24.959> we

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
a batch of the cameras so much if we

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.680 
a batch of the cameras so much if we
even<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.730> 400,000<00:02:26.730> anyways<00:02:27.209> let's<00:02:27.239> test<00:02:27.599> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
even get 400,000 anyways let's test it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.120 
even get 400,000 anyways let's test it
to<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.870> could<00:02:27.989> always<00:02:28.110> do<00:02:28.290> much<00:02:28.800> more<00:02:29.069> than

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
to you could always do much more than

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.979 
to you could always do much more than
that<00:02:29.370> or<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.000> could<00:02:30.120> always<00:02:30.330> die<00:02:30.569> before<00:02:30.810> that

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
that or it could always die before that

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.870 
that or it could always die before that
so<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.500> stays<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.340> kind<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.519> what<00:02:32.730> it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
so it stays that is just kind of what it

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.430 
so it stays that is just kind of what it
says<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> should<00:02:33.510> be<00:02:33.630> able<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.959> roughly<00:02:34.200> do

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
says it should be able to roughly do

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 
says it should be able to roughly do
four<00:02:35.310> hundred<00:02:35.519> thousand<00:02:35.819> other<00:02:36.030> means<00:02:36.360> of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
four hundred thousand other means of

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.330 
four hundred thousand other means of
anybody<00:02:37.019> actually<00:02:37.260> gets<00:02:37.620> up<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.040> number

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
anybody actually gets up to that number

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.339 
anybody actually gets up to that number
or<00:02:38.580> photos<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.420> for<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.660> majority<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.200> you

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
or photos so for the majority of you

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.259 
or photos so for the majority of you
this<00:02:40.560> camera<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.280> no<00:02:41.640> importance

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
this camera is of no importance

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.580 
this camera is of no importance
whatsoever<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.870> camera<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> be

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
whatsoever this camera is going to be

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.340 
whatsoever this camera is going to be
well<00:02:44.220> advertised<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.850> six<00:02:45.200> thousand<00:02:46.200> dollars

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
well advertised at six thousand dollars

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.190 
well advertised at six thousand dollars
so<00:02:47.069> it's<00:02:47.340> way<00:02:47.760> beyond<00:02:48.180> what<00:02:48.209> anybody<00:02:48.690> wanting

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
so it's way beyond what anybody wanting

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.860 
so it's way beyond what anybody wanting
and<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.920> nothing<00:02:50.370> I'd<00:02:50.489> be<00:02:50.670> every<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.150> thinking

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
and so nothing I'd be every you thinking

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.590 
and so nothing I'd be every you thinking
of<00:02:52.019> paying<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:53.459> poems<00:02:54.239> I'll<00:02:54.420> probably

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
of paying for and in poems I'll probably

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.120 
of paying for and in poems I'll probably
come<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.110> robbie<00:02:55.350> renwick<00:02:55.680> four<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.099> a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
come up with robbie renwick four and a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.089 
come up with robbie renwick four and a
half<00:02:56.160> grands<00:02:57.030> worth<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.540> money<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.830> kind<00:02:59.010> of

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
half grands worth of money this kind of

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.880 
half grands worth of money this kind of
takes<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.670> both<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.450> areas<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.989> where<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> 1d

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
takes in both the areas of where the 1d

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.520 
takes in both the areas of where the 1d
s<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.640> 1d<00:03:03.150> used<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.470> of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
s and the 1d used to be so it's kind of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.800 
s and the 1d used to be so it's kind of
bits<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.400> both<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.970> don't<00:03:06.180> know<00:03:06.269> if<00:03:06.420> cannon

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
bits of both and I don't know if cannon

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.570 
bits of both and I don't know if cannon
will<00:03:06.900> be<00:03:06.989> announcing<00:03:07.349> another<00:03:07.530> camera<00:03:07.980> like

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
will be announcing another camera like

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.670 
will be announcing another camera like
this<00:03:08.610> where<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.330> one<00:03:09.510> DX<00:03:09.900> s<00:03:10.230> I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
this where it's like the one DX s I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.120 
this where it's like the one DX s I
don't<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.750> maybe<00:03:12.750> maybe<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.040> think

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
don't know I maybe maybe not but I think

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.590 
don't know I maybe maybe not but I think
they<00:03:14.340> want<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.549> see<00:03:14.640> how<00:03:14.790> well<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.209> one<00:03:15.390> goes

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
they want to see how well this one goes

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.330 
they want to see how well this one goes
before<00:03:15.810> they<00:03:16.079> have<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.320> like<00:03:16.530> put<00:03:16.920> out<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> new

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
before they have to like put out a new

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.440 
before they have to like put out a new
one<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.670> last<00:03:17.910> question<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.390> it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
one the last question is is it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.240 
one the last question is is it
revolution<00:03:19.049> or<00:03:19.140> isn't<00:03:19.500> evilish<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.070> would

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
revolution or isn't evilish I would

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.060 
revolution or isn't evilish I would
really<00:03:20.519> say<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.060> cannon<00:03:21.690> bear<00:03:22.140> 1d

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
really say that the cannon bear 1d

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.060 
really say that the cannon bear 1d
series<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.910> an<00:03:24.299> awesome<00:03:25.049> range<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.739> cameras

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
series is an awesome range of cameras

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.880 
series is an awesome range of cameras
i've<00:03:26.160> got<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.720> revolution<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.680> fact

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
i've got this is a revolution the fact

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.680 
i've got this is a revolution the fact
that<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.160> effectively<00:03:29.549> both<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.269> best<00:03:30.450> of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
that is effectively both the best of

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.050 
that is effectively both the best of
both<00:03:30.870> worlds<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.769> in<00:03:31.920> terms<00:03:32.220> same<00:03:32.910> time

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
both worlds but in terms same time

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.550 
both worlds but in terms same time
that's<00:03:33.209> really<00:03:33.420> kind<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:33.690> an<00:03:33.930> evolution

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
that's really kind of just an evolution

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.770 
that's really kind of just an evolution
of<00:03:34.739> merging<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.549> great<00:03:35.970> camera<00:03:36.269> with<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> better

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
of merging a great camera with a better

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.569 
of merging a great camera with a better
sense<00:03:37.170> or<00:03:37.290> better<00:03:37.530> processes<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.280> all<00:03:38.370> that

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
sense or better processes and all that

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.970 
sense or better processes and all that
stuff<00:03:38.700> yeah<00:03:39.450> you've<00:03:39.600> got<00:03:39.630> slightly<00:03:40.410> bitter<00:03:40.709> of

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
stuff yeah you've got slightly bitter of

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.059 
stuff yeah you've got slightly bitter of
frames<00:03:41.220> per<00:03:41.370> second<00:03:41.760> GA<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.239> something<00:03:42.510> more

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
frames per second GA but something more

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.250 
frames per second GA but something more
what<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.160> called<00:03:44.310> pixels<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.299> game<00:03:45.840> got<00:03:46.049> full

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
what it called pixels a game got full

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.430 
what it called pixels a game got full
frame<00:03:46.790> yeah<00:03:47.790> you've<00:03:48.269> got<00:03:48.299> slightly<00:03:48.900> better

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
frame yeah you've got slightly better

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.699 
frame yeah you've got slightly better

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
that cannons got the processing part of

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.530 
that cannons got the processing part of
your<00:04:02.069> process<00:04:02.370> log<00:04:02.790> information<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:03.450> it's

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
your process log information but it's

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.930 
your process log information but it's
not<00:04:03.720> really<00:04:03.959> doing<00:04:04.380> much<00:04:04.500> else<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.370> isn't

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940
