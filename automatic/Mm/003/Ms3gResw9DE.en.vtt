00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370 
superstar even though it's complete BS

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.029 
superstar even though it's complete BS
and<00:07:36.999> it's<00:07:37.539> impossible<00:07:38.080> to<00:07:38.139> win<00:07:38.289> and<00:07:38.830> whenever

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
and it's impossible to win and whenever

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.649 
and it's impossible to win and whenever
you<00:07:39.249> go<00:07:39.339> down<00:07:39.490> by<00:07:39.610> 10<00:07:39.819> points<00:07:39.999> it's<00:07:40.389> almost

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659 
you go down by 10 points it's almost

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:43.290 
you go down by 10 points it's almost
impossible<00:07:40.990> to<00:07:41.289> come<00:07:41.499> back<00:07:41.699> but<00:07:42.699> I'm<00:07:42.939> going<00:07:43.209> to

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:43.300 
impossible to come back but I'm going to

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.839 
impossible to come back but I'm going to
continue<00:07:44.020> playing<00:07:44.349> on<00:07:44.589> superstar<00:07:45.189> until<00:07:45.759> I

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:45.849 
continue playing on superstar until I

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:49.409 
continue playing on superstar until I
get<00:07:45.999> better<00:07:46.319> which<00:07:47.819> playing<00:07:48.819> as<00:07:48.969> a<00:07:48.999> shooting

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:49.419 
get better which playing as a shooting

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:52.889 
get better which playing as a shooting
guard<00:07:49.659> on<00:07:49.899> superstar<00:07:50.439> is<00:07:50.680> not<00:07:51.089> easy<00:07:52.089> because

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:52.899 
guard on superstar is not easy because

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.959 
guard on superstar is not easy because
you<00:07:53.289> can't<00:07:53.649> really<00:07:53.919> help<00:07:54.129> your<00:07:54.309> team<00:07:54.520> win<00:07:54.550> I

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:54.969 
you can't really help your team win I

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:57.240 
you can't really help your team win I
think<00:07:55.839> it's<00:07:55.930> you<00:07:56.050> k12<00:07:56.529> I'm<00:07:56.709> gonna<00:07:56.889> be<00:07:57.009> a<00:07:57.039> point

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250 
think it's you k12 I'm gonna be a point

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.490 
think it's you k12 I'm gonna be a point
guard<00:07:57.399> so<00:07:58.029> we<00:07:58.149> actually<00:07:58.329> have<00:07:58.689> a<00:07:58.719> chance<00:07:59.110> and

00:07:59.490 --> 00:07:59.500 
guard so we actually have a chance and

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.260 
guard so we actually have a chance and
maybe<00:07:59.860> I<00:07:59.979> can<00:08:00.219> bump<00:08:00.370> it<00:08:00.459> up<00:08:00.519> top

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.270 
maybe I can bump it up top

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.240 
maybe I can bump it up top
Hall<00:08:01.390> of<00:08:01.420> Fame<00:08:01.720> and<00:08:01.990> let's<00:08:02.620> hope<00:08:02.770> they<00:08:02.950> fix

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.250 
Hall of Fame and let's hope they fix

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.280 
Hall of Fame and let's hope they fix
this<00:08:03.520> next<00:08:03.900> 2k12

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.290 
this next 2k12

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.920 
this next 2k12
because<00:08:05.650> that's<00:08:05.860> just<00:08:06.070> not<00:08:07.000> even<00:08:07.270> fair<00:08:07.510> but<00:08:07.900> uh

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:07.930 
because that's just not even fair but uh
