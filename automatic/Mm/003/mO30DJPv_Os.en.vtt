00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.630
 hello everyone is going i hope that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.700
 you are fine 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.900
 today as promised I hold my 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.670
 promises and I 'll make you a little 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.109
 little kids play today so 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.890
 we will start with the smallest so 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.359
 it's the darts 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.470
 so it's starting from the beginning here so 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.199
 it is found one matter of replacement 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.369
 very good they so to play 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.939
 darts must go simply 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.289
 rats the bar so it's free it's 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.850
 the only game that's free after 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.410
 others are paying but I will 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 warn it's really not easy too 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.739
 to take in hand to play at the same time 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.820
 by the granny you will take you a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.280
 sheet metal and so that's go go on 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 starts in the eye you explain a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.100
 little bit how it works in the game 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.420
 darts for those who do not know 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.949
 of course because there you have the crown 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.949
 outside shines inside 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 but here is the next mile if you 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.300
 How did the name less at home 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.300
 rest 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.119
 after that you set up are the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.500
 choice you had just I 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.390
 wanted to make a three inning 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.220
 sleeves 6-1 Sunday in the game and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.400
 it's a party that also choose butt 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.690
 of game partners so I predict 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.800
 you to any parent etc you put them 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.270
 just start that shakes a 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.410
 little because nothing is mine 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.630
 not something that is 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.880
 easy to take in hand but after that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 will is not it begins to 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.520
 is I want you to lie in two 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.660
 minutes that's it you already master summer 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.610
 just to be careful 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.509
 do not put everything and anywhere it's 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.509
 the easiest game to take 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.190
 after he is playing it 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.960
 directly on the right targets do not 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.500
 do not know if you see she really 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.930
 want to win 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.149
 it does not leave you a second of 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.000
 respite so after am a lot of targets 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.650
 2000 - it's a little bit the goal I 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.420
 think of decreasing his score very 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:14.830
 quickly for now I lead but 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.700
 do you honestly there el 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.700
 hammami there is the stake 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.989
 we do not play and do not play with 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.100
 the middle circle she's playing who 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.040
 would dream she could sell look 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.010
 well the cheat go 20 again a wine 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:37.390
 in friends next to the maline 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.579
 you do not have much more 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.739
 mines and 73 did that for sure and 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.680
 sure the winners that should 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.299
 here you are 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.160
 perfect and grannies and toul have 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.340
 do a second part with the other 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.340
 opponent 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.609
 this time with her maid or 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.370
 sincere or his waitress I do not know 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:01.019
 here is so do not hesitate to tell me 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.269
 really what do you think that kind 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.310
 small days on gta 5 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.780
 if you like or if you do not like too much 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.239
 where do you really like it? 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.569
 or not too much do not hesitate to tell me that 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.889
 in the comments but also for 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.090
 those who have really made good 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.500
 scores also do not hesitate to say it 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.359
 without movement anymore you boast 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.260
 how does it work and it's for 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.280
 some who do not know 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.920
 necessarily a dartboard 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.599
 so after the debate must open on 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.530
 the comments are just indulgent 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.689
 about people who do not know 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.189
 necessarily the dartboard what we 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.359
 knew there are always people who are at 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.370
 above everyone so will 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.389
 go down a little on earth and get 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.159
 a little bit at everyone's level 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.060
 to give advice in fact this is 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.349
 not so complicated so if you mastered 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.840
 something will try to 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.700
 convey with wisdom we will say 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.930
 that instead of transmitting everything 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.510
 just show you're stronger 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.099
 it's useless it rhymes with nothing that was 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.299
 the strongest and after how we play 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.480
 yeah but I'm stronger wayne but 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.120
 after you see that's pretty restricted 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.889
 after like as speeches so there I 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.069
 really no sailing I am a 26 so 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.780
 I'm just touching the thing 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.190
 already moved a lot of advanced on it 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.799
 but it's still not easy to 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.549
 put that stuff so there I 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.549
 do a little 1 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.639
 so that's the limit 25 points that 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.079
 are missing from which I have tried to aim 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:22.259
 simply on the simply here 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:25.940
 well now on yoyo there are 21 points 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:33.180
 still applies a hi hi hi 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:34.800
 if they do not even have them 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.150
 offer me opponents during this time 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.150
 by the most but the girl 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.380
 at stability to the currents sometimes 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.460
 franklin he in shake must he 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.690
 stop drinking a little alcohol because 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.910
 that it makes him a little too much trouble 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.050
 hands how is it possible 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.700
 of flickering then there's nothing there like 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.470
 perfect them no stuff but that's it 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.820
 is she won so that's it 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.280
 not serious since it was inevitably 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.350
 just more finished discover than a super 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.520
 challenge that I proposed myself good 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.750
 I hope you liked it anyway so 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.070
 I repeat with his walls the friends for 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.090
 other small challenges on the map 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.090
 see you soon!
