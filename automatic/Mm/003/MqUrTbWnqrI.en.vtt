00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 because now play first time 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.620
 Oh, you shit 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.400
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.770
 other federal Mesch is'll have to 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.570
 Today I'm going to a match that 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.619
 means there are matches in this case 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.990
 you can get something like that 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.640
 The decision is not a chamber 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.960
 Primary players can only be three like out 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.760
 Can not you premium here can 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.340
 you make three a day and three a day 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.110
 as a premium player like on 24 million 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.630
 mark out of the million okay we are 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.310
 but not premium players because of that 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.080
 then we have to divide exactly and that 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.450
 like spielag manager, you can just as well 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.710
 then points comes point lose yes 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.360
 lose known points when you go to 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.130
 example is too much in it and under the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.100
 first two you get off the chamber 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.350
 Half always stop and you lose 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.700
 can talk you hear even have the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.500
 namely only prime games 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.880
 hello people yes then I want to say 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.020

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.030
 The same thing happens to me 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.530
 Yes, I know, it has to be low 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.060
 One of us loses world championship 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.860
 maybe that's the way it is 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.680
 maybe none of them are the same for the first time 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.170
 okay, okay 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.170
 12 it happened to me 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:27.799

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.219

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.960

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.850

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.950
 in the beautiful shot I'm okay 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.009
 Immediately inside 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.579
 and how is it looks cool from that 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.579
 here is, however 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.729
 ok i play now first time now 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.330
 Oh, you shit what I have here 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.369
 the drecks arena also kaka this with 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.600
 sms and that's exactly where water is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.759
 you can fall off so easily 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.610
 Capellmann I have no items and without 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.780
 item and without old cheap of death and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.480
 I think it was just a bit 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 when we are in arena 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.690
 the server later to fear because I'm on 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.820
 this on this game not so 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:27.000
 rehearsals ok i hate this arena the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.130
 itself was with us I have comics no 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.530
 ball on you nice or just because it sets 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.640
 was really violent I'm here 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.450
 directly two people just like that 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.910
 fell down 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.100
 the map is a goblet yes the monster me 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.019
 now wants to take the monster no 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.130
 I get grooms care 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.320
 i get help from life 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.630
 have fun we are happy again 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.829
 god command extras i know there is 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.410
 because it is only server and we 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.630
 are the rest in the game probably 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.730
 get out of my life 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.579
 get out of my often live here 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.470
 no, leave my life 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.989
 disappears from my ear from 6 46 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.970
 percent is done so more pleased what 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.530
 Do you really want me to be mine? 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.989
 create hate trying with the ama 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.180
 To create what for what was out after 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.410
 Come make the pharmacist my mother 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.070
 you're flying down smasher day i 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.600
 Go away all the euro away 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.799
 here 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.359
 Ok, that's why matches have been wrestling 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.709
 which I enjoy because it's something 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.720
 is there really more so larifari 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.400
 but this is really about what but 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.420
 I think I think I 'll be mine 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.340
 probably pick premium 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.660
 I do not have a premium so what 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.350
 think you write comments i should 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.640
 get with bremen 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.329
 are you for that, I should do that more often 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.320
 play the game in this rank like 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.459
 sees it with you from visible only times 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.420
 all times experience since she was and is 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.290
 always like a mushroom soup from which I train 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.000
 I am completely cured 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.300
 yes I am completely healed, I'm 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.390
 completely cured again no 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.970
 this resort or whatever the box 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.440
 back healed to stay ok 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.540
 Sword delivered for hold 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.820
 to get 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.830
 in the bow now comes the baba but why 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.340
 So I ask myself that with me 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.420
 2 1 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.700
 I am right I can not 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.260
 we say but I won 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.820
 I won the first man 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.930
 I did not cry anything I did 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.190
 I did not go anything I got 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.000
 I did not do anything but it is always there 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.000
 still it is finally distance 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.330
 visual recordings I've I've I 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.980
 I'm out I've won very well 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.980
 simon I also won first and 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:47.410
 some produced but since I have I 15 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.980
 I have now 1005 2015 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.660
 yes there it is because I have easy 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.890
 nothing is done i am i have too 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.090
 yet I think I might have one 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.980
 I do not even know if the ears got 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.140
 I've tried their entry into the 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.460
 has licked okay I 'll have a look 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.300
 where runs with the lex is that until the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.490
 fix it again 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.730
 I'll say a short round but it is 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.500
 also randomly one more here 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.120
 to hang around know that you just 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.620
 is wisdom to talk with the case again 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.120
 must be searched and so on me 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.280
 think so a short crisp is what 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.570
 nice but generally just write 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.840
 suggestions for improvement and criticism in 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.840
 the comments 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.690
 so if you say hey that was now 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.250
 five minutes or so that's one 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.510
 little too much prefer it 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.380
 at least two shots or power 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.730
 maybe not one after that 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.560
 rated round or something like that 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.780
 write his comments and write 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.400
 please, I should often this wrestle 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.840
 matches play where they are 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.980
 really about points is such a try 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.140
 yes, too many points too 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.890
 get help and is therefore peep 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.970
 times the people has 9 190 904 1984 now 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.270
 because the still more to come 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.050
 and I have 915 under 1150 only now 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.810
 sometimes a game from now more than 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:59.360
 Everything worth knowing Barro is aware of 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.320
 any case so this match has me 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.010
 must be properly made fun honestly 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.240
 say the rounds without rage I think 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.830
 now also as funny but i know 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.360
 I do not like it when it comes to something 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.009
 would be great to lose in both chambers 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.020
 win 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.020
 that made me really bock I think 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.689
 i also won i dont know who did 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.159
 still a live ok so it was wrong 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.960
 very good that also won perfect 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.149
 to the end harms if I the 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.639
 same arena have come is by chance 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:26.110
 that's just the thing yes if it's you 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.369
 I like the post and I like it 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.629
 have a waterfall people again 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.830
 or I just want to say 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:36.599
 See you next time again 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.599
 means to get 19
