00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.170
 at this step of the limit we are 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.630
 again from the hotel plaza colon in 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.850
 Granada to the city thanks to the map of 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.340
 nicaragua true and we are recording here 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.630
 or super special tutorial and now for 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.310
 change a little bit of style 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.570
 people that I imagine that all of you 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.320
 you have to ask to ask sometimes 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.150
 you want to vary 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.770
 always keeping your style the truth 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.000
 but you would like to lengthen or have to 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.400
 having cuts gives a little bit of fear 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 constant what it does is for that thousands 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.040
 the truth is that it is a hairstyle that always 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.470
 It gives you that functionality in your hair 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.970
 can wear the shorts but always going to 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.930
 Being long is super nice because 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.930
 no one 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 the majorities are not all so 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.070
 daring to cut call it start 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.110
 that the rest would not hide initial for 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 that they practice in their tutorial and this 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.970
 Friday we are going to do it in the background 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.480
 Actions 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 often doing most of the hair 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:15.040
 the waves have to make them 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.490
 tube clamp and lacerations 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.150
 because the relationship 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.150
 upwards 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.340
 yes 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.340
 on the top 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.630
 down because we're going to use the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.630
 parts 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.680
 a single division 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.680
 the Mint 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.790
 now that the division is already 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.940
 and then we will go picking up as if 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.300
 let's make anchovy 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.010
 this way we're going to take the wave 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.010
 and we're going to tangle the dumbbell 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 in the last part I will do 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.530
 holding the probe 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.600
 when always the bottom part 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.110
 how can you walk the freeze to 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.660
 that we leave you free 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.660
 to be seen as part of the job 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.800
 and later 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 they say we have 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.880
 various 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.580
 to go doing it 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.640
 I'm doing the same thing if you look 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.770
 always picking up the whole wave 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.510
 to make it look pretty short 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.400
 then the top always the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.700
 I leave because that is the one that I am going to 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.819
 use for later 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.060
 discover everything and I'm going to do 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.900
 the top of science for 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.900
 hide all the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.900
 work 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.939
 you 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.150
 and we have the final part we will 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.640
 the leaves 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.540
 that this 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.540
 these 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.140
 without hiding the other 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.569
 now let's slow down 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.120
 and also 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.299
 to cover them 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.150
 good readers of the blog we have arrived 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:29.630
 at the end of this step by step with the great 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.100
 miller and I feel different I can say 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.970
 that I can dare to cut my hair 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.970
 I like it 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.820
 but super interesting how to play 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.760
 with your hair combed I like it because 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.930
 you can have another facet of hair and 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.070
 always keep the long and I like it is 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.070
 super different 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.130
 Exactly what I do like that we 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.320
 we can dare to wear a day that I see 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.140
 short after long for whose goal 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.230
 special and loves is super fast what can 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.480
 do from home and as they always say 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.850
 our miller loves the truth that 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.460
 important is that it lasts on your hair 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.440
 we use the complete line of 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.840
 hydrocapital and zation and I always say 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.730
 that it's worth using the line 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.770
 complete because they will not see you better 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.140
 results in this case I always 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.690
 I recommend the ampoule at 10 minutes or 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.840
 if not this hydrocapital cream and 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.820
 also to repair the tips or 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.900
 be that if they do not have that one can 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.900
 be us 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:45.620
 all the steps of the line the 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:48.510
 adequate protection all the time 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.020
 graphics 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.020
 you can leave it 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.680
 because it also gives you the functionality 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.979
 d 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.979
 another step 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.120
 exposing our hair to heat 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.919
 well then we have come to the end 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.919
 thank you very much for joining us 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:23.730
 it's easier for them to do the step by step 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.730
 so that they try all 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.759
 It is so 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.360
 for us more be it 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.360
 important 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.190
 in an interaction 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.200
 Again, thank you very much, fashion 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.210
 would move forever to make me day and although 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.210
 the blas colom by the facilities
