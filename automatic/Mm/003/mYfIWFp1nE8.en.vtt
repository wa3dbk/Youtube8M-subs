00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
down through the holes maybe two or

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.039 
down through the holes maybe two or
three<00:04:16.010> times<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.609> secure<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.180> in<00:04:17.269> place<00:04:17.450> so

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
three times to secure it in place so
