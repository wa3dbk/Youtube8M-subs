00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280

doing this time around because she seems
to<00:00:19.020> be<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.859> hardest<00:00:20.220> hit<00:00:20.550> in

to be one of the the hardest hit in

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.470 
to be one of the the hardest hit in
terms<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.330> balance<00:00:22.289> changes<00:00:22.529> nerfs<00:00:23.390> if<00:00:24.390> you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
terms of balance changes nerfs if you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.570 
terms of balance changes nerfs if you
want<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.980> colloquial<00:00:25.980> about<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> let's<00:00:26.460> not

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
want to be colloquial about it let's not

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
want to be colloquial about it let's not
Lika<00:00:26.849> locally<00:00:27.180> i<00:00:27.210> suppose<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:27.949> anyway<00:00:30.560> yeah

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
Lika locally i suppose but anyway yeah

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
Lika locally i suppose but anyway yeah
so<00:00:31.740> let's<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.219> start<00:00:32.669> off<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:32.969> base

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
so let's just start off with the base

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.470 
so let's just start off with the base
stats<00:00:34.579> that's<00:00:35.579> been<00:00:35.790> changed<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.270> for

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
stats that's been changed a bit for

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.520 
stats that's been changed a bit for
ribbon<00:00:36.980> basically<00:00:37.980> her<00:00:38.420> hp5<00:00:39.420> base<00:00:39.960> stat<00:00:40.230> has

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
ribbon basically her hp5 base stat has

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
ribbon basically her hp5 base stat has
been<00:00:40.770> nerfed<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.160> used<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.520> 9.5<00:00:42.329> from<00:00:42.570> what

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
been nerfed it used to be 9.5 from what

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
been nerfed it used to be 9.5 from what
I've<00:00:42.809> been<00:00:42.840> reading<00:00:43.079> about<00:00:43.320> her<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.610> now

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I've been reading about her it is now

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
I've been reading about her it is now
four<00:00:45.120> point<00:00:45.420> five<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> says<00:00:45.809> five<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.649> but

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
four point five it says five here but

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.110 
four point five it says five here but
that's<00:00:46.950> probably<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.520> masteries<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that's probably because of masteries and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.439 
that's probably because of masteries and
whatever<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.629> they<00:00:49.110> base<00:00:49.440> Amen<00:00:50.309> php5<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.329> now

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
whatever but they base Amen php5 is now

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.470 
whatever but they base Amen php5 is now
four<00:00:51.840> point<00:00:52.140> five<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.789> basically<00:00:53.789> half

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
four point five so it's basically half

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.180 
four point five so it's basically half
what<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.870> used<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.270> pretty<00:00:57.539> big

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
what it used to be so that's pretty big

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.310 
what it used to be so that's pretty big
in<00:00:59.190> addition<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.329> alt<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.960> also

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
in addition to that for alt was also

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.380 
in addition to that for alt was also
nerf<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.859> mainly<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> lower<00:01:02.730> ranks<00:01:03.059> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
nerf it's mainly at the lower ranks that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.899 
nerf it's mainly at the lower ranks that
it<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:03.629> nerve<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.309> hundred<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it was nerve but now it's a hundred and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
it was nerve but now it's a hundred and
ten<00:01:06.240> seconds<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:07.049> first<00:01:07.290> rank<00:01:07.530> 85<00:01:08.100> seconds<00:01:08.580> at

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
ten seconds at first rank 85 seconds at

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.810 
ten seconds at first rank 85 seconds at
second<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> 50<00:01:09.510> seconds<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> third<00:01:10.409> rank

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
second and 50 seconds of a third rank

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.880 
second and 50 seconds of a third rank
this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.030> longer<00:01:12.960> than<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> used<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.770> be

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this is longer than it used to be

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
this is longer than it used to be
because<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.280> used<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.549> 75<00:01:14.939> seconds<00:01:15.570> 60

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
because it used to be 75 seconds 60

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.109 
because it used to be 75 seconds 60
seconds<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.380> 45<00:01:16.920> seconds<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:17.970> see

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
seconds and 45 seconds so as you can see

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.520 
seconds and 45 seconds so as you can see
the<00:01:18.240> max<00:01:18.450> rank<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.170> five

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the max rank it's only about five

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.780 
the max rank it's only about five
different<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> first<00:01:23.189> rank<00:01:23.520> that's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
different but at the first rank that's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.620 
different but at the first rank that's
quite<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.900> 30<00:01:26.000> it's<00:01:27.000> 35

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
quite a bit that's actually 30 it's 35

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
quite a bit that's actually 30 it's 35
seconds<00:01:28.490> longer<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> yeah<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
seconds longer so yeah that's that the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.789 
seconds longer so yeah that's that the
other<00:01:32.820> change<00:01:33.329> made<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> ribbons<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.439> e

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
other change made to ribbons that are e

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.120 
other change made to ribbons that are e
the<00:01:35.400> key<00:01:35.640> burst<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.650> actually<00:01:37.770> buffed

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the key burst that was actually buffed

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.440 
the key burst that was actually buffed
so<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.369> guess<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.060> had<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.270> buff

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so I guess you know they had to buff

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.700 
so I guess you know they had to buff
something<00:01:39.840> under<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.229> change<00:01:40.439> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
something under when they change and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.819 
something under when they change and
they<00:01:40.799> nerfed<00:01:41.040> all<00:01:41.130> those<00:01:41.280> other<00:01:41.460> things<00:01:41.549> but

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
they nerfed all those other things but

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
they nerfed all those other things but
yeah<00:01:43.829> basically<00:01:44.220> every<00:01:44.729> single<00:01:45.060> rank<00:01:45.210> it's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
yeah basically every single rank it's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.950 
yeah basically every single rank it's
now<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.500> grants<00:01:46.860> 10<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.430> HP<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> shield

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
now it grants 10 more HP to the shield

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.510 
now it grants 10 more HP to the shield
so<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.350> 70<00:01:49.770> 100<00:01:50.490> 130<00:01:50.970> 160<00:01:51.840> 190<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.710> opposed<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so it's 70 100 130 160 190 as opposed to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
so it's 70 100 130 160 190 as opposed to
what<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.820> before<00:01:53.970> which<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.390> 60<00:01:54.869> 90<00:01:55.110> 120

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
