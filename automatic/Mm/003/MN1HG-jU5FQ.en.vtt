 women in the history of the Olympic Games 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.820
 we never had a Brazilian swimmer in the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.039

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 where the José Finkel trophy was 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810

 amazonense the only age of cars in the area 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.329
 to say that this young woman is very young 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.579
 you have much to learn what she wants 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.379
 to be what I want at the moment this is the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.170

 Brazilian championship played in 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.009
 50 meter pool 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.289
 which she does not want any 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.600
 Brazil managed until today 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.149
 last played in the world in July 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.369

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.569
 room 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.200
 we never got so close to the podium in a 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.750
 high- level competition 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 Today I see that it is really close and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.079
 lack believes more in a question there 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 swimming pools because swimming 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.740
 Brazilian woman has never stepped on can not 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.899
 Olympic podium of a world 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.789
 the second at age 11 and does not know 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.740
 keep your shoulders broad but your mother 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.049
 Know then she'll tell you. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.549
 talking daughter is not like that why not 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.730
 It will look good so have some 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:18.000
 that this lock is aesthetic one 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.790
 reasons may be based on the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.459
 training is true but when the girl 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.660
 large shoulder orbit the back 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.299
 and there was a lack of reference 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.120
 idol olympic champion that interferes 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.400
 motivation and belief itself is 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.820
 of the athletes speak the following I also 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.820
 I can 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.610
 can in any sport means 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.220
 reference and reverence the idol may 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.800
 shorten paths for these boys by 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.640
 example looking ahead is looking at the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.470
 past 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.110
 among men, Brazil has a 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.140
 relay of champions and medalists 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.920

 results of brazilian women swimming 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.700

 in total Poliana brought three medals of 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.310
 barcelona silver and bronze and which has 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.820

 the world's oceans but is little they 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.370
 want more and draw attention to a 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.470
 important nowadays the swimming 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.870
 here in brazil she does not have much 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.430
 quantity and how much more the company 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.680
 while the more competitive 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.960
 but watch quality 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.270
 the concern is in the numbers of 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.760
 participants of the trophy josef finkel um 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.240

 There are 348 swimmers in total 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.790
 already in the national championship north 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.890
 American athletes were one thousand 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.200
 Poliana and Ana Marcela will become 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.900
 reference to female swimming and when 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.530
 the phase is good no matter what the taste of 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.740
 Water 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.560
 salty or sweet julienne dipped the gain 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.780
 of the 1500 meters free beyond the victory 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.190

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.919
 It lasted 12 years that the training today too 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.840
 more than many men men have to 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.630
 to train to train with me 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.599
 she started at the pool and went to the sea 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.510
 in 2006, influenced by her husband and 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.340
 also technician ricardo cintra the guarantor 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.610
 that she trains as much as men 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.870

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.960
 super female and the world champion husband 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:14.289

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:27.450
 Yes, but full of grace. 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.650
 Do you really think you're missing? 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.960
 femininity around here because there 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.910

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.910
 I'm going to like it. 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.979
 they will look even more beautiful with 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.349
 an Olympic medal in the chest 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:46.349
 It is or is not who did not let anything pass.
