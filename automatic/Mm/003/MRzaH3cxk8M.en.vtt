 get a ribbon I will be able to make peanut butter with my team 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.169
 You have a good chance it will be the match 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.889
 the rooster I speak from experience real easiest ratings has almost nothing 

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.109
 necessary for 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.439
 mdp and really anyone can do it and it also really takes five minutes too 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.930
 but the reason that is also video shows them with that petraeus tracy for that 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.400
 percent are quite there 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.510
 adopt different textures and if you are just busy bit open the first 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.850
 ride is after 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 by noticing 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.140
 tasty and healthy than peanut butter from a jar 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.260
 yes I know this very much to see and watch 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.400
 only the African make the eight two content 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.890
 endoscopes actually only pay later, but unfortunately it is only just out 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.410
 thin climate 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.410
 I have a case here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.900
 of course you also get just unpeeled peanuts 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.430
 he essentially ran you 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.740
 that did take effect against Turkish targets fine and sheep fifties to the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 retail tablet is then inland shipping 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.990
 really 6 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 in each of the four to five 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 m 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.410
 4 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 in September will first have to become a mother 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 another substitute besides 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
 the lessons 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.469
 Owners of senior citizens at work were just doing it 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.730
 then you see that the pentagon the signs have become just keep going 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.859
 the opening also gets the station street out of control 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.029
 it's really dr 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.019
 it goes with you can show 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 but the entire village 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.429
 the afternoon stays on the side of 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:21.429
 little 0 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.089
 the street hoped for fact because they were between forty 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.389
 among the detainees 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.299
 and I like it 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.529
 next step we are there 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.529
 Monday 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.180
 the fact that actually doesn't matter 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.999
 by later 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.999
 9 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.539
 really 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.960
 we are going to import 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.160
 after the chance is small
