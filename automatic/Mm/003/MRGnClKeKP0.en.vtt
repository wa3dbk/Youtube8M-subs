00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.889 
instead of the three a week that I have
been<00:01:50.159> doing<00:01:50.369> previously<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:51.869> give

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
been doing previously and that will give

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380
