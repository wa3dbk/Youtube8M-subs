00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.929 

the<00:00:01.110> basic<00:00:01.530> concept<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.159> wing<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.639> sprint

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
the basic concept of a wing and sprint

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.880 
the basic concept of a wing and sprint
car<00:00:03.090> racing<00:00:03.330> there<00:00:03.689> that<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.470> front<00:00:04.740> wing

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
car racing there that the front wing

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.460 
car racing there that the front wing
here<00:00:05.220> or<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.580> large<00:00:06.390> top<00:00:06.690> wing<00:00:06.870> up<00:00:06.990> above<00:00:07.230> is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
here or the large top wing up above is

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.500 
here or the large top wing up above is
to<00:00:07.589> create<00:00:07.859> downforce<00:00:08.069> by<00:00:08.610> slowing<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> air

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
to create downforce by slowing the air

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.259 
to create downforce by slowing the air
over<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.559> top<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.980> wing<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.370> increasing

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
over the top of the wing and increasing

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.419 
over the top of the wing and increasing
the<00:00:12.360> air<00:00:12.480> speed<00:00:12.750> underneath<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:14.130> let's<00:00:14.250> take<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the air speed underneath so let's take a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.860 
the air speed underneath so let's take a
close<00:00:14.730> look<00:00:14.849> at<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.150> front<00:00:15.389> wing<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
close look at the front wing here and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.630 
close look at the front wing here and
then<00:00:15.960> we'll<00:00:16.049> explain<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.680> does<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
then we'll explain what it does it's the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.939 
then we'll explain what it does it's the
way<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.210> front<00:00:18.810> wing<00:00:18.960> tries<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.590> slow

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
way that the front wing tries to slow

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650 
way that the front wing tries to slow
the<00:00:20.100> air<00:00:20.220> down<00:00:20.430> over<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> top<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.510> got<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the air down over the top it's got a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
the air down over the top it's got a
dish<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> slow<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> wing<00:00:22.710> down<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.130> this

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
dish here to slow the wing down and this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.700 
dish here to slow the wing down and this
is<00:00:24.240> called<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> either<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.900> gurney<00:00:25.140> flap<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.680> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
is called a either a gurney flap or a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
is called a either a gurney flap or a
wicked<00:00:26.010> bill<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.609> meant<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> slow<00:00:27.480> the

been extremely successful in racing the
wingless<00:01:22.799> midgets<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.430> Robbie<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.450> mean<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
wingless midgets so Robbie I mean the

wingless midgets so Robbie I mean the
wings<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.770> these<00:01:25.950> cars<00:01:26.189> obviously<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.670> makes<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
wings on these cars obviously it makes a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
wings on these cars obviously it makes a
fundamental<00:01:27.509> difference<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:28.170> terms<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
fundamental difference in terms of the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.649 
fundamental difference in terms of the
speed<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> corner<00:01:29.460> speed<00:01:29.729> piece<00:01:30.150> maybe<00:01:30.360> give

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
speed and corner speed piece maybe give

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.660 
speed and corner speed piece maybe give
our<00:01:30.960> viewers<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.799> an<00:01:31.860> explanation<00:01:32.130> in

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
our viewers a bit of an explanation in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
our viewers a bit of an explanation in
the<00:01:32.759> differences<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.840> car<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the differences and what this car is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
the differences and what this car is
like<00:01:34.650> we're<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> wing<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> think

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
like we're the wing and what you think

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
like we're the wing and what you think
it'd<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.270> without<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.720> there's<00:01:37.350> no

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
it'd be like without one there's no

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
it'd be like without one there's no
there's<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> huge<00:01:38.040> difference<00:01:38.100> between<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
there's not a huge difference between a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.050 
there's not a huge difference between a
speed<00:01:40.409> car<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> spring<00:01:41.040> car<00:01:41.250> predominately

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
speed car and a spring car predominately

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
speed car and a spring car predominately
the<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.479> size<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> horsepower<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the the size and the horsepower but the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.039 
the the size and the horsepower but the
basics<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> cars<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.240> same<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
basics of the cars are the same the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
basics of the cars are the same the
biggest<00:01:46.350> difference<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> wing<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.820> what

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
biggest difference is a wing and what

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.160 
biggest difference is a wing and what
that<00:01:48.149> does<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> handling<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> car

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that does with the handling of the car

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.800 
that does with the handling of the car
is<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> makes<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> big<00:01:50.280> difference

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
is it makes a big difference

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
is it makes a big difference
phenomenally<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.310> speaker<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
phenomenally with it with a speaker you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
phenomenally with it with a speaker you
need<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> go<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> corner<00:01:54.299> float<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
need to go in the corner float it in

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.929 
need to go in the corner float it in
without<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.979> downforce<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.759> need<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
without the downforce you really need a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
without the downforce you really need a
wash<00:01:57.119> off<00:01:57.299> speed<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.259> saw<00:01:58.920> being

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
wash off speed you know we saw being

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039 
wash off speed you know we saw being
sideways<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> spring

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
sideways and and there with the spring

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.480 
sideways and and there with the spring
cars<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> find<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:01.979> wings<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.280> so

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
cars there you find these wings are so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.470 
cars there you find these wings are so
so<00:02:03.360> efficient

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
so efficient

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.910 
so efficient
that<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.810> really<00:02:05.110> run<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.470> car<00:02:05.650> in<00:02:05.770> there

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
that you really run the car in there

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.560 
that you really run the car in there
straight<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.580> car<00:02:06.760> winds<00:02:06.970> down<00:02:07.180> on<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.390> left

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
straight the car winds down on the left

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.360 
straight the car winds down on the left
it<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:07.870> pulls<00:02:08.140> down<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.500> left<00:02:08.680> side<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.340> you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.370 
it just pulls down the left side and you

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.520 
it just pulls down the left side and you
adjust<00:02:09.910> your<00:02:10.000> setup<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.840> allow<00:02:10.870> for<00:02:11.350> that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
adjust your setup to allow for that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.010 
adjust your setup to allow for that
obviously<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:13.150> just<00:02:13.330> yeah<00:02:13.480> obviously<00:02:13.840> down

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
obviously and just yeah obviously down

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.840 
obviously and just yeah obviously down
force<00:02:14.260> equal<00:02:14.560> speed<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.070> spring<00:02:15.460> cars<00:02:15.670> that's

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
force equal speed and spring cars that's

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.700 
force equal speed and spring cars that's
why<00:02:15.940> they<00:02:16.060> are<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.300> fast<00:02:16.540> well<00:02:17.380> Robbie<00:02:17.560> you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
why they are so fast well Robbie you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.050 
why they are so fast well Robbie you
talked<00:02:17.920> about<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.220> difference<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> midget

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
talked about the difference in a midget

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.610 
talked about the difference in a midget
and<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.510> spring<00:02:19.750> car<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.260> without<00:02:20.350> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and a spring car with and without the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.100 
and a spring car with and without the
wing<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.310> we're<00:02:21.460> not<00:02:21.610> here<00:02:21.760> tonight

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
wing and we're not here tonight

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.570 
wing and we're not here tonight
qualifying<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.500> some<00:02:23.650> 12<00:02:23.920> second<00:02:24.250> lap<00:02:24.400> so

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
qualifying to see some 12 second lap so

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.220 
qualifying to see some 12 second lap so
I'm<00:02:24.640> guessing<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.270> little<00:02:25.420> better<00:02:25.720> if

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
I'm guessing if not a little better if

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.750 
I'm guessing if not a little better if
we<00:02:26.380> took<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.710> wing<00:02:26.860> off<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.160> race<00:02:27.400> car<00:02:27.610> and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
we took the wing off this race car and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.430 
we took the wing off this race car and
you<00:02:27.850> able<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.060> adjust<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.810> mean<00:02:29.020> how<00:02:29.260> much

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you able to adjust on it I mean how much

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.600 
you able to adjust on it I mean how much
is<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.740> gonna<00:02:29.890> make<00:02:29.980> if<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.310> take<00:02:30.490> your

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
is that gonna make if you take your

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.640 
is that gonna make if you take your
identical<00:02:31.090> race<00:02:31.240> car<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.600> 50<00:02:32.020> horsepower<00:02:32.320> what

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
identical race car a 50 horsepower what

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.110 
identical race car a 50 horsepower what
do<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:32.770> think<00:02:32.950> it'd<00:02:33.040> be<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.430> don't<00:02:33.730> meant<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.000> be

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
do you think it'd be I don't meant to be

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.520 
do you think it'd be I don't meant to be
somewhere<00:02:34.360> around<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.630> second<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> half<00:02:35.110> two

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
somewhere around a second and a half two

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.470 
somewhere around a second and a half two
seconds<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> lap<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.970> know<00:02:37.090> when<00:02:37.240> you're<00:02:37.360> only

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
seconds a lap you know when you're only

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.570 
seconds a lap you know when you're only
doing<00:02:37.810> 12<00:02:38.110> or<00:02:38.290> 11<00:02:38.470> years<00:02:38.710> sub<00:02:38.950> 11<00:02:39.190> second<00:02:39.400> laps

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
doing 12 or 11 years sub 11 second laps

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.430 
doing 12 or 11 years sub 11 second laps
that's<00:02:39.820> that's<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.120> fair<00:02:40.330> fair<00:02:40.690> bet<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.020> would

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
that's that's a fair fair bet it would

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.730 
that's that's a fair fair bet it would
take<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.680> minimum<00:02:42.190> 10%<00:02:42.760> away<00:02:43.410> from<00:02:44.410> from<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
take a minimum 10% away from from the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.470 
take a minimum 10% away from from the
car's<00:02:44.980> performance<00:02:45.190> as<00:02:45.910> far<00:02:46.120> as<00:02:46.210> speed<00:02:46.420> goes

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
car's performance as far as speed goes

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.300 
car's performance as far as speed goes
so<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> big<00:02:47.680> difference<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.130> then

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
so it is a big difference and then

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.500 
so it is a big difference and then
you've<00:02:48.460> got<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.700> adjustment<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.240> there<00:02:49.360> in

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
you've got the adjustment in there in

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.210 
you've got the adjustment in there in
the<00:02:49.630> cockpit<00:02:49.960> on<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.140> race<00:02:50.260> car<00:02:50.500> which<00:02:50.650> which

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the cockpit on the race car which which

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.800 
the cockpit on the race car which which
during<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.670> race<00:02:51.850> has<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> track<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> terrier

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
during a race has a track the terrier

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.240 
during a race has a track the terrier
eight<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.080> drives<00:02:53.290> out<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.800> track<00:02:54.010> slows

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
eight and drives out and the track slows

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.680 
eight and drives out and the track slows
down<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.030> you're<00:02:55.270> looking<00:02:55.510> for<00:02:55.660> more

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
down and you're looking for more

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.720 
down and you're looking for more
rear-wheel<00:02:56.200> drive<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.710> can<00:02:56.860> adjust<00:02:57.190> on<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
rear-wheel drive you can adjust on the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.940 
rear-wheel drive you can adjust on the
hydraulics<00:02:58.210> of<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.570> car<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.200> move<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.830> wing

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
hydraulics of the car to move the wing

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.230 
hydraulics of the car to move the wing
back<00:03:00.130> which<00:03:00.430> are<00:03:00.580> then<00:03:00.700> playing<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.060> car

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
back which are then playing the car

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.940 
back which are then playing the car
harder<00:03:01.570> on<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.320> rear<00:03:02.470> wheels<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:02.830> the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
harder on the on the rear wheels as the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.830 
harder on the on the rear wheels as the
race<00:03:03.130> goes<00:03:03.160> on<00:03:03.490> so<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.880> something<00:03:04.120> that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
race goes on so it is something that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.060 
race goes on so it is something that
makes<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.110> big<00:03:05.260> difference<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.620> car<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:06.010> it

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
makes a big difference to the car but it

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.260 
makes a big difference to the car but it
can<00:03:06.190> also<00:03:06.340> make<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> big<00:03:06.700> difference<00:03:06.910> car

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
can also make a big difference car

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.780 
can also make a big difference car
during<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.630> race
