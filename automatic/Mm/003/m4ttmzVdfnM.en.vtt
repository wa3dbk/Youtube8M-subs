00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.199
 m 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.579
 Why 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.979
 it helps all those and all those 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.350
 my very first conference on the wii 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.349
 sokolov from lebanon ans 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.440
 these first 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.960
 so please do not be the bad guy in the comments 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 not sure frankly it's by opa say that these hard 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460
 but that's really weird to talk like 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.020
 Sherpa to commit someone weird 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.840
 in front of his computer all this I tell you 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 we feel a little bit 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.060
 so I may play general in time as you may have noticed 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.530
 so I'm biting fake bus from there I'm no longer modest 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 this is going to be very fast to see them go 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.800
 so to put the country in chaos 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.060
 like that of many others I think 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.730
 it's too early to portici 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.910
 and 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.300
 and percent 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.940
 like that you make filmic device * 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.940
 they wanted to kill those concerned were killed press 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.130
 so here I wanted but already m 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.420
 it went very fast 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.000
 ten minutes after ten minutes of play 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 I'm going to start mid-dog 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.650
 now 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.950
 and from here the party will really go 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.450
 very quickly 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.760
 you'll see 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.240
 there I come back 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.800
 second snag in the voice 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.130
 michel lafon wanna do a job really unbelievable 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.210
 We can say it like that 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.450
 surprise me but general motors 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.170
 the dogs what to do 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.619
 but it was during the period duke tho 24 sept so we were all in the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.470
 part 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 and also doubts and that's why you see too many points 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.720
 it's normal 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.670
 so here I do not forget 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.220
 justice 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.649
 they have received a lot of messages now 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.049
 there it'll be the last dogs 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.769

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.470
