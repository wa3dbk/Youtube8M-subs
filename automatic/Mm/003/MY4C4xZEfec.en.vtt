should be open up in the next few days

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 
should be open up in the next few days
after<00:00:54.330> they<00:00:54.420> put<00:00:54.600> everything<00:00:54.780> away<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.080> get

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
after they put everything away and get

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.369 
after they put everything away and get
back<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> normal<00:00:56.130> operating<00:00:57.230> practices<00:00:58.230> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
back to normal operating practices I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.400 
back to normal operating practices I
guess<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.460> suspected<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.150> New<00:01:01.110> Orleans

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
guess as I suspected the New Orleans

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.750 
guess as I suspected the New Orleans
square<00:01:01.620> Christmas<00:01:02.040> decorations<00:01:02.610> are<00:01:02.700> up

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
square Christmas decorations are up

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.189 
square Christmas decorations are up
already<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.360> usually<00:01:03.540> always<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:04.050> these

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
already they usually always do these

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.920 
already they usually always do these
first<00:01:04.410> I<00:01:05.240> think<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.300> do<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.690> they

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
first I think they do that because they

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.180 
first I think they do that because they
blend<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.259> so<00:01:07.440> well<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> land<00:01:07.950> almost

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
blend in so well with the land almost

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.380 
blend in so well with the land almost
looks<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.910> way<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.090> should<00:01:09.270> look

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
looks like this the way it should look

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
looks like this the way it should look
normally<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.259> of<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.530> Mardi<00:01:11.040> Gras

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
normally because of the Mardi Gras

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460 
normally because of the Mardi Gras
decorations<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.320> look

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
decorations they you know they look

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.190 
decorations they you know they look
similar<00:01:14.150> like<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.330> guys<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:15.990> usually

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
similar like these guys are here usually

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.230 
similar like these guys are here usually
all<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> think

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.300 

last<00:01:25.810> year<00:01:26.049> they<00:01:26.170> had<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.320> bet<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:26.650> big<00:01:26.890> leaf<00:01:27.070> with

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
last year they had a bet a big leaf with

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.410 
last year they had a bet a big leaf with
a<00:01:27.360> Damascus<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.960> guy<00:01:29.140> sitting<00:01:29.500> in<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.130> reef

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a Damascus and a guy sitting in the reef

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.870 
a Damascus and a guy sitting in the reef

Christmas

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.850 
Christmas
and<00:01:54.730> my<00:01:55.060> suggestion<00:01:55.600> was<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.990> not<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:56.740> much

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
and my suggestion was that not so much

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.260 
and my suggestion was that not so much
it's<00:01:57.100> gonna<00:01:57.220> be<00:01:57.340> busy<00:01:57.520> pretty<00:01:57.820> much<00:01:57.970> always

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
it's gonna be busy pretty much always

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.730 
it's gonna be busy pretty much always
until<00:01:58.570> January<00:01:59.050> and<00:02:01.080> Wow<00:02:02.110> Adventureland<00:02:02.620> is

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
until January and Wow Adventureland is

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.920 
until January and Wow Adventureland is
probably<00:02:03.010> not<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.190> best<00:02:03.220> place<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.150> gauge

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
probably not the best place to gauge

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.480 
probably not the best place to gauge
that<00:02:05.290> because<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:05.710> usually<00:02:05.950> always<00:02:06.100> crowded

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
that because it's usually always crowded

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.930 
that because it's usually always crowded
here<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:07.150> is<00:02:07.300> still<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:07.810> crowded<00:02:08.110> as<00:02:08.259> usual

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
here it is still as crowded as usual
