like giant food fall from the sky and
the<00:01:35.300> way<00:01:35.480> food<00:01:35.870> is<00:01:36.020> used<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:36.920> really<00:01:37.610> creative

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
the way food is used is really creative

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.290 
the way food is used is really creative
like<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.200> bar<00:01:39.440> is<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:39.890> high<00:01:40.160> for<00:01:41.060> the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
like and the bar is so high for the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.270 
like and the bar is so high for the
creativity<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.170> not<00:01:42.320> from<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.620> first<00:01:42.860> movie

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
creativity and not from the first movie

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.670 
creativity and not from the first movie
blue<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:43.730> loved<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.570> loved<00:01:45.050> watching<00:01:45.260> him

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
blue I loved it I loved watching him

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.950 
blue I loved it I loved watching him
make<00:01:45.710> like<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> like<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.520> jello<00:01:46.910> house<00:01:47.270> for<00:01:47.690> Sam
