00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.040
 greetings guys, hear, I saw very well 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.049
 we have the cc is 3 to 1 or also 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.090
 known as the scorpion and for 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.480
 course that does justice his name 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.210
 is weapon is of the engineer class is 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.789
 a very intimidating weapon like it's not going to be 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.369
 intimidating to have good totes has 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.099
 you do not see an arthropod and you want 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.750
 take a run 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.090
 it is once more being hated 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.190
 call though I've seen more attitudes to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.920
 favor that against but let's analyze a 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.409
 little of why this happens very well 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.339
 we have 30 bullets in the charger and one in 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.620
 the bedroom 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.110
 only in total 31 bullets that provide 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.600
 an enemy nasal tube that you will have 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.449
 opposite and the reasons that a 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.489
 brutal cadence of a thousand bullets per minute 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.930
 Of course it will be a brutal amount of 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.030
 pain that it will provide to your 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.610
 enemies and although it has the mode of 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.970
 burst is the burst mode will not increase 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.739
 the cadence as it happens with other weapons 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.380
 very well here begins to put 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.530
 interesting let's remember something is 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.230
 classified as a p of wo a weapon 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.570
 of personal defense what already 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.030
 says that the range of the weapon is something 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.240
 maximum limit we can ask for medians 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.870
 distances and it's true the maximum damage is 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.660
 from 25 points to 8 meters and 12.1 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.150
 up to 55 meters if you realize it is 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.740
 lower than that of the assault weapons 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.510
 who is telling you that enemies to 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.270
 medium distances you'll have to 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.940
 avoid for three reasons number one the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.250
 damage is less number two the cadence is 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.160
 very high and number three the dispersion is 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.590
 pretty big everywhere we go 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.200
 is a bullet hose that spit at 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.060
 everywhere but not everything is so bad 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.250
 because precisely that cadence is 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.860
 controls in micro bursts because 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.410
 remember this is how these are controlled 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.180
 great cadences and you have to 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.310
 control them because those bullets are going 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.100
 very fast although the recharge time 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.280
 it's not so bad they're 2.4 seconds when 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.870
 is completely empty and 1.9 seconds 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.000
 when you have a bullet in the charger 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.950
 because it means that it's just a matter 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 of sheltering slightly to 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.580
 continue on the battlefield 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.650
 and we have that data so we already know 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.019
 that can only be used in areas 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.670
 small or very closed spaces here the 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.950
 only option that leaves us is obviously 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.750
 link this is just to help us 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.910
 those unpredictable moments that we have 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.980
 when we are cleaning areas and that the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.709
 enemy could surprise us with a 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.930
 fast attack but a problem that you 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.040
 facing is the same cadence that goes 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.050
 against you 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.030
 ok we had talked about micro bursts 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.610
 but the detail is in that this weapon 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.769
 has an excellent extra mode that is the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.080
 burst mode and this is when we 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.410
 we realized as much chicken as I did 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.299
 two ways to use this weapon is not the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.730
 all true that this weapon does not serve to 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.860
 beyond medium distances the mode 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.390
 of burst will extend a bit that 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.519
 distance there is a kind of 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.060
 contradiction that we have here for you 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.980
 using the heavy cannon if the cannon 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.230
 heavy could not be a very good idea 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 because we already know that it increases a lot 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.329
 recoil and putting in a weapon that 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.549
 apparently uncontrollable does not sound 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.290
 nothing good but the positive side is that 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.080
 will reduce a bit the dispersion of 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.630
 bullets and will make them more focused but 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.790
 to modify the uncontrollable behavior of 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.400
 your weapon will have to add a handle 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.730
 angle so that that kick is more 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.220
 controllable so shoot with burst 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.500
 and these accessories could extend very 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.050
 well the scope of the weapon even though 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.060
 has a brutal cadence try it but 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.880
 you know how long the weapon so 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.190
 rest between burst and burst so that 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.920
 do not get stuck when you click fast on the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.810
 buttons but another way in given case 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.930
 that the burst mode is not for you 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.120
 you can try in automatic mode but 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.800
 with two different accessories what is 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.020
 the mouth brake that is not so thick 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.420
 obviously here you will have to do micro 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.800
 bursts so that the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.440
 Mouth brake will prevent the recoil 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.880
 raise your weapon a lot and the handle hardness will 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.860
 that your bullets do not get so much 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.560
 dispersion by the use of the same brake and 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.190
 by the natural dispersion of the weapon as well 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.080
 what do you already know 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.030
 this weapon is a pretty aggressive weapon 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.220
 that allows to deliver a power of 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.650
 incredible fire towards your enemies in 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.810
 short students study distances if 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.060
 you use in burst and cannon mode 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.560
 heavy is the doing will serve you for 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.330
 unpredictable situations 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.820
 and in general truth that when controlling 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.520
 properly the trigger will have a weapon 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.590
 that will be the nightmare of your enemy and 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.880
 how it will not be 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.130
 imagine yourself a tremendous animal or going 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.530
 towards you so let me your experience 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.000
 in the comments or also comments to 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.919
 me if you are using it with others 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.870
 different accessories and how it has gone 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.520
 on the battlefield you already know that 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.500
 we have facebook social networks and 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.990
 twitter subscribe to the channel if they are not 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.220
 subscribed guys I'm the one I saw and I said goodbye 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.220
 with a big kiss 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.940
 Y 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.819
 ah 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.699
 so is 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.660
 and because 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.390
 yes
