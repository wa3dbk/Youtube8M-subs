00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.670
 we knew it was a match very 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.190
 important to us as the 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.000
 zaragoza is a direct rival to enter 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.110
 in those positions above so good 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.080
 we have to continue working as 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.779
 we had a good run and 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.399
 if a little frustrated because Zaragoza does not 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.710
 He did more than us to take the 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.619
 three points but it is true that 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.050
 They took advantage of that ruling that we had 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.489
 behind 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 they take the three points I think there are 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.550
 to go match to match and I do not know how or 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 if they are far away but good if we win 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.329
 as we usually did or 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.190
 not losing the three points and always 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.260
 scoring I think that after all 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.850
 we can approach but you have to go little 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.339
 little and the important thing now is the day 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.280
 booster I think you do not have to see that 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.190
 play one or the other or even the same 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.240
 luck but I think the whole group 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.320
 wants to go in the same direction and both 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.310
 the internationals like the homegrown 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310
 we are doing it well 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.740
 a little bit to say the key because I have not 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.690
 seen the game repeated and me 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.820
 example I like to see it but 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.920
 we did not put the one we had as well as 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.700
 barcelona or not the one that had got it 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.130
 yesterday the head shape luck not 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.440
 came in and then they took advantage of that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.450
 error but 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.150
 I do not know especially in what we fail but 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.620
 the field for us was not 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.100
 well because we are a team that likes 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.750
 play it and it 's a tad hard and in some 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 side there was ice and we had to go from 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 tiptoe but good we have to think 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.720
 already in the next match the position 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.500
 I put a lot of session behind the front 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.420
 Y 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 why 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.880
 two midcentres of Zaragoza would be 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.130
 a lot with eco and merino 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.840
 and I'm comfortable behind them I received 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.789
 well the ball and opened bands well but 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.610
 when they expelled nico I had to 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.950
 back and throw me and the team went 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.319
 forward then still 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.330
 more backwards because nicola raised a 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.190
 little to comb balls and such but 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.680
 well my average position tip I'm very 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.209
 comfortable good I look good lowered 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.209
 when I do not play with the promises and 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.080
 then enter as a substitute in the back more 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.940
 cold internal reservation tickets but 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.270
 a little colder but good I think that 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.410
 physically I'm fine although if 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.630
 processes at the end the pace of 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.390
 competition is noticeable but I think 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.800
 that is physically well 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.800
 There were no casualties either among 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.650
 I have to wait, I think I'm 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.780
 working well yesterday the minutes that 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.300
 I had looked good 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.459
 I had a good feeling and I have to be 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.800
 well this line does not way either what 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.240
 happens is that when I go down with the process 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.400
 many times it's my turn just to play 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.440
 I train with them and yes I know the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.930
 people but you go in a bit like you do not 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.640
 You know very comfortable the coach wants 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.430
 but when he came down mate or he explains me well 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.650
 He speaks very well with me and I understand very 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.410
 well with him then he makes me more 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.340
 easy I think it's vital we have to 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.580
 win yes or yes 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.170
 we're worth even a draw 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.270
 and we will go out and win as we do 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.260
 all weekend but this party I 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.209
 I think it's more important 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 and to keep hooking us there 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.680
 up and by the team's encouragement to 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.870
 get confidence and so that the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.120
 points here at home well I think so 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.709
 because long king gives us a lot of life 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.950
 especially the first part that is 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.049
 when we tighten the most and such and that 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.030
 above is right is where we attack that 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.920
 part so good you have to respect your 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.989
 decision not to enter the first 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.700
 part and hopefully this weekend 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.159
 in trento the party so that we have 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.659
 that breath there in the stands throughout 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.489
 the party and I think indar spari 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.790
 for us it is very important given that 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.549
 they always encourage us to lose 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.519
 let's go bad image have come to many 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.859
 sites to cheer us away I remember 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.159
 ainia ghosts was in albacete that came 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.409
 many people encourage them and after 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.780
 the games that were given then that 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.639
 we should also support them 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.090
 but you have to respect the 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.090
 decisions
