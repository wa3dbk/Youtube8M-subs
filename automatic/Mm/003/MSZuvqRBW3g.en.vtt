00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.049
 good evening everyone we are in autumn 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.400
 it's for the calendar but on the sky 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.799
 today we had a new 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.679
 little summer air with temperatures 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.030
 summer we were 7 to 8 degrees at 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.830
 above seasonal averages including 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.929
 in the southwest where we reached 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.119
 in the Atlantic Pyrenees the 33 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.109
 degrees and the heat will persist again 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.689
 for those next days 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.460
 always with this south south sector flow 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.109
 is that so back on the country we 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
 currently have on the near 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.830
 atlantic a depression system a 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 other in the direction of Russia we 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.009
 are between the two so of 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.320
 quite favorable conditions all the same 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 on the country even though the sky is 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 largely rates on a large half 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.690
 north of the country tomorrow morning some benches 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.980
 of fog that you find 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.210
 basically near the coast 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 also some maritime entries 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.700
 around the Mediterranean but in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.219
 the afternoon 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.469
 it's going to fall apart little by little 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.190
 will have a slight chance of showers 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.750
 essentially on the reliefs of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.520
 pyrenees is still a lot more than 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.350
 clouds around the lion's gulf 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 temperatures in the morning they go 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.730
 go down to 12 degrees for example 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 at aurillac 18 already in perpignan nice or 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.949
 still on the Basque country and in 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.320
 the afternoon 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.070

 minimal it will do again very 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.759
 beautiful very hot for the day of 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 Friday we will find some cirrus 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.840
 basically on the west of the country 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.729
 still a cloudy sky around the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 lion's gulf an average of 26 degrees 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.110
 on the northern half 29 in the south and at 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.150
 from Saturday before the arrival of a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.159
 new disturbance by the west of the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.869
 country with a cloudy sky 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 locally stormy showers and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.200
 before the sky will become more and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.180
 more veiled we will also find 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.829
 some waves around the lion's gulf 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 small drop in temperatures 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.939
 for the day of Sunday with the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 disturbance that will shift towards the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.630
 south east of the country going back to the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.070
 Burgundy with a few showers 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.659
 some showers that you will find 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.500
 also in the northwest with 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.110
 sunny spells 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.790
 so for Monday this cloudy sky you the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.750
 will essentially find 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.460
 eastern borders 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.250
 in the back a very little skyline 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 active the sun that will dominate around 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.719
 the Mediterranean with mistral and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.780
 tramontane Tuesday the improvement is 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.610
 confirmed by the south of the country 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.800
 sky still well charged in the northeast 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 and the temperatures always above 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.370
 season averages and Wednesday and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.990
 Well, we're going to a beautiful 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.140
 improvement over the country with a 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.150
 average of 22 degrees on the northern half 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.620
 26 degrees in the south of the country 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.090
 currently and well with these 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.430
 very high temperatures the lack of 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.930
 wind we have this pollution to 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.700
 fine particles which concerns a large 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.440
 northern half of the country as well as the island of 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.640
 France is one of the most important 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.069
 emitters of pollutants this 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.230
 the auto cash investigations comes back 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.300
 on pollution standards more and 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.670
 stricter just after two episodes 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.630
 of your series is the excellent source 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.630
