 I did not say yes he is absolutely without an accent 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.320

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.540

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.760
 late 60s early 70s 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.120
 It was 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.120

 experience is somewhat good there everything 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:16.450
 wonderful and is it possible 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.849
 a four year old and on topic such a thing 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.010
 said the apartment is likely there everything 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.650

 I suspect that English is without an accent 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.730
 he saved just because parents are 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.739

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.720
 Native Carry to Trade Soviet Man 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:08.170

 1 1 0 and the whole story can even be himself 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.070
 I don’t even remember the story 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.590
 I told only god is not that 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.180
 moment found just under the external goosebumps 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.510
 shoved on the back because it was alone 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.449
 from my first works and were still fresh 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.669
 remembers 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:07.669
 general disorder, I understand that you are the 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:09.919

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.539
 the same is happening with us now 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.779
 the very process of adaptation 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.779
 return to the roots of much more 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.569
 many will tell you and maybe he 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.969
 never got a higher education 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.189
 maybe this country of his advice 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.749
 here so he can be stamped him so 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:33.169
 many gave there to parents who did not 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:39.529
 suffered an apartment there is such a noise moscow 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:42.439
 I don’t know if I could 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.479
 tell only about my feelings on that 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:47.180
 at a particular point in time which is me 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.860
 It became a joke from the fact that a person lived 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.839
 not your life and some other 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.310
 maybe its it started on 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.620
 drugs here and 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:01.190
 pillars and hippies and nothing of it 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:03.470
 it turned out that maybe it works and man 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.810
 just arrived here that very 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.070
 born you know me for example 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.770
 I remember a joke 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.530
 known as we are of the late sixties when 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.810
 here began emigration to israel 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.760
 allowed and there was nobody that go two 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.190
 ship in the mediterranean sea 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.820
 one to Israel is floating and the other is from 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.770
 israel and people poured mean on deck 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.310
 and look at each other 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.140
 it means from one side of another 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.970
 twists believe finger at his temple Hmong there 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.340
 all those crazy that leave these 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.350
 listen to come here that is it turns out 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.750
 what would you be terrified 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.300
 you are a fresh American immigrant in horror 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.370
 from the fact that here it is 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.349
 passes the same process as drunk for 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:50.990
 account what parents communism do. 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:52.879
 if also twisted my finger and save 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.949
 I found I suspect that parents 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:58.699
 the communists only regretted 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:59.180
 and what they did and this is in front of me 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.680
 the scene 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.750
 not just like that if he was just 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.270
 Soviet school was nothing like that 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.340
 in my head there was no but parents before him 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.650
 to bring I think and now he is already on 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.080
 just not near could not break color i 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.110
 you cuddle that they got off easy 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.199
 if they didn't come in 50-60 and 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.219
 and 20 years earlier, they seem to be all 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.050
 rotted in the gulag 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:23.090
 and he would not have grown with his mom and dad 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.469

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.280
 best case in an orphanage for 

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:32.060
 parents for the children of the enemies of the people are all so 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.219
 and there are in Slavic how it is ours 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.819
 temirkanov and those the world knew only in 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:40.340
 the fact that a man at the behest of his parents 

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:41.670
 the past is not the life it has been 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:46.220
 intended 

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:47.460
 but first he has to postpone some 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.980
