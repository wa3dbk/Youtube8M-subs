00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
this is a third-person view of the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.640 
this is a third-person view of the
knock-back<00:00:25.890> glitch<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.380> normally<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.500> would

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
knock-back glitch and normally you would

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.179 
knock-back glitch and normally you would
not<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.429> high<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.040> he's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
not get this high so as you can see he's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.520 
not get this high so as you can see he's
really<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.910> high<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:35.149> he's<00:00:36.200> falling<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
really really high and he's falling and

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.100 
really really high and he's falling and
he's<00:00:37.829> out<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> map<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.790> he's<00:00:39.719> running

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
he's out of the map so he's running

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.470 
he's out of the map so he's running
around<00:00:40.200> now<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.000> normally<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> wouldn't<00:00:42.239> get

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
around now and normally you wouldn't get

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.170 
around now and normally you wouldn't get
this<00:00:42.660> high<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.520> there<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> technique

the<00:01:12.570> air<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:14.299> this<00:01:15.299> will<00:01:15.540> mean<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.460> all<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the air and this will mean that all the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
the air and this will mean that all the

guys will be shooting you but you'll

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.490 
guys will be shooting you but you'll
still<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.720> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> middle<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> air

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
still be like in the middle of the air

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
still be like in the middle of the air
but<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.729> won't<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but like you won't be going up if you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.090 
but like you won't be going up if you
know<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.020> mean<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
know what I mean because you have the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.580 
know what I mean because you have the
like<00:01:26.250> switch<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:29.840> it's<00:01:30.840> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
like switch on so it's kind of like the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
like switch on so it's kind of like the
freeze<00:01:31.890> jump<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.369> cod4<00:01:32.610> because<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
freeze jump from cod4 because the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.600 
freeze jump from cod4 because the
friction<00:01:34.229> from<00:01:34.380> card<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.159> where<00:01:35.400> your

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
friction from card for is where your

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.200 
friction from card for is where your
body<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> air<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:38.240> yeah<00:01:39.240> so

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
body was in the air and yeah so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.859 
body was in the air and yeah so
basically<00:01:43.430> your<00:01:44.430> body's<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:44.970> air<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.570> you

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
basically your body's in the air and you

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.800 
basically your body's in the air and you
get<00:01:46.049> shot<00:01:46.380> by<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> m<00:01:47.220> 60<00:01:47.729> s<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.600> just

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
get shot by all the m 60 s and that just

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.710 
get shot by all the m 60 s and that just
means<00:01:48.930> when<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.470> come<00:01:49.799> back<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.460> like

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
means when you come back from the like

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.069 
means when you come back from the like
you<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.799> air<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.600> go<00:01:54.600> back<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
you will be in the air so go back to the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
you will be in the air so go back to the
side<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> video<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> didn't<00:01:56.640> know

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to show you the ps3 method so this is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.980 
to show you the ps3 method so this is
what<00:02:06.240> you'll<00:02:06.450> need<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.930> ps3<00:02:07.229> method<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
what you'll need for the ps3 method and
