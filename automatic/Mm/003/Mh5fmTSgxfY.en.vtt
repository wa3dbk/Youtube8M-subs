00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
drives the graphics hardware and again

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.040 
drives the graphics hardware and again
this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.650> an<00:01:01.739> unmodified<00:01:02.309> game<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:03.570> off<00:01:03.600> the

face the field of view and the sensation
of<00:05:35.009> speed<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.639> get<00:05:35.819> is<00:05:36.029> just<00:05:36.509> incredible

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
of speed that you get is just incredible

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.629 
of speed that you get is just incredible
it's<00:05:37.529> not<00:05:37.710> unlike<00:05:37.919> if<00:05:38.069> I<00:05:38.129> turned<00:05:38.370> around<00:05:38.460> and

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
it's not unlike if I turned around and

it's not unlike if I turned around and
was<00:05:38.789> driving<00:05:38.999> this<00:05:39.210> monitor<00:05:39.539> with<00:05:39.659> my<00:05:39.779> hands

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
was driving this monitor with my hands

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.309 
was driving this monitor with my hands
except<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.849> couldn't<00:05:42.210> close<00:05:42.509> up<00:05:42.659> that<00:05:42.689> up<00:05:42.990> but

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319

hold it into his hands and use the

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.899 
hold it into his hands and use the
accelerometer<00:05:46.919> to<00:05:46.949> steer<00:05:47.279> our<00:05:47.430> car<00:05:47.669> like<00:05:47.879> a

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
accelerometer to steer our car like a

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.290 
accelerometer to steer our car like a
steering<00:05:48.300> wheel<00:05:48.539> it's<00:05:48.900> really<00:05:49.169> cool<00:05:50.300> it's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
steering wheel it's really cool it's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.989 
steering wheel it's really cool it's
also<00:05:51.599> fully<00:05:52.259> touch<00:05:52.590> enabled<00:05:52.889> and<00:05:53.430> we<00:05:53.879> had<00:05:53.969> a

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:53.999 
also fully touch enabled and we had a

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.459 
also fully touch enabled and we had a
lot<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.300> fun<00:05:54.419> experimenting<00:05:54.810> with<00:05:55.169> different

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
lot of fun experimenting with different

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.589 
lot of fun experimenting with different
types<00:05:55.680> of<00:05:55.800> interfaces<00:05:56.099> for<00:05:56.789> example<00:05:57.150> if<00:05:57.330> John

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
types of interfaces for example if John

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.089 
types of interfaces for example if John
wants<00:05:57.779> to<00:05:57.840> see<00:05:57.960> inside<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:58.469> car<00:05:58.680> there's<00:05:59.069> no

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
wants to see inside the car there's no

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.800 
wants to see inside the car there's no
buttons<00:05:59.460> are<00:05:59.550> fired<00:05:59.729> he<00:05:59.849> just<00:06:00.060> taps<00:06:00.270> right<00:06:00.629> on

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
buttons are fired he just taps right on

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.950 
buttons are fired he just taps right on
the<00:06:00.900> car<00:06:02.330> we<00:06:03.330> have<00:06:03.419> so<00:06:03.569> much<00:06:03.689> screen<00:06:03.930> real

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
the car we have so much screen real

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.629 
the car we have so much screen real
estate<00:06:04.110> we<00:06:04.439> started<00:06:04.710> adding<00:06:04.830> fun<00:06:05.159> things<00:06:05.430> like

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
estate we started adding fun things like

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.490 
estate we started adding fun things like
the<00:06:05.759> shifter<00:06:06.090> again<00:06:06.389> really<00:06:06.840> intuitive<00:06:07.139> the

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
the shifter again really intuitive the

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.689 
the shifter again really intuitive the
user<00:06:07.650> just<00:06:07.800> swipes<00:06:08.039> up<00:06:08.219> and<00:06:08.400> down<00:06:08.490> with<00:06:08.610> his

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
user just swipes up and down with his

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.959 
user just swipes up and down with his
finger<00:06:09.000> to<00:06:09.210> change<00:06:09.419> gears<00:06:10.550> we<00:06:11.550> also<00:06:11.699> have<00:06:11.849> so

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
finger to change gears we also have so

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.369 
finger to change gears we also have so
much<00:06:12.090> screen<00:06:12.210> real<00:06:12.360> estate<00:06:12.449> we<00:06:12.750> added<00:06:12.960> mirrors

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 
much screen real estate we added mirrors

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.170 
much screen real estate we added mirrors
simply<00:06:13.889> tap<00:06:14.129> on<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.400> mirror<00:06:14.639> to<00:06:14.879> look<00:06:15.029> behind

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
simply tap on the mirror to look behind

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.450 
simply tap on the mirror to look behind
you

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.159 

yeah<00:06:20.460> well<00:06:20.970> kind<00:06:21.270> of<00:06:21.389> careful<00:06:22.020> where<00:06:22.110> you're

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
yeah well kind of careful where you're

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.610 
yeah well kind of careful where you're
looking<00:06:22.470> at<00:06:22.560> your<00:06:22.680> driving<00:06:24.410> but<00:06:25.410> other<00:06:25.530> than

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620

just<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.830> large<00:06:26.100> screen<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:26.669> being

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
just a large screen and it being

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.999 
just a large screen and it being
completely<00:06:27.120> touch<00:06:27.360> sensitive<00:06:27.870> again<00:06:28.470> for<00:06:28.919> us

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
completely touch sensitive again for us

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.650 
completely touch sensitive again for us
performance<00:06:29.639> is<00:06:29.759> really<00:06:29.910> important<00:06:30.509> and<00:06:30.630> a

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
performance is really important and a

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.150 
performance is really important and a
game<00:06:30.810> like<00:06:30.930> Need<00:06:31.139> for<00:06:31.169> Speed<00:06:31.320> really<00:06:31.830> pushes

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
exactly how fast this device in this

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:44.580 
exactly how fast this device in this
game<00:06:35.340> really<00:06:35.759> goes
