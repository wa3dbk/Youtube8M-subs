 North of Portugal there is almost on land 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.360

 sagardi looking throughout the year 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 to sacrifice them now that meat and 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.060
 comes with a few days of maturation and we 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.429
 he brings it to the place ready to roast 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.479
 grill to make it well this meat what 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.690
 what we have to do is leave it 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.429
 temper a few hours out of the fridge 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.020
 it's cold in the fridge if it's not going to 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.289
 Be well cooked and then a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.000
 grill like oak charcoal with 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.560
 a lot of anger has to be the grill 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.929
 to make a good seal to the meat 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.720
 the masters first closing one of the 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.340
 faces and that very close to the embers with 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.229
 A lot of candle has to make a seal 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.689
 very general so you do not lose games 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.190
 so that it concentrates flavors we are going to 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.410
 turn around we are going to take the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.240
 first layer of salt as it goes by 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.880
 the second side 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.860
 a desired second face we return it to 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.900
 flip we throw you out the second side 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.750
 and in the first, what we will do is toast 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.030
 that first salt that we put we give a 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.200
 last round will toast the second salt 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.400
 we remove it and more or less the cooking goes 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.100
 to last this whole process that I've 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.950
 explained from the sales not by minute by 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.250
 every 100 grams of the piece we talk about 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.260
 chops from kilo to kilo 800 which 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.030
 we are going to have today every year a 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.160
 weight wee bit because we are talking 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.680
 from 10 to 18 minutes for each piece of 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.290
 meat from there is removed is left to rest 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.000
 half a minute or so that we cut 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.260
 to separate the bone and from here 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.260
 we already place them to serve 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.670
