 phone via the two eh ben it's 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.140
 super hard because the phone there is 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.570
 all about it when you want to do 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 a photo beat the closeness when you have 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.480
 want to call a friend or call 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.350
 Somebody beat you do you want to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.270
 social beat the a so phone that one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 need it what's vital I find 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.649
 so of today yes quite 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 that is to say when it was not finished 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.640
 the weekend we had our phones and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.110
 so to talk to my loved ones because 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 the phone between France realizes a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.320
 little bit expensive so I used watsa 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.000
 can to take news 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.770
 cute it's me ugly and naughty it's 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.149
 the small millions that run you have to 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 do small activities and others 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.640
 made banana stuff 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.530
 frankly that's good I like a lot 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 this game yes then there is an application 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.070
 or in fact I'm doing collages it's up to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.990
 say when I have pictures for example 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 I 'm dressed one way and I want 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.280
 we see in two positions difference 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.990
 so I'm doing small collages and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.150
 then there is the other application so 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.770
 served nothing like that where I can 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.170
 change the complexion 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 of the face when I have pimples by 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.289
 example I try to hide when I have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.429
 little things to be a little bit more 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.990
 I was so here I am these two 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.820
 applications then twitter it's 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.520
 really the application to which I 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 I do not have duras 24 but often I 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.250
 find it really interesting people 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 really follow us because they 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.679
 appreciate 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.600
 unlike for example in facebook where 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.829
 there are more things there are so many 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.420
 positive things that negative 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.280
 so it's true that twitter I find that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.780
 well because even the stars that you 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.429
 kiffes beat to follow them you can 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.509
 see what they write so less 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.079
 it's really my application 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.149
 favorite 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.729
 yes then I have youtube for music 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.950
 I have my channel elsewhere here in Chanac 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.959
 remains where we can find 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.979
 I workout videos I sing so 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.689
 it is true that suddenly I go often 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.030
 on it to see if I have any views what 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.560
 tell people all that and the second 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.140
 it's 10 o'clock yes it's only for 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.880
 listen to music on the train when 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.900
 we take the plane of the sport it's true that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.739
 it's pretty public practice people 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.840
 yeah to follow a little bit everything 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.000
 happens in the star legends 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.959
 laterality it appears more 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.129
 directly as soon as there is something 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.110
 of interest is displayed on your 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.420
 phone to greek and so it's not bad 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.040
 public yes so that's shine created this 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 point as who is currently in 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.060
 to update itself but that's it 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.430
 it's a blog where we can 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.530
 play but actuality 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.970
 for example if we want to bouquet and 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.889
 ali number of the contact person 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.900
 the dates we make in France every 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.269
 weekends are a lot of things what 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.389
 unpublished photos straw 18 this is full of 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.389
 things 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300
 and
