apart from running being a fantastic
sport<00:00:14.880> unfortunately<00:00:15.450> what<00:00:15.990> does<00:00:16.230> happen<00:00:16.440> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
sport unfortunately what does happen is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.160 
sport unfortunately what does happen is
that<00:00:17.130> compared<00:00:17.610> to<00:00:17.670> walking<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.660> means<00:00:18.930> that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
that compared to walking it means that

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.960 
that compared to walking it means that
there's<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> lot<00:00:19.650> more<00:00:19.920> load<00:00:20.279> needs<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.880> be

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
there's a lot more load needs to be

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
there's a lot more load needs to be
absorbed<00:00:21.480> through<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> body<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.590> often

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
absorbed through the body and this often

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.339 
absorbed through the body and this often
gets<00:00:23.099> taken<00:00:23.279> by<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.610> knees<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.300> hips<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
gets taken by the knees the hips and the

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.980 
gets taken by the knees the hips and the
pelvis<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:25.920> lower<00:00:26.160> back<00:00:26.509> so<00:00:27.509> that<00:00:27.750> means

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
pelvis and the lower back so that means

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.350 
pelvis and the lower back so that means
that<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:28.590> you're<00:00:28.800> not<00:00:28.950> strong<00:00:29.279> enough<00:00:29.310> sort<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
that if you're not strong enough sort of

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.790 
that if you're not strong enough sort of
around<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> trunk<00:00:31.050> usually<00:00:31.529> around<00:00:31.680> the

around the trunk usually around the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
around the trunk usually around the
pelvis<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.360> means<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.690> when<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.899> are

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
pelvis then it means that when you are

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.050 
pelvis then it means that when you are
running<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.620> harder<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.130> absorb<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
running it's harder to absorb some of

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.490 
running it's harder to absorb some of
that<00:00:36.149> extra<00:00:36.570> load<00:00:36.780> which<00:00:37.020> means<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that extra load which means that the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.680 
that extra load which means that the
joints<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:37.980> ligaments<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.360> muscles

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
joints and ligaments and the muscles

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.210 
joints and ligaments and the muscles
tend<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> sometimes<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.590> put<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:40.920> bit<00:00:41.130> of

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
tend to sometimes we put a little bit of

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.130 
tend to sometimes we put a little bit of
strain

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.259 

the<00:00:44.679> bridge<00:00:44.920> exercise<00:00:45.399> is<00:00:45.609> a<00:00:45.640> fantastic<00:00:46.149> way

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
the bridge exercise is a fantastic way

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.419 
the bridge exercise is a fantastic way
of<00:00:46.420> building<00:00:46.570> strength<00:00:47.350> it's<00:00:47.769> specially<00:00:48.280> good

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
of building strength it's specially good

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.200 
of building strength it's specially good
at<00:00:48.579> recruiting<00:00:49.179> the<00:00:49.629> gluteal<00:00:50.440> muscles<00:00:51.210> which

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
at recruiting the gluteal muscles which

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.149 
at recruiting the gluteal muscles which
are<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:52.539> sort<00:00:52.719> of<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.839> buttock<00:00:53.140> muscles<00:00:53.199> and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
are the sort of the buttock muscles and

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.039 
are the sort of the buttock muscles and
they're<00:00:54.309> really<00:00:54.729> important<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.659> help

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
they're really important to help

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.509 
they're really important to help
stabilize<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.710> lower<00:00:57.070> back

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
stabilize the lower back

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.250 
stabilize the lower back
especially<00:00:58.149> when<00:00:58.239> running<00:00:58.570> we're<00:00:58.899> absorbing

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
especially when running we're absorbing

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.590 
especially when running we're absorbing
a<00:00:59.469> lot<00:00:59.589> more<00:00:59.739> load<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.339> these<00:01:00.729> are<00:01:00.879> vital<00:01:01.420> to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
a lot more load and these are vital to

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.329 
a lot more load and these are vital to
be<00:01:01.689> able<00:01:01.869> to<00:01:02.019> absorb<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.619> loads<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.219> has

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
be able to absorb that loads that has

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:04.950 
be able to absorb that loads that has
not<00:01:03.489> been<00:01:03.699> taken<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.180> through<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.539> lower<00:01:04.720> back

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
not been taken in through the lower back

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.810 
not been taken in through the lower back
it's<00:01:05.409> also<00:01:05.619> a<00:01:05.740> great<00:01:05.950> exercise<00:01:06.189> because<00:01:06.520> it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
it's also a great exercise because it

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.429 
it's also a great exercise because it
encourages<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.630> extend<00:01:07.960> through<00:01:08.320> the

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
encourages you to extend through the

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.020 
encourages you to extend through the
lower<00:01:08.560> back<00:01:08.770> which<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.490> again<00:01:09.759> quite<00:01:09.939> a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
lower back which is again quite a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.639 
lower back which is again quite a
functional<00:01:10.509> activity<00:01:10.990> that<00:01:11.170> we<00:01:11.259> need<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.500> do

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
functional activity that we need to do

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.289 
functional activity that we need to do
and<00:01:11.950> also<00:01:12.340> allows<00:01:12.580> you<00:01:12.759> to<00:01:12.789> get<00:01:12.970> some<00:01:13.119> good

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
and also allows you to get some good

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.149 
and also allows you to get some good
mobility<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.380> back<00:01:14.530> when<00:01:14.740> people<00:01:15.039> are

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
mobility in the back when people are

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.789 
mobility in the back when people are
often<00:01:15.280> quite<00:01:15.549> stiff

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.160 

the<00:01:19.310> next<00:01:19.549> exercise<00:01:19.939> is<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.600> Happy<00:01:21.020> Feet

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
the next exercise is the Happy Feet

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.139 
the next exercise is the Happy Feet
exercise<00:01:21.680> which<00:01:21.950> I've<00:01:22.399> christened<00:01:22.759> happy

feet I'm not sure what the technical
term<00:01:24.619> for<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.130> but<00:01:25.759> it's<00:01:26.360> another<00:01:26.630> really

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
term for it is but it's another really
