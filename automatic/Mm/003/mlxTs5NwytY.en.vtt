skin so they go go Sylvia and I really
thought<00:04:02.719> I<00:04:02.780> wasn't<00:04:02.989> going<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.200> outspeed<00:04:03.560> him

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
thought I wasn't going to outspeed him

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.289 
thought I wasn't going to outspeed him
because<00:04:03.980> slower<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:04.489> turns<00:04:04.700> out<00:04:04.849> even<00:04:05.030> though

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
because slower but turns out even though

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.569 
because slower but turns out even though
he<00:04:05.420> has<00:04:05.510> 13<00:04:05.930> less<00:04:06.140> base<00:04:06.349> speed<00:04:06.680> than<00:04:06.890> me<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.370> i

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
he has 13 less base speed than me and i

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.849 
he has 13 less base speed than me and i
am-<00:04:07.879> feeling<00:04:08.269> zero<00:04:08.510> he's<00:04:08.810> still<00:04:09.049> technically

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
am- feeling zero he's still technically

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.339 
am- feeling zero he's still technically
slower<00:04:10.719> which<00:04:11.719> i<00:04:11.810> guess<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:11.959> good<00:04:12.079> to<00:04:12.260> know

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
slower which i guess is good to know
