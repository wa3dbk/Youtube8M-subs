00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bit of string so I'm not able to push

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.960 
bit of string so I'm not able to push
quite<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.810> much<00:01:22.049> weight<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.920> had<00:01:23.040> before<00:01:23.220> at

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
quite as much weight as I had before at

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.249 
quite as much weight as I had before at
least<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> same<00:01:24.990> amount<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
least not with the same amount of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.920 
least not with the same amount of
quality<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.890> rep<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.030> probably<00:01:27.299> could<00:01:27.630> still

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
quality of rep so I probably could still

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.600 
quality of rep so I probably could still
push<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.500> weight<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> used<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> terms<00:01:29.400> like

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
push the weight I used to in terms like

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210 
push the weight I used to in terms like
225<00:01:30.060> whatever<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.110> would<00:01:31.200> beep<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.979> less

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
225 whatever but it would beep for less

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.880 
225 whatever but it would beep for less
reps<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.299> probably<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.930> uglier<00:01:34.320> reps<00:01:34.619> too

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

bit<00:01:49.920> lighter<00:01:50.100> weight<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.869> really

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
bit lighter weight but really really

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
bit lighter weight but really really
even<00:01:52.740> more<00:01:52.920> than<00:01:53.009> before<00:01:53.070> digging<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
even more than before digging in to the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
even more than before digging in to the
time<00:01:54.600> under<00:01:54.899> tension<00:01:54.930> side<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> things<00:01:55.920> so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
time under tension side of things so

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
time under tension side of things so
instead<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.909> pushing<00:01:57.210> heavier<00:01:57.899> weight<00:01:58.110> faster

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
instead of pushing heavier weight faster

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.100 
instead of pushing heavier weight faster
I'm<00:01:58.860> moving<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> lighter<00:02:00.090> weight<00:02:00.360> slower<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I'm moving a lighter weight slower and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
I'm moving a lighter weight slower and
for<00:02:01.500> more<00:02:01.680> reps<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:02.939> trying<00:02:03.119> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
for more reps so I'm really trying to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.520 
for more reps so I'm really trying to
take<00:02:03.329> my<00:02:03.479> time<00:02:03.659> especially<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:04.259> negative

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
take my time especially than negative

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.050 
take my time especially than negative
with<00:02:04.619> these<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.280> I'm<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.909> bit

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
with these and I'm going a little bit

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.050 
with these and I'm going a little bit
faster<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.890> upside<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.099> stuff<00:02:08.520> but

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
faster on the upside of this stuff but

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.729 
faster on the upside of this stuff but
that's<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:09.840> than<00:02:09.989> anything<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> try<00:02:10.679> to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that's more than anything just to try to

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.860 
that's more than anything just to try to
engage<00:02:11.129> my<00:02:11.340> muscles<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:11.790> much<00:02:11.940> as<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.180> try

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
engage my muscles as much as I can try

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.980 
engage my muscles as much as I can try
to<00:02:12.930> really<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.379> good

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
to really get a good

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.220 
to really get a good
but<00:02:14.710> on<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.000> negative<00:02:16.390> i<00:02:16.540> am<00:02:16.750> trying<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.140> go

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
but on the negative i am trying to go

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.900 
but on the negative i am trying to go
slow<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.800> i'm<00:02:17.920> really<00:02:18.040> trying<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.400> focus<00:02:18.580> on

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
slow and i'm really trying to focus on

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.330 
slow and i'm really trying to focus on
i'm<00:02:19.240> almost<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.810> my<00:02:19.930> mind<00:02:20.340> envisioning

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
i'm almost like in my mind envisioning

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.150 
i'm almost like in my mind envisioning
my<00:02:21.520> muscles<00:02:22.000> like<00:02:22.330> both<00:02:23.170> ripping<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> way

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
my muscles like both ripping on the way

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.920 
my muscles like both ripping on the way
down<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:24.700> really<00:02:25.030> inflating<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
down and then really inflating on the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.930 
down and then really inflating on the
way<00:02:26.050> up<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.470> when<00:02:27.100> I'm<00:02:27.190> going<00:02:27.370> down<00:02:27.580> I'm<00:02:27.610> being

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
way up so when I'm going down I'm being

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.360 
way up so when I'm going down I'm being
really<00:02:28.210> really<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.450> mindful<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.980> stretch

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
really really a mindful of this stretch

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.100 
really really a mindful of this stretch
I'm<00:02:30.970> sure<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.510> said<00:02:31.660> I'm<00:02:31.750> trying<00:02:32.020> to

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
I'm sure like I said I'm trying to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.690 
I'm sure like I said I'm trying to
imagine<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.740> muscle<00:02:33.040> fibers<00:02:33.070> actually

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
imagine like the muscle fibers actually

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.880 
imagine like the muscle fibers actually
like<00:02:33.850> individually<00:02:34.510> tearing<00:02:34.930> obviously<00:02:35.740> not

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
like individually tearing obviously not

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.530 
like individually tearing obviously not
tearing<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.400> bad<00:02:36.640> way<00:02:36.670> but<00:02:36.940> tearing<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
tearing in a bad way but tearing in the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.450 
tearing in a bad way but tearing in the
way<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.870> know<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.290> did<00:02:38.770> your<00:02:39.100> muscles

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
way that you know you did your muscles

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.400 
way that you know you did your muscles
tear<00:02:39.700> when<00:02:39.880> they<00:02:39.970> improve<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.870> that's<00:02:41.230> kind<00:02:41.380> of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
tear when they improve so that's kind of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.480 
tear when they improve so that's kind of
how<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.590> works<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.100> break<00:02:42.340> your

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
how that works is that you break your

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.310 
how that works is that you break your
muscles<00:02:42.790> down<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.210> then<00:02:43.540> after<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.990> eat<00:02:44.140> some

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
muscles down and then after you eat some

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.200 
muscles down and then after you eat some
food<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.770> get<00:02:44.890> some<00:02:45.100> rest<00:02:45.340> they<00:02:45.730> rebuild

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
food and get some rest they rebuild

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.540 
food and get some rest they rebuild
bigger<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.900> stronger<00:02:47.080> than<00:02:47.230> before<00:02:47.350> but<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.490> a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
bigger and stronger than before but on a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.770 
bigger and stronger than before but on a
diet<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.240> relationship<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.720> be

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
diet on that relationship I can be

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.910 
diet on that relationship I can be
rebuilding<00:02:50.200> bigger<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.590> stronger<00:02:50.740> than

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
rebuilding bigger and stronger than

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.980 
rebuilding bigger and stronger than
before<00:02:51.040> at<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.580> moment<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.420> i<00:02:52.600> do<00:02:52.660> want<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
before at the moment but i do want to

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.590 
before at the moment but i do want to
give<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.530> much<00:02:53.830> quality<00:02:54.190> reps<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:55.210> i<00:02:55.300> can

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
give them as much quality reps as i can

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.080 
give them as much quality reps as i can
so<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.470> idea<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.760> muscle<00:02:58.060> fibers

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
so that idea of the muscle fibers

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.390 
so that idea of the muscle fibers
tearing<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.840> little<00:02:59.080> bit<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.410> its<00:02:59.980> there's<00:03:00.280> one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
tearing a little bit is its there's one

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.500 
tearing a little bit is its there's one
of<00:03:00.670> those<00:03:00.760> things<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.090> keep<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.360> my<00:03:01.390> mind

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
of those things that I keep in my mind

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.690 
of those things that I keep in my mind
and<00:03:02.410> then<00:03:02.470> obviously<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.220> way<00:03:03.400> up<00:03:03.520> I'm

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
and then obviously on the way up I'm

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.550 
and then obviously on the way up I'm
really<00:03:03.880> trying<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.300> re-inflate<00:03:04.990> my<00:03:05.140> muscles

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
really trying to re-inflate my muscles

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.930 
really trying to re-inflate my muscles
as<00:03:05.650> much<00:03:05.770> as<00:03:05.860> possible<00:03:06.010> trying<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.580> push<00:03:06.790> as

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
as much as possible trying to push as

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.150 
as much as possible trying to push as
much<00:03:06.970> blood<00:03:07.420> into<00:03:07.630> them<00:03:07.750> as<00:03:07.870> possible<00:03:08.320> trying

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
much blood into them as possible trying

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.800 
much blood into them as possible trying
to<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.430> as<00:03:09.670> much<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.390> complete

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
to have as much of a complete

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.690 
to have as much of a complete
contraction<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.590> chest<00:03:11.890> muscle<00:03:11.950> as<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.460> can

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
contraction of the chest muscle as I can

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.160 
contraction of the chest muscle as I can
so<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.270> don't<00:03:13.720> think<00:03:13.840> they're<00:03:13.930> kind<00:03:14.050> of<00:03:14.080> like

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
so I don't think they're kind of like

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.600 
so I don't think they're kind of like
strange<00:03:14.530> analogies<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.040> I'm<00:03:15.220> making<00:03:15.490> it<00:03:15.580> my

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
strange analogies that I'm making it my

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.970 
strange analogies that I'm making it my
workouts<00:03:16.030> but<00:03:16.390> these<00:03:17.140> are<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.500> things<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.830> I
