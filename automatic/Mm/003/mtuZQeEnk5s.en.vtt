00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 c 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.240
 well it's all dark 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.619
 star 61 1903 and today we are 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.880
 to find a new video on 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.770
 mysteries of gta 5 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.810
 so today we will talk about a 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.070
 mystery which is for me the most concrete 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.930
 for now in gta 5 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.210
 because it's the one for which we have a little 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.460
 the most information bearing that poor 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.019
 many people think that a lot of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.000
 forgotten people or even and we wore no 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.920
 interest and yet when you think about it 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.960
 it's really logical what and I 'm going 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.640
 bring you evidence that I think 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.339
 that you did not know so I think 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.720
 after you will believe this mystery 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.789
 so firstly do you 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.350
 remember the meteorite so the 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.510
 meteorite that was found in the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.270
 source code of the game by the modders and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.760
 hacker so they managed to make them 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.340
 appear in play so one they did 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.080
 appear before his true height with his 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.030
 real textures so we're sure she 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.890
 exists in the game but where we do not know 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.710
 we do not know where sky in the game but 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.750
 we are sure that she is there then 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.759
 he says is very weird 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.270
 it is the observatory the observatory 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.940
 what an idea, as I say, we have 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.670
 learned by yet modders that the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.979
 roof could break and that the roof there 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.410
 there was a party that could be removed 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.330
 in the game so why are we 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.250
 talk about that part of the roof 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.250
 how to remove even the whole 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.810
 part of the observatory for is broken 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.440
 so one what I think is the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 meteorite 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.880
 and here I am just bringing you the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.300
 evidence so for me the meteorite gets 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.020
 crash in the observatory and I'm going 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.020
 show you why 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 when they left the game there was the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.960
 collector version that brought 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.370
 bonus in- game and a map a map of 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.370
 los santos but not as in the 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.950
 normal boxes she was blue and her 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.160
 particularity it is is that with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.540
 purple hatchback art lamps and well that 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.860
 had things displayed on the map 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.840
 so full of indications on the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.460
 card where to find small bonuses in 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.070
 the weapon style game of things like 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.980
 that but also a lot of 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.600
 rather special steel things that binds to 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.180
 aliens here things like that then 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.640
 we do not see it and something really 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.530
 very special is that here I have the map 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.730
 decode wholesale with all 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.640
 information that there may be su 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.739
 look good here there are marked all 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.110
 force the story roughly to shoot the 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.300
 stars shoot for the stars en route 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.040
 yesterday to the stars 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.989
 and as if by chance here on the map 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.420
 that's where well it's there it's in 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.890
 the observatory is right here well we 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.820
 can regain a long view and a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.230
 sniper so long for everyone 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.299
 uses it for applicants people 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.290
 is used to say to look at life 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.630
 or anything but for me then 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.420
 to uselessness and sniper the sniper 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.590
 everyone says it's all about stars 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.709
 well it's just because there is a sniper 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.030
 but why look complicated there are 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.680
 whom we had seen in the buildings in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.170
 of fateh party stars why 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.340
 look complicated you just have to 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.670
 me thirith in the stars in the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.950
 sky 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.480
 because if there will be a meteorite is 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.549
 that would pull on it could do 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.989
 appear to be arriving towards us and 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.450
 the long view it's a server is 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.580
 just to see it happen it's 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.890
 logical in my opinion it's simple 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.930
 but logic we were shooting with the sniper 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.140
 on the meteorite what would make it come 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.769
 towards us and with the telescope have for 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.489
 l observe this crash is so long 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.120
 view that justifying and now I'm going 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.350
 show you another proof enough 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.360
 blatant that many people have 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.310
 seen that not many people have rather 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.810
 heard so that's really you 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.820
 surprise is at the ddt in the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.079
 gta radios so defect you know 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.730
 like on a radio times when the 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.349
 breaks between music and with the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.970
 news that tells you about news in gta 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.690
 style the cosef and a robbery he says who 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.180
 had technical problems at tata 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.050
 Well, it's very very rare but 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.810
 certain moments 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.130
 well we can hear this video there 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.240
 that I'm going through now so I 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.740
 I'm sorry it's in English this is 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.360
 not very good because it does not come 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.030
 not of me I would put the link of the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.209
 nobody in the chain but to try 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.209
 to understand 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.810
 so that's basically the video she 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.550
 says who has the news 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.380
 apocalyptic who would have a 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.330
 meteorite in the sky yes you do not dream 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.250
 not he speaks well that a meteorite 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.930
 a meteorite that would be in the sky 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.730
 who are dangerously approaching los 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.790
 santos and that would cause damage 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.410
 catastrophic so still some 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.910
 thing to link so after that 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.390
 personally I still believe 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.400
 more so for me this is the theory of a 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.760
 mysteries of gta 5 the most concrete 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.140
 good and surely that the observer 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.580
 could be broken by the meteorite and 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.710
 that we could find things in 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.840
 parts or even why not the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.190
 jetpack 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.020
 so if this video will have you more 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.120
 frankly leave a comment a 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.610
 like frankly I'm really surprised 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.780
 seeing all this because we are 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.100
 really think more with my cars 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.300
 rhythm and yet it's the most 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.560
 concrete that we have the jetpack we are not even 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.450
 not sure that the teeth but the weather and 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.740
 we have the proof 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.840
 so if that's when I tell you if you 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.010
 liked to share the docks commented if 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.880
 you have other theories and then 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.880
 Hello everyone
