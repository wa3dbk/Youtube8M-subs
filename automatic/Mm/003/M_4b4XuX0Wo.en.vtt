I guess forgot Windows Live has a lot of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.379 
I guess forgot Windows Live has a lot of
services<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.840> yes<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.559> somewhat<00:00:14.309> free<00:00:14.639> but

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
services and yes it is somewhat free but

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.200
