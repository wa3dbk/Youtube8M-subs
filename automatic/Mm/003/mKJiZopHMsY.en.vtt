receiver 2.4 gigahertz this camera don't
zoom<00:01:18.180> too<00:01:18.509> good<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.409> too<00:01:19.590> clear<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:19.979> i

pretty good setup I like it I like the
looks<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.729> i<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.770> improvement<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040

looks of it i like the improvement of it
in<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.899> looks<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.490> hopefully<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
in the looks and hopefully the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
in the looks and hopefully the
performance<00:01:51.149> category<00:01:51.329> too<00:01:51.840> once<00:01:52.110> i<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.409> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
performance category too once i get it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.510 
performance category too once i get it
going<00:01:54.079> like<00:01:55.079> say<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.799> by<00:01:55.950> pushing<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
going like say it just by pushing this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.380 
going like say it just by pushing this
back<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.969> forth<00:01:57.060> i<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> tell<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:59.390> mean

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
back and forth i can kind of tell I mean

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
back and forth i can kind of tell I mean
it's<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.259> free<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> should<00:02:02.700> be

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it's not really free like it should be

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.060 
it's not really free like it should be
that's<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.930> feels<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.560> belts<00:02:04.890> too

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's it just feels like the belts too

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940 
that's it just feels like the belts too
tight<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.469> I'll<00:02:07.469> probably<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.829> have

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
tight on it so I'll probably just have

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.529 
tight on it so I'll probably just have
to<00:02:08.160> figure<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> tweak<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> little

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
to figure that out and tweak it a little

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.470 
to figure that out and tweak it a little
bit<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.160> have<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.310> read<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> forums<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
bit I have to read up on the forums and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.839 
bit I have to read up on the forums and
see<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:12.930> other

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
maybe it just has to loosen with time I

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:29.069
