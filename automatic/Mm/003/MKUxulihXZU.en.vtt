00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 So for the mask we need 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.230
 colorless on my company artcolor I 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.389
 I'll take more olive but because she 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.820
 dries their hair needs to be moistened and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 supplements to everything for nourishing hair i 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.230
 I will add two essential oils from me 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.199
 there will be patchouli essential oil and lang lang and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.420
 we also need a cup of hot 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.890
 water boiled for mixing something 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.019
 me in this case it will be a knife and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.550
 definitely not necessary 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.529
 aluminum surface of the plastic itself 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 wooden year only not iron Czech 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.000
 will need to respond and highlights 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.700
 toxins and on my average hair length 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 25 gram henna sachet open and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:44.969
 I pour out into the water so well I spilled water 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.469
 now we have to mix everything well 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 up to 1 rolls of him turned us pretty 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.420
 mixture without lumps of such liquid sour cream 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.129
 and here I will add a tablespoon 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.320
 olive oil and one drop 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 essential oils 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.390
 add a tablespoon of oil to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 hair did not listen and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:17.280
 moisturizing and 1 drop of essential oils 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 and once again for good change that's all 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.090
 our mask is ready now left 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.640
 apply on hair parting 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.560
 and on clay on a donut I advise you 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 apply oil attached to any base 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.070
 so that the hair is no longer 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.579
 listened and were moistened and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.000
 retained their moisture and inflict on the whole 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.610
 the length over the oil is still over their weight 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.130
 our mask is now ready for us 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.759
 comb hair and comb 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.759
 I wisely Moore 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:58.060
 so i'm prescribed techno left ear by 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.399
 Pro going into work will be easier and hair 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.590
 will be brighter kidding over the set we 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.409
 we remove all the hair on one side 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.250
 absolutely any determined by parting 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.129
 this is how we apply henna 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.510
 either with your hands or with a brush 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.569
 I'm not wearing now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.400
 fingers parted 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:24.870
 killing the scalp although march but not 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.030
 started doing the next parting 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.170
 remove hair strand 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.910
 normal smell on the parting and so did 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.340
 all over the head with all the devices for those 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.700
 a couple of the occipital part put henna on 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.700
 the root 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.200
 and now this skin has been worked out 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.570
 we smell smell like I said talk 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.710
 we smear the tips with any base oil 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.710
 full length hair 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.920
 so our but across the head I share 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.530
 head on slices or whatever 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.040
 twist we wear henna and leave it 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.320
 15-20 minutes to not overdry 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.320
 hair and then wash off with warm water not 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.150
 then girls, I washed the mask from the hair 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.850
 used her pony shampoo 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.490
 Dear to with sea buckthorn and then a concert 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.520
 supplemented all this with a mask of recipes 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.200
 Agafya's grandmothers with yeast and sour 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.090
 milk and now i'm a little 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.400
 prodivila their movements promakivayuschimi 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.110
 hair and leave in that position 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.420
 not naturally dried 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.550
 using a hair dryer when the mask effect 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.459
 note will be higher now evening 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.300
 so the effect of the mask I will photograph 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.100
 tomorrow and lay out at the end of the video can not 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.170
 madly in love and if uses 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.270
 the composition of olive oil or any 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.220
 another dinner and a base oil from hair 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.410
 will not be dried as i have said and 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.890
 the hair is insanely smooth 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.810
 insanely beautiful shiny she is good 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.720
 strengthens hair also makes hair 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.880
 thicker and stronger and it is generally in general 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.950
 a positive effect on the brain on the skin 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.229
 heads therefore I advise everyone to this recipe 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.760
 try it and you do not be afraid of the window nothing 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.630
 bad with your do with you if you 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.630
