00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
basically this is what it looks like it
again<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.509> perk

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
again it has that same kind of perk

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.420 
again it has that same kind of perk
shape<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.650> from<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> perk

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
shape that you get from all the perk

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
shape that you get from all the perk
machines<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> has<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> spider<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> which

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
machines and it has a spider on it which

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.460 
machines and it has a spider on it which
is<00:01:31.950> absolutely<00:01:32.490> insane<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.780> looks<00:01:34.049> like<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is absolutely insane it looks like you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
is absolutely insane it looks like you
know<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.740> don't<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> worry<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.909> might<00:01:36.090> be

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
know we don't have to worry we might be

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.310 
know we don't have to worry we might be
getting<00:01:36.360> something<00:01:36.720> different<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> looks

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
getting something different it looks

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
getting something different it looks
like<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> wine<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.909> time

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
like it's going to be a wine this time

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.140 
like it's going to be a wine this time
instead<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> Cola<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.430> beer<00:01:42.119> or

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
instead of just like a Cola or a beer or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
instead of just like a Cola or a beer or
something<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> wine<00:01:43.710> bottle

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
something it's going to be a wine bottle

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
something it's going to be a wine bottle
and<00:01:44.310> gives<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> different<00:01:44.939> abilities<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and gives you different abilities I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
and gives you different abilities I
assume<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.200> don't<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.040> is

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
assume I don't really know if this is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.800 
assume I don't really know if this is
just<00:01:47.220> them<00:01:47.610> putting<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.689> do

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
just them putting it there but if we do

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
just them putting it there but if we do
pay<00:01:48.990> attention<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.829> did<00:01:50.040> say<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
pay attention they did say that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
pay attention they did say that
everything<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.270> usually<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.960> it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
everything that they usually do it's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530 
everything that they usually do it's
very<00:01:52.619> meticulous<00:01:53.310> they<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.670> very<00:01:54.060> very

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
very meticulous they are very very

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.969 
very meticulous they are very very
thorough<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.140> everything<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.590> they<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.799> from

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
thorough of everything that they do from

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
thorough of everything that they do from
editing<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> stuff<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.270> they

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
editing and stuff like that so they

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.240 
editing and stuff like that so they
wouldn't<00:01:57.840> show<00:01:57.990> something<00:01:58.439> off<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> show

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
wouldn't show something off just to show

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
wouldn't show something off just to show
it<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.850> usually<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.450> some<00:02:00.630> sort<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it off there usually is some sort of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.840 
it off there usually is some sort of
hitting<00:02:01.229> meaning<00:02:01.649> behind<00:02:01.829> something<00:02:02.430> so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
hitting meaning behind something so

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.179 
hitting meaning behind something so
there<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> wine<00:02:04.049> bottle<00:02:04.290> widows
