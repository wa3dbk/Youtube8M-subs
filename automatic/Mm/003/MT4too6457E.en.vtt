going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> talk<00:00:21.750> about<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.230> an<00:00:23.100> exercise<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
going to talk about is an exercise that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.099 
going to talk about is an exercise that
I<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.390> do

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
I really like to do

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.019 
I really like to do
it's<00:00:25.619> one<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> most<00:00:26.070> simple<00:00:26.189> answers<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.970> do

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
it's one of the most simple answers I do

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.230 
it's one of the most simple answers I do
is<00:00:27.869> taking<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> middle<00:00:28.619> F<00:00:29.000> what<00:00:30.000> we're<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
is taking a middle F what we're going to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.680 
is taking a middle F what we're going to
do<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.779> extend<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> dynamic<00:00:31.650> range<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
do is to extend the dynamic range of the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
do is to extend the dynamic range of the
instrument<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.260> we're<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> start<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
instrument so we're going to start a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
instrument so we're going to start a
fairly<00:00:35.700> middle<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> road<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.510> about<00:00:36.809> MP

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
fairly middle of the road from about MP

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
fairly middle of the road from about MP
to<00:00:37.469> Forte<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.520> back<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> MP<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:39.870> just

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to Forte and back to MP and we're just

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
to Forte and back to MP and we're just
going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> hairpin<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
going to do a hairpin so if gonna do a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.600 
going to do a hairpin so if gonna do a
question<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.629> diminuendo<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.710> starting

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
question do and diminuendo so starting

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.190 
question do and diminuendo so starting
off<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> comfortable<00:00:45.300> dynamic<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.960> find

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
off a comfortable dynamic just to find

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
off a comfortable dynamic just to find
the<00:00:46.590> sound<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.190> make<00:00:47.910> everything<00:00:48.149> relaxed<00:00:48.539> so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the sound and make everything relaxed so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:03.859 
the sound and make everything relaxed so
there's<00:00:49.950> nothing<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.489> said<00:00:50.670> about<00:00:50.850> MP

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.490 

so<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.110> next<00:01:05.290> thing<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.500> do<00:01:06.899> it's<00:01:07.899> trying<00:01:08.350> not

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
so the next thing to do it's trying not

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.010 
so the next thing to do it's trying not
to<00:01:08.560> do<00:01:08.920> make<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.030> sound<00:01:10.270> go<00:01:10.450> away<00:01:10.479> from<00:01:10.930> the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
to do make the sound go away from the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.510 
to do make the sound go away from the
flu<00:01:11.229> what<00:01:11.649> naturally<00:01:12.070> happens<00:01:12.130> with<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
flu what naturally happens with the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.130 
flu what naturally happens with the
fleet<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:13.000> I'll<00:01:13.119> demonstrate<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.960> that

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
fleet is this I'll demonstrate is that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.410 
fleet is this I'll demonstrate is that
they'll<00:01:14.290> get<00:01:14.439> sharp<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.670> error<00:01:15.880> will<00:01:16.090> go<00:01:16.119> away

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
they'll get sharp the error will go away

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.389 
they'll get sharp the error will go away
from<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.840> flute<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.350> pitch<00:01:17.920> will<00:01:18.100> scoop

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
from the flute and the pitch will scoop

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.420 
from the flute and the pitch will scoop
up<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.479> also<00:01:19.810> you'll<00:01:20.110> lose<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.710> quality<00:01:21.100> of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
up and also you'll lose the quality of

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.330 
up and also you'll lose the quality of
the<00:01:21.520> sewing<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.509> I'll<00:01:23.500> just<00:01:23.680> demonstrate<00:01:23.830> what

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
the sewing so I'll just demonstrate what

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:33.810 
the sewing so I'll just demonstrate what
and<00:01:24.460> lots<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.670> practice<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.399> can<00:01:33.520> hear<00:01:33.700> the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
and lots of practice as you can hear the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.249 
and lots of practice as you can hear the
pitch<00:01:34.030> goes<00:01:34.240> really<00:01:34.420> high<00:01:34.539> on<00:01:34.750> end<00:01:34.899> drops<00:01:35.080> down

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
pitch goes really high on end drops down

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.410 
pitch goes really high on end drops down
again<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:35.799> what<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.429> have<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.670> do<00:01:36.819> is<00:01:36.970> he<00:01:37.060> offers

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
again so what we have to do is he offers

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.620 
again so what we have to do is he offers
it<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.530> so<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.100> as<00:01:39.250> we<00:01:39.399> get<00:01:39.520> louder<00:01:39.819> you

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
it to that so that as we get louder you

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.029 
it to that so that as we get louder you
drop<00:01:40.899> everything<00:01:41.140> relax<00:01:41.649> you're<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
drop everything relax you're on the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.340 
drop everything relax you're on the
shore<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:43.360> begin<00:01:43.630> with<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.899> want<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.080> start

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
shore to begin with you want to start

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.199 
shore to begin with you want to start
much<00:01:44.830> much<00:01:45.100> higher<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.909> you're<00:01:46.060> almost

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
much much higher so that you're almost

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.469 
much much higher so that you're almost
on<00:01:46.659> tiptoes<00:01:47.380> not<00:01:48.190> physically<00:01:48.580> but<00:01:48.909> you

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
on tiptoes not physically but you

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.779 
on tiptoes not physically but you
imagine<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:50.140> say<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.679> my<00:01:50.860> little<00:01:50.890> kids

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
imagine that I say to my little kids

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.190 
imagine that I say to my little kids
that<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:51.940> teach<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.600> actually<00:01:52.869> be<00:01:52.990> like<00:01:53.140> a

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that I teach that you actually be like a

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.020 
that I teach that you actually be like a
seal<00:01:53.560> with<00:01:53.709> a<00:01:53.770> ball<00:01:53.950> on<00:01:54.100> interview<00:01:54.490> Nessa<00:01:54.819> so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
seal with a ball on interview Nessa so

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.490 
seal with a ball on interview Nessa so
that<00:01:55.270> literally<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.959> bringing<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.289> chin

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
that literally just bringing the chin

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.949 
that literally just bringing the chin
forward<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.009> Amish<00:01:57.220> with<00:01:57.369> straight<00:01:57.580> forward

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
forward the Amish with straight forward

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.359 
forward the Amish with straight forward
and<00:01:58.959> then<00:01:59.289> how<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.470> get<00:01:59.709> louder<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.130> drop

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
and then how to get louder you drop

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.580 
and then how to get louder you drop
everything<00:02:00.549> it's<00:02:01.119> relaxed<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.720> then<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:02.439> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
everything it's relaxed and then do the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.270 
everything it's relaxed and then do the
opposite<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.130> back<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.789> original

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
opposite to go back to the original

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.249 
opposite to go back to the original
penis<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.759> let's<00:02:07.030> try<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.330> slightly<00:02:07.660> quite<00:02:08.080> an

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
penis so let's try it slightly quite an

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:22.630 
penis so let's try it slightly quite an
hour<00:02:08.379> going<00:02:08.590> through<00:02:08.679> pianos<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.429> maybe<00:02:09.580> 40

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.190 

I'm<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:23.939> trying<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.329> do<00:02:24.510> each<00:02:24.659> time<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.109> get

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
I'm really trying to do each time we get

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.110 
I'm really trying to do each time we get
louder<00:02:25.469> and<00:02:25.829> starting<00:02:26.370> from<00:02:26.489> very<00:02:26.640> quietly<00:02:27.000> as

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
louder and starting from very quietly as

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.630 
louder and starting from very quietly as
well<00:02:27.299> is<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.019> get<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.500> very<00:02:28.739> soft<00:02:29.010> attack<00:02:29.340> so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
well is to get the very soft attack so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.539 
well is to get the very soft attack so
with<00:02:29.879> no<00:02:30.120> articulation<00:02:30.989> at<00:02:31.109> school<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
with no articulation at school just to

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.979 
with no articulation at school just to
try<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.879> find<00:02:33.030> where<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.329> sound<00:02:33.629> is<00:02:33.840> getting

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
try and find where the sound is getting

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.959 
try and find where the sound is getting
the<00:02:34.379> entre<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.799> right<00:02:34.950> place<00:02:35.219> and<00:02:35.489> then

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
the entre on the right place and then

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.990 
the entre on the right place and then
for<00:02:36.150> Jesus<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.980> under<00:02:38.310> set<00:02:38.519> each<00:02:38.730> time

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
for Jesus a and under set each time

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.699 
for Jesus a and under set each time
we're<00:02:39.150> doing<00:02:39.209> lots<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.719> bigger<00:02:40.109> dynamic<00:02:40.500> range

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
we're doing lots of bigger dynamic range

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.619 
we're doing lots of bigger dynamic range
so<00:02:41.159> eventually<00:02:41.459> what<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:41.879> want<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.209> do<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.450> to

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
so eventually what you want to do is to

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.740 
so eventually what you want to do is to
have<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:43.530> 100<00:02:43.920> percent<00:02:44.329> it's<00:02:45.329> something

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
have your 100 percent it's something

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.000 
have your 100 percent it's something
you've<00:02:45.900> never<00:02:45.959> really<00:02:46.349> doing<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.709> concert

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
you've never really doing a concert

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.209 
you've never really doing a concert
situation<00:02:47.579> but<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:48.599> maybe<00:02:48.900> use<00:02:49.439> a<00:02:49.560> 80<00:02:49.859> percent

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
situation but so maybe use a 80 percent

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.129 
situation but so maybe use a 80 percent
of<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:50.939> you<00:02:51.420> really<00:02:51.629> want<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> find<00:02:51.989> out

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
of that but you really want to find out

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.629 
of that but you really want to find out
where<00:02:52.319> it's<00:02:52.439> the<00:02:52.590> Quietus<00:02:53.159> you<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.400> possibly

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
where it's the Quietus you can possibly

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.420 
where it's the Quietus you can possibly
play<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.299> also<00:02:54.810> where<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.439> flute<00:02:55.889> naturally

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
play and also where the flute naturally

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.890 
play and also where the flute naturally
wants<00:02:56.669> to<00:02:56.760> crack<00:02:57.090> at<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.419> owner<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:57.750> other

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
wants to crack at the owner of other

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.199 
wants to crack at the owner of other
edges<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.709> scale<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.220> really<00:02:59.579> push<00:03:00.180> it

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
edges of the scale so really push it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.360 
edges of the scale so really push it
where<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:00.930> almost<00:03:01.769> cracking<00:03:02.159> or<00:03:02.280> ease

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
where it is almost cracking or ease

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.099 
where it is almost cracking or ease
cracking<00:03:02.790> seeing<00:03:03.419> there<00:03:03.629> where<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.840> limit

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
cracking seeing there where that limit

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.140 
cracking seeing there where that limit
is<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.919> can<00:03:05.069> back<00:03:05.220> off<00:03:05.250> maybe<00:03:05.609> 5<00:03:05.849> or<00:03:05.879> 10%

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
is that you can back off maybe 5 or 10%

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.959 
is that you can back off maybe 5 or 10%
so<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.840> reach<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:07.829> maximum<00:03:07.950> dynamic<00:03:08.519> so

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:08.969 
so you reach your maximum dynamic so

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:55.210 
so you reach your maximum dynamic so
let's<00:03:09.569> try<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.139> bit<00:03:10.319> more<00:03:10.500> realistically

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.500 

so<00:03:56.220> here<00:03:56.580> in<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.700> last<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:57.090> it's<00:03:57.239> almost

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
so here in the last one it's almost

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.030 
so here in the last one it's almost
pregnant<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.080> would<00:03:58.170> still<00:03:58.440> try<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.709> push<00:03:58.920> it

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
pregnant I would still try and push it

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.520 
pregnant I would still try and push it
even<00:03:59.069> further<00:03:59.690> but<00:04:00.690> that's<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.989> kind<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.440> idea

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
even further but that's the kind of idea

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.100 
even further but that's the kind of idea
so<00:04:01.769> that's<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.459> recap<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:03.110> starting

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
so that's just to recap that starting

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.400 
so that's just to recap that starting
off<00:04:04.230> about<00:04:04.590> an<00:04:04.769> SOP<00:04:05.099> I<00:04:05.250> know<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:06.540> up<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.930> meso

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
off about an SOP I know going up to meso

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.100 
off about an SOP I know going up to meso
1440<00:04:08.310> coming<00:04:09.060> back<00:04:09.180> down<00:04:09.330> again<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.870> most

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
1440 coming back down again the most

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.270 
1440 coming back down again the most
important<00:04:10.440> thing<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.769> keep<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.069> same

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
important thing is to keep the same

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.640 
important thing is to keep the same
quality<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.819> saying<00:04:12.290> today<00:04:13.290> with<00:04:13.440> neighbor

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
quality of saying today with neighbor

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.440 
quality of saying today with neighbor
brighter<00:04:13.980> because<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.580> distorts<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.269> pitch

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
brighter because that distorts the pitch

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.879 
brighter because that distorts the pitch
and<00:04:15.599> also<00:04:15.750> gets<00:04:16.079> in<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.290> way<00:04:16.410> we<00:04:16.530> want<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.739> do

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
and also gets in the way we want to do

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.009 
and also gets in the way we want to do
it<00:04:16.979> just<00:04:17.100> purely<00:04:18.090> from<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.359> control<00:04:18.720> point<00:04:18.900> of

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
it just purely from a control point of

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.520 
it just purely from a control point of
view<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:20.070> know<00:04:20.220> how<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.609> just<00:04:20.940> blow<00:04:21.750> naturally

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
view to know how to just blow naturally

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.820 
view to know how to just blow naturally
through<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.830> flew<00:04:23.630> with<00:04:24.630> with<00:04:25.260> not<00:04:25.470> too<00:04:25.680> much

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
through the flew with with not too much

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.469 
through the flew with with not too much
gymnastics<00:04:26.520> when<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.760> only<00:04:26.910> shield<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:27.300> also

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
gymnastics when the only shield but also

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.620 
gymnastics when the only shield but also
just<00:04:27.900> getting<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.229> really<00:04:28.560> pure<00:04:28.800> tone<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:30.330> then

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
just getting a really pure tone and then

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.330 
just getting a really pure tone and then
as<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.900> said<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.410> second<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.889> third<00:04:32.070> time

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
as I said the second and third time

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.070 
as I said the second and third time
increasing<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.300> dynamic<00:04:33.660> range<00:04:33.810> they're

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
increasing the dynamic range they're

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.370 
increasing the dynamic range they're
going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.560> maybe<00:04:35.190> penis<00:04:35.970> America<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.660> 14<00:04:37.139> and

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
going to maybe penis America to 14 and
