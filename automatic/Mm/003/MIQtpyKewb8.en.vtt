00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.200
 brand new video and thanks for feedback 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.559

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.259
 it is about the following today and indeed has 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.150
 with tim one of our hardworking maniacs 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.160
 sent a few videos where he 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.750
 train yes I'll show you down here 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.789
 Just an example of Assisi 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.640
 when jumping rope just jump with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.410
 the phone short transversely held so to 16 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.269
 9-format resulted in me 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 made training video and I wanted 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.410
 ask you now if you are already here 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 video uploaded for us so has or 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.790
 have sent me one if you just 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 Sometime during the training somehow 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.899
 could show where you just go somewhere 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 in the studio, whether you are training at home 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.270
 whatever if we just bock it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 have which box and really cool 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.110
 motivation video for the channel 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.550
 and that's why yes it would be cool if you let me know 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.899
 could make such a training video and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 As always, send could at 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.420
 transfer just let me know and also 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.210
 to the people where I am not like that yet 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.940
 many could answer to the intense 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 I am sorry I am myself 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.000
 but i will definitely work 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.760
 do not carry on any help 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 we care everything will unravel if 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 they just have any 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 ambiguity is generally yours 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.759
 training or nutrition yes then easy 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.700
 post below 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.140
 I will become you too and that is it 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.720
 I have no problem I will you 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.420
 Now my trainings plan as excel 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.500
 document here under this video 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 to link 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.130
 you can just look at it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 do not want that now the accepts 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.040
 simply because every human being is one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.200
 a little different but I want this 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.600
 Just look in there like a plan 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 looks at me and then you can too 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.750
 if you just want the exercises 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.640
 could change that could cross out something 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.520
 insert another and have the excel 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.020
 document and gregor one of our 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 maniacs got me on that idea back then 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 brought everything a few weeks ago 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.720
 write down what you're writing 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 training is so you do yours 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.430
 set bench press with no idea 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.140
 400,000 kilos and then write afterwards 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.299
 on ok how much repetition I have 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 actually done and wear at the end 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.330
 you all in an excel table 1 and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.060
 is just crazy as crass 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.580
 motivated and what is one for 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.660
 Exclusions are what you then for 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.340
 can draw conclusions 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.750
 which exercise you might do on monday 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.340
 should do or what things are 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.230
 not so well tolerated which lightning 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.030
 work very well or on 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.170
 which training course is particularly striking 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.870

 and yes we would be cool if you give me one 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.460
 could send video of you where you 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.800
 Otherwise the training looks otherwise 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.780
