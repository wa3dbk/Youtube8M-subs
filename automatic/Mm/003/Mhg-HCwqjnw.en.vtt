00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.349
[Music]

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:22.410
Lurking in the depths of many a freezer are
abandoned, nameless, dateless bits of game

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.820
meat. Is it duck, could it be pigeon... are
they older than my children?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.890
Well, Cai is here to cleanse your conscience
and your freezer drawers.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.129
For our outdoor cooking taste-fest we'll be
using open fires, fire bowls and the very

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.840
cool and practical Dutch oven from Ronnie
Sunshines.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.280
To start with and to assist with keeping the
children fed and entertained during the school

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.719
holidays, Cai has chosen a child-friendly
recipe.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.699
So, today's menu is going to be deep-fried
pheasant breast in a 'sub' sandwich, coleslaw

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.280
- homemade, that is, with wild rocket, smoked
bacon and apple-wood cheddar. It is going

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.339
to be absolutely delicious. And not only is
it good for us, it is ideal for kids. You

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.660
have got young kids, families - it is a great
way to introduce game to younger people.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.210
So, first thing is first. I am going to start
making homemade mayonnaise.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.570
[Music]

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.000
A bit of Dijon.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.360
[Music]

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.869
So that is just about finished now. In a matter
of minutes we have just got some homemade

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.039
mayonnaise.It is ridiculously easy to do.
All it is I've got two egg yolks, a cup and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.479
a half of oil, a teaspoon-and-a-half of Dijon
mustard, a little bit of seasoning and half

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.109
a lemon gently squeezed into it. In four minutes
you have got mayonnaise that is by far better

00:01:48.109 --> 00:02:02.171
than anything you will buy in the shops.

00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:03.171
[Music]

00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:08.479
So that is the coleslaw done. Literally, just
got some cabbage, carrots, onions, lemon,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.980
apple - all very mice ingredients there -and
spring onion which gives it a bit of colour.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.069
So I am going to set that aside now and I
am going to concentrate on doing the pheasant.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.810
When you bring out your pheasant that you
have had in your freezer for quite a long

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.930
time, have a look at it and make sure it has
not got frostbite on it: hardening the edges.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.450
And make sure that it is not spoiled at all.
If a pheasant has been shot, make sure it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.391
has not gone moldy or gone off, or there are
any nasties in there. That's fine- you can

00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:40.760
trim that a bit. Give it a good inspection
before you start cooking with it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.260
So, when you are out in the woods in the middle
of nowhere and your resources are limited,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.260
some things you are going to have to improvise
with. So I have wiped it clean - I have got

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.200
my weapon of choice. Flatten the breast to
make it an even surface so it cooks quicker,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.330
and it cooks at the same time. Who needs a
steak hammer when you have got an axe?

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.510
Today we are doing this pheasant. but what
works equally well if not better is doing

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.330
it with partridge - slightly small breasts
and slightly sweeter in the meat. but pheasant

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.430
does work well. I wouldn't necessarily do
this with pigeon because with pigeon you don't

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.190
want to dry out too much, and it can get a
bit too tough in the middle.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.570
So, really I try and stick to the white meats
when I do this and leave the other recipes

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.960
for pigeon - things like that - quick pan
fried.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960
[Music]

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.650
You have got two set-ups you use in the Ronnie
Sunshines 'Dutch oven. What we have done is

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.690
we need to fry some bacon in a minute, so
we have got the lid, turned it over and we

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.450
are going to use that like a griddle, hot
plate.So, all I am going to be doing is getting

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.200
these pheasant breasts, dip them in the egg,
dip them in the seasoned bread crumbs, and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:59.390
I am literally going to shallow-fry them over
the fire, and that will be our escalope done.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.790
So what this is it kind of locks it in, and
because we are cooking this really fast and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.800
frying it, it keeps it moist in the centre.
Again, this is a really, really good way of

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:18.080
getting kids eating game, because they have
no idea of what it is.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.530
[Laughs]

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.980
Ow.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.430
[Music]

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.870
The thing is, because we are cooking outside,
on an open fire, it is very hard to regulate

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.090
the temperatures, so what we are trying to
do is to keep an eye on it, until it gets

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.860
golden on one side. We will flip it over to
the other side. hopefully it won't cook too

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.860
fast.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.010
Does that look good?

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.010
Really good.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.180
So we have got our ciabatta bread and we put
it on the barbecue so that's nice and toasted

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.310
a little bit on the inside there. So what
I am going to do now is get the pheasant breasts,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:09.970
a slice of the bacon, the homemade coleslaw.
I have got some smoked apple-wood cheddar

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:20.730
I am going to put on the top now. A layer
of rocket.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.730
That's a pheasant 'sub' sandwich.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.970
There you have ti.the pheasant - cooked perfectly
in the middle. Nice and juicy. The homemade

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.830
coleslaw, smoked apple-wood cheddar, the bacon
and the rocket.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.220
I am sorry but I cannot wait any longer.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.220
Mm.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.900
You have to try this at home.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.040
Are you enjoying that?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.260
Yup.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.490
[Laughs]

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.361
So there you have it, give KFC a miss and
give CFP a try â€“ Cai Fried Pheasant, and

00:05:57.361 --> 00:06:00.590
we guarantee children might eat it.
