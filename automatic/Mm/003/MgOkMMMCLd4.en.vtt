00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 and that now in the presence of harold of the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.019
 traditions with the picture of the gospel 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello welcome to another program 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.730
 pearls of the gospel 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.119
 today we are going to talk about a theme exists 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.260
 in the bible the word and spiritism 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.199
 the answer can only be a non 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.000
 definitely in the bible nor an old man 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.720
 testament much less a new 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Will aa word for Spiritualism 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 a very simple reason 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 this word was created by alan kardec 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 in 1857 when he edited the book of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.629
 spirits and he created that word for 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.149
 to name that book the doctrine that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.449
 that book implemented in the world 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.170
 at that time we do not have in the bible 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.570
 not even the description of anything 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.769
 that looks like spiritism 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.650
 in fact an imaginary of people 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.010
 who did not have the opportunity to study 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.010
 the spiritism of serious form and usually 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.299
 associate it with very old practices such as 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.320
 for example the practice of divination at 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.070
 practice of killing animals to practice 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.140
 sacrificing children to symbols 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.140
 practice to visualize some ghost or 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.860
 and I imagine that these 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.100
 divination magic practices 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.130
 oracle is a spiritualism 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.350
 indeed, spiritualism does not keep 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.990
 no relation to any of these 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.530
 practices of antiquity what the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.170
 spiritism does is explain the laws of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 nature that relate to the world 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.850
 spirit and the spirits and also the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.930
 relationships of the spiritual world with the world 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.810
 material 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.470
 therefore what is in the bible are 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.140
 references to practices 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:18.350
 at that time of 2 3 thousand 4 thousand years ago 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.660
 the spiritism in turn that signal 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.510
 lowes began to reach 1857 to define a 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.620
 set of activities a set of 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.680
 experiences has no relation to these 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.130
 practices even condemned in the bible 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.340
 so we need to be serious 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.700
 we have a scientific academic rigor to 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.900
 address this issue and do not place or 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.180
 We do not believe in some translations and 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.400
 responsible for replacing terms of the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.520
 Hebrew for the word 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:01.160
 spiritism leading to inducing people 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.670
 to believe that there are already 2 thousand 3 thousand 414 thousand 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.280
 years ago people did something 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.410
 like the spiritualists do today 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.510
 this does not, perhaps, require what 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.300
 left many people perplexed 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.370
 is the fact that bassinet has prohibited the 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.620
 contact with the dead 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.800
 but for this we need one more 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.620
 to remember that this bassinet prohibited this 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.920
 first conduct that it was possible to 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.890
 because no legislator forbids something that 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.060
 it is not possible as it was a practice 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:41.030
 then noticing the evil that that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.870
 conduct in that society 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.739
 at that time the Hebrew legislator 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.660
 understood to prohibit it and a reading 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.900
 of the Old Testament will 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.220
 a promise that at the end of the 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.870
 times 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.459
 there would be a shedding of the spirit 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.010
 divine over all flesh and the old 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:08.150
 young men and prophesy girls were going to 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.120
 dreams and visions softening that 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.540
 prohibition of the legislator 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.540
 Hebrew
