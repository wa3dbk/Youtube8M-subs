00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.250
 very good to everyone today fox grants me in 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.270
 this video I'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.130
 kill 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.080
 in the assault the peoples of invocation 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.570
 on the moon in ten shots from outside the 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.519
 map a trick that can serve you if 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.169
 you are making the contract to get 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.630
 the thorn and I'm playing by ourselves 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.480
 to kill sion the celibate and also in 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.790
 the weekly heroic assault and now that you 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.350
 they get with people in good matchmaking 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.970
 to do this trick what we have to 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.700
 do as you have seen is to get to 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.460
 where we are and we come to the 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.079
 end where the map running is not without 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.170
 shoot or anything we could shoot 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.340
 nothing happens , but we have good 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.230
 get here once we're 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.150
 here what we have to do is jump 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.840
 down though it seems that we're going 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.300
 fall 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.100
 and then as you are going to see here there is a 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.320
 cornice to which we can hook 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.329
 we have to stay in this cornice 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.739
 once we are here we would have 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.020
 so done the trick what we have 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.610
 what to do is jump up there 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.170
 with if we go with the hunter we can 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.030
 do with the double jump and with the triple 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.180
 jump with the hunter we would have to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.190
 support on that wall to not fall and 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.190
 it would be that easy from here since 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.450
 we could shoot at it every time 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.880
 we would have for them you know 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.710
 you need a weapon, people who carry a 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.300
 frank or better said that almost 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.210
 exclusively carry ammunition 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.280
 piercing here my colleagues are going to 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.670
 take little time to kill little but because 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.229
 it was a level 12 assault and I only 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.390
 was playing here for the lord is the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.670
 trick because I got more profitable than 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.220
 look for the assault there is that too 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.650
 fancy and good you can also 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.360
 shoot from here as you are going to see and 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.550
 you could shoot him and I say them from 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.960
 any place where you start and 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.910
 toads 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.229
 you're going to take lives with the ammunition 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.060
 perforante if you come here to see here you 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.399
 we shoot so you can see that you can 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.800
 we wait for an acolyte and there he is 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.840
 now you can shoot him well we have 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.360
 we are taking away life I do not know if well 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.860
 the video you see but we removed 617 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.130
 of lives for each shot also 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.220
 we could shoot him from down there 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.869
 piece of land that is there and good if this 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.759
 They do the three players as is 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.150
 would put in front of us then 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.049
 much easier to kill him because from 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.709
 here as you see 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.750
 I do not have a shot towards him but I do 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.640
 It would be much easier as I say 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.129
 because he would get in front and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.720
 we could kill also our 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.659
 say that this trick we could do 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 with the hunter and with the titan I with the 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.590
 sorcerer has not been able to do it 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.750
 is that it can not be done but I do not 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.220
 I control the sorcerer's jump well and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.220
 instead of jumping up jump to 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.409
 down then where is it when I go 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 to jump with the spark I fall with the 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.340
 titan as you see is even more 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.840
 easy that the hunter does not need to 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.459
 let's lean on the wall with the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.290
 Sorcerer , I already tell you if you 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.359
 controls plus the sorcerer too 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.799
 you can do it and nothing is all 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.420
 I hope you liked this trick 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.889
