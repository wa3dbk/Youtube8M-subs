00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
any concealer under my eyes I'm also

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
any concealer under my eyes I'm also
going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> leave<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> triangle<00:01:28.229> under<00:01:28.439> each<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
going to leave a triangle under each I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
going to leave a triangle under each I
where<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.400> put<00:01:29.549> any<00:01:29.700> Foundation<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.360> all

where I don't put any Foundation at all

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020 
where I don't put any Foundation at all
the<00:01:31.200> reason<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> my<00:01:32.460> casula<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the reason for this is that my casula is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
the reason for this is that my casula is
already<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:33.630> enough<00:01:33.900> coverage<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.619> don't

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
already a good enough coverage I don't

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
already a good enough coverage I don't
need<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> pile<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.549> foundation<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:36.479> too<00:01:36.720> if

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
need to pile on foundation there too if

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
need to pile on foundation there too if
you<00:01:37.470> layer<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.829> too<00:01:38.220> much<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.939> get

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you layer on too much you can get

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.719 
you layer on too much you can get
precinct<00:01:39.600> under<00:01:39.810> your<00:01:39.930> eyes<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.530> also<00:01:41.280> avoid
