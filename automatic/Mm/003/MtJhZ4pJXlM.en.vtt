okay<00:00:01.260> so<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.100> to

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay so in this video we're going to

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.420 
okay so in this video we're going to
look<00:00:02.250> at<00:00:02.460> adding<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.060> run<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.230> idle<00:00:04.890> sorry

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
look at adding the run and idle sorry

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.849 
look at adding the run and idle sorry
run<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.700> jump<00:00:05.759> animations<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.660> how<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.589> use

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
run and jump animations and how to use

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.250 
run and jump animations and how to use
the<00:00:07.980> animator<00:00:08.400> state<00:00:09.330> machine<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.780> switch

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the animator state machine to switch

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.780 
the animator state machine to switch
between<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.769> transition<00:00:11.490> between<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
between the transition between the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.030 
between the transition between the
animations<00:00:12.240> depending<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.840> conditions<00:00:13.740> like

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
animations depending on conditions like

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.109 
animations depending on conditions like
key<00:00:14.969> prices<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.940> first<00:00:17.940> things

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
key prices and so that so first things

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.060 
key prices and so that so first things
first<00:00:18.180> we're<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> add<00:00:18.720> our<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.439> run

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
first we're going to add our one run

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.210 
first we're going to add our one run
animation<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.590> though<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> take<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> look

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
animation and though if you take a look

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.939 
animation and though if you take a look
at<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> sprite<00:00:23.789> sheet<00:00:24.350> in<00:00:25.350> Ella<00:00:25.500> set<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> run

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
at the sprite sheet in Ella set the run

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.009 
at the sprite sheet in Ella set the run
animation<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.580> sort<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.880> blocked<00:00:27.689> together

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
animation is sort of blocked together

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
animation is sort of blocked together
here<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> left<00:00:28.590> hand<00:00:28.769> side<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
here on the left hand side and so the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.959 
here on the left hand side and so the
number<00:00:30.630> order<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> frames<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
number order of the frames is kind of

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
number order of the frames is kind of
all<00:00:32.969> over<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.329> place<00:00:33.480> because<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
all over the place because it kind of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.830 
all over the place because it kind of
reads<00:00:35.190> line<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.700> line<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.239> adds<00:00:36.420> two<00:00:36.719> numbers

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
reads line by line and adds two numbers

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750 
reads line by line and adds two numbers
line<00:00:37.170> by<00:00:37.320> line<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> jump<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.579> fall

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
line by line so the jump on it to fall

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
line by line so the jump on it to fall
animations<00:00:39.300> kind<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> sandwiched<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.680> between

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
animations kind of sandwiched in between

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.760 
animations kind of sandwiched in between
somewhere<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> run<00:00:42.000> elevation<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.770> I've

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
somewhere and the run elevation so I've

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.240 
somewhere and the run elevation so I've
gone<00:00:43.980> ahead<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.219> counted<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> frames<00:00:46.250> for

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
gone ahead and counted the frames for

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.770 
gone ahead and counted the frames for
the<00:00:48.239> run<00:00:48.539> animation<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> back<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.449> editor

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the run animation so back in the editor

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.610 
the run animation so back in the editor
we'll<00:00:52.649> hit<00:00:53.399> record<00:00:54.000> no<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.289> record

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
we'll hit record no actually not record

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.340 
we'll hit record no actually not record
when<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.949> create<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> new<00:00:56.280> clip<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.350> will

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
when I create a new clip so I will

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.640 
when I create a new clip so I will
create<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.920> clip<00:00:59.100> and<00:01:01.520> we'll<00:01:02.520> call<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:05.450> fast

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
create your clip and we'll call it fast

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.429 
create your clip and we'll call it fast
delete<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:07.830> call<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.760> run<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.140> hit

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
delete that one call it a run and hit

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.140 
delete that one call it a run and hit
save<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.710> we'll<00:01:13.710> hit<00:01:13.770> record<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.430> we'll<00:01:15.030> go

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
save and we'll hit record and we'll go

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.640 
save and we'll hit record and we'll go
ahead<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> draw<00:01:15.840> our<00:01:15.990> frames<00:01:16.229> into<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
ahead and draw our frames into the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.760 
ahead and draw our frames into the
animation<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.189> starts<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.610> frame<00:01:18.210> 24<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
animation it starts at frame 24 so you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.140 
animation it starts at frame 24 so you
might<00:01:19.920> want<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.369> make<00:01:20.670> sure<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.880> when

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
might want to just make sure that when

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.130 
might want to just make sure that when
you're<00:01:21.270> creating<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.689> own<00:01:21.720> character

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
you're creating your own character

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 
you're creating your own character
sheets<00:01:22.380> white<00:01:22.740> sheets<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
sheets white sheets that all of that the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
sheets white sheets that all of that the
animation<00:01:24.450> frames<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.170> animation

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
animation frames for the same animation

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
animation frames for the same animation
or<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.310> same<00:01:26.490> line<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.270> come<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
or on the same line because we come to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.920 
or on the same line because we come to
chapter<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:28.020> than<00:01:28.140> unity<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.880> numbers<00:01:30.720> them

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
chapter there than unity it numbers them

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
chapter there than unity it numbers them
and<00:01:31.170> bait<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> line<00:01:32.189> basis<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.509> be

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and bait on a line basis so just be

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.550 
and bait on a line basis so just be
careful<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.210> 24<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.479> 32<00:01:37.549> well<00:01:38.549> drag<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
careful so 24 to 32 well drag them in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.149 
careful so 24 to 32 well drag them in
the<00:01:40.560> next<00:01:40.829> batch<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.009> 42<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> 50<00:01:45.890> drag<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.040> in

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the next batch is 42 to 50 drag them in

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.380 
the next batch is 42 to 50 drag them in
and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.790> lastly<00:01:48.180> last<00:01:48.540> batch<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.899> 60<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> 68

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
and then lastly last batch is 60 to 68

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.109 
and then lastly last batch is 60 to 68
or<00:01:51.390> we'll<00:01:51.810> drag<00:01:51.930> them<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.290> we're<00:01:52.680> kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.920> just

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
or we'll drag them in we're kind of just

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.929 
or we'll drag them in we're kind of just
making<00:01:54.119> sure<00:01:54.360> they're<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.310> dots<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
making sure they're all the dots all the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.440 
making sure they're all the dots all the
frames<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.799> aligned<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.909> don't<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
frames are aligned so we don't have a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.840 
frames are aligned so we don't have a
longer<00:02:00.840> pauses<00:02:01.049> between<00:02:01.380> frames<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
longer pauses between frames so all the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.819 
longer pauses between frames so all the
frames<00:02:03.060> should<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.329> consistently<00:02:03.930> aligned

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
frames should be consistently aligned

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.340 
frames should be consistently aligned
like<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:06.149> dots<00:02:06.600> here<00:02:06.719> representing

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
like so little dots here representing

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.760 
like so little dots here representing
the<00:02:07.500> time<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> let's<00:02:10.020> press<00:02:10.200> play<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.709> see

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the time so let's press play and see

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.300 
the time so let's press play and see
what<00:02:11.520> happens<00:02:11.819> I'll<00:02:12.000> take<00:02:12.060> off<00:02:12.420> report

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
what happens I'll take off report

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.550 
what happens I'll take off report
there<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.519> running<00:02:16.269> very<00:02:16.720> fast<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.290> if<00:02:17.439> you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
there is running very fast so if you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.250 
there is running very fast so if you
reduce<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.920> sample<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.489> 30<00:02:18.670> again<00:02:22.260> it's

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
reduce the sample to 30 again it's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.880 
reduce the sample to 30 again it's
playing<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.760> more<00:02:24.760> consistently<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:25.890> cool

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
playing it more consistently there cool

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.160 
playing it more consistently there cool
that's<00:02:27.459> great

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that's great

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.630 
that's great
so<00:02:29.170> we<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.379> two<00:02:29.530> animations<00:02:29.859> idle<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.549> run

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
so we have a two animations idle and run

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.569 
so we have a two animations idle and run
you<00:02:30.879> can<00:02:31.000> flip<00:02:31.180> between<00:02:31.269> them<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:33.280> what<00:02:33.459> we're

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
you can flip between them and what we're

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.160 
you can flip between them and what we're
interested<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:34.120> here<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:37.030> second<00:02:37.359> yeah

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
interested in here is that second yeah

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.530 
interested in here is that second yeah
what<00:02:38.739> we're<00:02:38.829> interested<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.310> here<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.760> this

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
what we're interested in here is this

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.720 
what we're interested in here is this
animator<00:02:41.109> window<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:42.069> top<00:02:42.250> here<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.609> it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
animator window to top here and it

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.849 
animator window to top here and it
should<00:02:42.879> open<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.379> tab<00:02:44.590> should<00:02:44.739> be

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
should open and the tab should be

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.349 
should open and the tab should be
available<00:02:45.010> beside<00:02:45.489> you're<00:02:45.639> seeing<00:02:45.879> you<00:02:46.120> and

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
available beside you're seeing you and

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.539 
available beside you're seeing you and
this<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.810> tab<00:02:47.170> will<00:02:47.470> open<00:02:47.500> once<00:02:48.129> you<00:02:48.250> create

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
this this tab will open once you create

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.729 
this this tab will open once you create
an<00:02:48.639> animation<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:49.209> any<00:02:49.329> character<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
an animation for any character and the

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.309 
an animation for any character and the
animator<00:02:51.040> component<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.790> attached<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.060> them

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
animator component is attached to them

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.509 
animator component is attached to them
if<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.440> don't<00:02:53.590> have<00:02:53.680> an<00:02:53.769> animator<00:02:54.069> tab<00:02:54.310> you

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
if you don't have an animator tab you

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.800 
if you don't have an animator tab you
can<00:02:54.609> open<00:02:54.879> it<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.060> window<00:02:55.359> window<00:02:55.750> animator<00:02:57.810> so

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
can open it to window window animator so

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.330 
can open it to window window animator so
here<00:02:59.049> we're<00:02:59.680> presented<00:03:00.069> with<00:03:02.280> let's<00:03:03.280> just

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
here we're presented with let's just

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.069 
here we're presented with let's just
leave<00:03:03.549> that<00:03:03.730> one<00:03:03.819> there<00:03:03.879> we<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.359> idle<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
leave that one there we have idle and

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.270 
leave that one there we have idle and
work<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.500> we've<00:03:05.620> got<00:03:05.739> our<00:03:05.829> two<00:03:05.859> animations

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
work so we've got our two animations

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.789 
work so we've got our two animations
represented<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.180> these<00:03:07.269> boxes<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.500> orange

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
represented in these boxes the orange

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.679 
represented in these boxes the orange
indicates<00:03:09.489> which<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:09.879> the<00:03:09.970> default<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.629> can

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
indicates which is the default you can

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.020 
indicates which is the default you can
change<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.069> click<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.430> any<00:03:12.519> animation

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
change that but I click on any animation

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.939 
change that but I click on any animation
and<00:03:13.269> set<00:03:13.720> its<00:03:13.840> default<00:03:16.470> title<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.680> obviously

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
and set its default title is obviously

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:23.059 
and set its default title is obviously
default<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:19.319> what<00:03:20.319> red<00:03:20.500> chest<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.889> here<00:03:20.919> is<00:03:21.310> a

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
default and what red chest in here is a

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.080 
default and what red chest in here is a
transition<00:03:24.069> it's<00:03:24.400> what<00:03:24.549> called<00:03:24.730> let's<00:03:24.940> call

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
transition it's what called let's call

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.490 
transition it's what called let's call
the<00:03:25.150> transition<00:03:25.599> so<00:03:25.810> if<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.959> right<00:03:26.109> click<00:03:26.139> on

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the transition so if you right click on

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.939 
the transition so if you right click on
idle<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:28.209> can<00:03:28.419> hit<00:03:28.930> mate<00:03:29.139> transition<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.799> then

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
idle we can hit mate transition and then

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.789 
idle we can hit mate transition and then
trying<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.310> another<00:03:31.180> animation<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.810> click<00:03:31.989> so

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
trying to another animation and click so

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.509 
trying to another animation and click so
now<00:03:32.919> that<00:03:32.980> we<00:03:33.879> have<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> transition<00:03:34.480> set<00:03:34.840> up<00:03:35.519> we

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
now that we have a transition set up we

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.300 
now that we have a transition set up we
also<00:03:36.669> make<00:03:36.879> one<00:03:36.909> go<00:03:37.269> back<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.690> idle<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:39.190> what

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
also make one go back to idle so what

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.009 
also make one go back to idle so what
these<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.760> these<00:03:39.909> transition<00:03:40.419> bars<00:03:40.629> are<00:03:40.840> for

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
these of these transition bars are for

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.289 
these of these transition bars are for
are<00:03:41.319> they<00:03:41.889> allow<00:03:42.099> us<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:42.280> set<00:03:42.639> up<00:03:42.669> condition

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
are they allow us to set up condition

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.629 
are they allow us to set up condition
for<00:03:43.989> which<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.949> animation<00:03:45.400> and

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
for which and the animation and

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.259 
for which and the animation and
transition<00:03:46.269> from<00:03:46.870> one<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.199> the<00:03:47.229> other<00:03:47.379> so<00:03:48.269> to

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
transition from one to the other so to

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.140 
transition from one to the other so to
swap<00:03:49.569> from<00:03:49.900> idle<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.290> run<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:51.400> could<00:03:51.639> set<00:03:51.970> that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
swap from idle to run we could set that

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.430 
swap from idle to run we could set that
up<00:03:52.180> depending<00:03:52.780> on<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.959> speed<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.319> the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
up depending on the speed of the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.740 
up depending on the speed of the
character<00:03:53.859> and<00:03:54.040> then<00:03:54.280> vice<00:03:54.549> versa<00:03:54.729> as<00:03:55.030> well<00:03:55.209> it

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
character and then vice versa as well it

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.039 
character and then vice versa as well it
speeds<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.199> character<00:03:56.620> was<00:03:57.069> zero<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:58.060> we<00:03:59.019> can

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
speeds the character was zero and we can

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.869 
speeds the character was zero and we can
go<00:03:59.319> from<00:03:59.500> rolling<00:03:59.859> back<00:03:59.979> to<00:04:00.010> idle<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.549> that

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
go from rolling back to idle and that

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.080 
go from rolling back to idle and that
makes<00:04:01.060> sense<00:04:01.979> so<00:04:02.979> we<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.519> click<00:04:03.669> on<00:04:03.790> these<00:04:03.909> old

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
makes sense so we can click on these old

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.909 
makes sense so we can click on these old
transition<00:04:04.599> bars<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:07.260> they'll<00:04:08.260> open<00:04:08.560> up<00:04:08.709> a

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
transition bars and they'll open up a

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.379 
transition bars and they'll open up a
new<00:04:09.780> inspector<00:04:10.780> window<00:04:12.120> lots<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.239> new

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
new inspector window lots of new

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.270 
new inspector window lots of new
animation<00:04:13.959> windows<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.979> deal<00:04:15.129> with<00:04:17.159> be<00:04:18.159> nice

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
animation windows to deal with be nice

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.069 
animation windows to deal with be nice
have<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.519> second<00:04:18.880> monitor<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.389> maybe<00:04:19.750> pull

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
have a second monitor so you maybe pull

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.740 
have a second monitor so you maybe pull
your<00:04:20.260> animation<00:04:20.680> stuff<00:04:20.889> together<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:22.000> easier

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
your animation stuff together so easier

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.110 
your animation stuff together so easier
in<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.229> better<00:04:23.500> work<00:04:23.710> environments

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
in a better work environments

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.590 
in a better work environments
or<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.260> what<00:04:26.800> we<00:04:26.889> got<00:04:27.100> so<00:04:27.370> okay<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:28.270> we

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
or this is what we got so okay so we

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.909 
or this is what we got so okay so we
have<00:04:28.800> let's<00:04:29.800> start<00:04:30.010> with<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.310> idle<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:31.180> run

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
have let's start with the idle to run

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.560 
have let's start with the idle to run
and<00:04:32.919> you'll<00:04:33.010> notice<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:34.240> don't<00:04:34.419> need<00:04:34.479> to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and you'll notice that you don't need to

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.700 
and you'll notice that you don't need to
worry<00:04:34.720> about<00:04:34.810> any<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.199> options<00:04:35.560> here

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
worry about any of the options here

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.030 
worry about any of the options here
really<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:37.240> haven't<00:04:38.199> come<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.470> an<00:04:38.680> instance

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
really I haven't come to an instance

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.870 
really I haven't come to an instance
where<00:04:39.250> they've<00:04:39.790> been<00:04:39.820> useful<00:04:40.979> but<00:04:41.979> what

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
where they've been useful but what

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.920 
where they've been useful but what
you're<00:04:43.000> interested<00:04:43.479> in<00:04:43.570> really<00:04:43.750> is

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
you're interested in really is

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.590 
you're interested in really is
conditions<00:04:44.560> box<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.160> state<00:04:46.000> by<00:04:46.120> defaults

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
conditions box and state by defaults

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.219 
conditions box and state by defaults
it's<00:04:46.780> set<00:04:46.990> up<00:04:47.020> set<00:04:47.350> up<00:04:48.900> just<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.020> we<00:04:50.110> can

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
it's set up set up just so we can

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.650 
it's set up set up just so we can
quickly<00:04:50.530> test<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.250> see<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.490> at<00:04:51.610> work<00:04:51.820> we've

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
quickly test and see it at work we've

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.270 
quickly test and see it at work we've
got<00:04:52.810> an<00:04:52.900> exit<00:04:53.260> time<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.530> one<00:04:53.680> second

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
got an exit time of one second

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.000 
got an exit time of one second
so<00:04:54.630> after<00:04:55.630> one<00:04:55.780> second<00:04:56.260> it's<00:04:56.740> going<00:04:56.949> to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
so after one second it's going to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.430 
so after one second it's going to
transition<00:04:57.310> from<00:04:57.490> idle<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.030> run<00:04:58.440> because

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
transition from idle to run because

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.780 
transition from idle to run because
that's<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.740> condition<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.340> transition

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
that's the condition of the transition

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.170 
that's the condition of the transition
same<00:05:01.780> for<00:05:02.050> run<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.620> idle<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.010> X<00:05:03.610> time<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.030> set

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
same for run to idle and X time is set

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.490 
same for run to idle and X time is set
to<00:05:04.270> warn<00:05:04.479> or<00:05:04.660> we're<00:05:04.810> going<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.020> remove<00:05:05.260> those

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
to warn or we're going to remove those

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.590 
to warn or we're going to remove those
but<00:05:06.250> we<00:05:06.490> just<00:05:06.669> want<00:05:06.790> to<00:05:06.880> test<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.270> now<00:05:07.360> we<00:05:07.479> can

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
but we just want to test it now we can

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.440 
but we just want to test it now we can
test<00:05:07.810> very<00:05:08.080> quickly<00:05:08.260> by<00:05:08.470> present<00:05:08.800> play<00:05:09.450> you'll

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
test very quickly by present play you'll

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.290 
test very quickly by present play you'll
see<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:10.840> Tim<00:05:11.169> goes<00:05:12.010> between<00:05:12.250> his<00:05:12.610> idle<00:05:13.120> and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
see that Tim goes between his idle and

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.790 
see that Tim goes between his idle and
run<00:05:13.450> you<00:05:13.810> can<00:05:13.930> see<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.110> blue<00:05:14.260> bar<00:05:14.440> that's<00:05:14.710> the

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
run you can see the blue bar that's the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.110 
run you can see the blue bar that's the
timer<00:05:15.040> the<00:05:15.790> 1<00:05:15.940> second<00:05:16.389> exit<00:05:16.720> timer<00:05:18.120> just

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
timer the 1 second exit timer just

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.820 
timer the 1 second exit timer just
literally<00:05:19.479> transitions<00:05:20.229> back<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.620> forth

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
literally transitions back and forth

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.029 
literally transitions back and forth
between<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.190> two<00:05:21.310> animations<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:23.110> that's

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
between the two animations and that's

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.490 
between the two animations and that's
not<00:05:24.130> working<00:05:24.490> that's<00:05:24.610> great

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
not working that's great

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.860 
not working that's great
so<00:05:26.500> we<00:05:26.590> can<00:05:26.710> take<00:05:26.889> payroll<00:05:27.280> off<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.870> what

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
so we can take payroll off and what

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.840 
so we can take payroll off and what
we're<00:05:28.960> going<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.110> do<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.380> we're<00:05:29.560> going<00:05:29.680> to

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.250 
we're going to do is we're going to
remove<00:05:30.850> two<00:05:30.910> conditions<00:05:31.510> because<00:05:31.810> we<00:05:31.930> could

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
remove two conditions because we could

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.930 
remove two conditions because we could
see<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.500> they're<00:05:32.650> working<00:05:32.800> we<00:05:33.550> can<00:05:33.729> remove

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
see that they're working we can remove

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.710 
see that they're working we can remove
these<00:05:35.520> X<00:05:36.520> time<00:05:36.820> conditions<00:05:37.210> this<00:05:37.389> click<00:05:37.600> at

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
these X time conditions this click at

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.210 
these X time conditions this click at
the<00:05:37.810> start<00:05:38.110> of<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.260> line<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.650> hit<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.919> minus

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
the start of the line and hit the minus

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.629 
the start of the line and hit the minus
button<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:40.330> remove<00:05:41.639> let's<00:05:42.639> get<00:05:42.789> rid<00:05:42.910> of<00:05:42.940> them

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
button to remove let's get rid of them

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.710 
button to remove let's get rid of them
so<00:05:45.639> what<00:05:45.760> we<00:05:45.849> actually<00:05:46.150> want<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.330> do<00:05:46.479> is<00:05:46.599> we

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
so what we actually want to do is we

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.350 
so what we actually want to do is we
want<00:05:46.870> to<00:05:46.930> set<00:05:47.110> up<00:05:47.139> a<00:05:47.410> condition<00:05:47.950> for<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:49.060> speed

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
want to set up a condition for the speed

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.730 
want to set up a condition for the speed
of<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.660> character<00:05:50.020> so<00:05:50.169> when<00:05:50.289> the<00:05:50.380> speed<00:05:50.620> of

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
of the character so when the speed of

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.940 
of the character so when the speed of
the<00:05:50.830> character<00:05:51.190> is<00:05:51.310> over<00:05:51.660> maybe<00:05:52.660> 0.1<00:05:53.260> so<00:05:53.560> you

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
the character is over maybe 0.1 so you

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.830 
the character is over maybe 0.1 so you
know<00:05:54.070> you<00:05:54.430> know<00:05:54.550> something<00:05:54.849> very<00:05:55.030> low<00:05:55.210> so<00:05:55.810> that

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
know you know something very low so that

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.719 
know you know something very low so that
when<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.229> character<00:05:56.530> starts<00:05:56.770> moving<00:05:57.130> he

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
when the character starts moving he

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.550 
when the character starts moving he
transitions<00:05:58.240> to<00:05:58.479> run<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.930> then<00:05:59.229> when<00:05:59.440> the

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
transitions to run and then when the

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.800 
transitions to run and then when the
character<00:05:59.889> stops<00:06:00.160> moving<00:06:00.419> when<00:06:01.419> the<00:06:01.510> speed<00:06:01.780> is

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
character stops moving when the speed is

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.839 
character stops moving when the speed is
zero<00:06:02.169> it<00:06:02.440> converts<00:06:02.889> back<00:06:03.099> to<00:06:03.310> idle<00:06:05.669> so<00:06:06.669> let's

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
zero it converts back to idle so let's

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.310 
zero it converts back to idle so let's
say<00:06:07.030> look<00:06:07.330> at<00:06:07.450> this<00:06:07.539> little<00:06:07.720> parameter<00:06:08.169> window

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
say look at this little parameter window

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.670 
say look at this little parameter window
here<00:06:09.539> again<00:06:10.539> this<00:06:10.660> is<00:06:10.780> this<00:06:11.020> is<00:06:11.169> new<00:06:11.349> and<00:06:11.590> you

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
here again this is this is new and you

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.070 
here again this is this is new and you
think<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:12.280> the<00:06:12.430> animator<00:06:12.940> window<00:06:13.030> if<00:06:13.450> you

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
think to the animator window if you

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.510 
think to the animator window if you
click<00:06:14.260> on<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.620> plus<00:06:14.979> symbol<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.310> add<00:06:15.460> a

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
click on the plus symbol to add a
