another day or two then I think we would
have<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.439> really<00:01:50.310> good<00:01:50.460> chance<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:51.090> seeing<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
have a really good chance of seeing that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.469 
have a really good chance of seeing that
72<00:01:52.560> game<00:01:52.799> season<00:01:53.220> starting<00:01:53.700> December<00:01:54.060> 15th

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
72 game season starting December 15th

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.230 
72 game season starting December 15th
because<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.799> Union<00:01:56.280> has<00:01:56.460> its<00:01:56.729> druthers

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
because if the Union has its druthers

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.109 
because if the Union has its druthers
that<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.869> will<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> league<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.640> be

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that they will go to the league and be

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
that they will go to the league and be
able<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.420> negotiate<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.409> another<00:02:01.740> day<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.250> two

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
able to negotiate for another day or two

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.880 
able to negotiate for another day or two
maybe<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> few<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.540> changes<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
maybe get a few more changes to this

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.190 
maybe get a few more changes to this
proposal<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.869> could<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
proposal and then I think we could see a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.059 
proposal and then I think we could see a
deal<00:02:07.500> done

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
deal done

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.129 
deal done
