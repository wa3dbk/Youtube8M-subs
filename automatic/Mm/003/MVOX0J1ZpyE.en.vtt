00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 Such plastic he very effectively 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.129
 looks but you know and very easy for 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.689
 bloopers of faces from fingers on the left side 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.470
 headphones have such a small 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.960
 control panel which is 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.430
 switching songs or rewind 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.750

 here you can also build the volume and 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:30.630
 turning on the bottom headphones have a connector 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.610
 micro usb for charging via computer 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.540

 charged 12 volts and here also 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.320
 there is an indicator 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.220
 This indicator is burning heads and turn on 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.500
 when they charge and like this and now 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 I would like to show you this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.149
 hell sound when you turn on the radius 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.799
 actions of such headphones up to 10 meters and 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.259
 with this headset 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.520
 you can not take the phone out of the bag 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.320
 to answer the call 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.090
 and also listen to internet radio 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 different rooms completely calm 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.550
 headphones are lightweight they are all 130 grams and on 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.990
 head sit pretty nice here 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.550
 there is an adjustable headband you with 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.690
 You can easily find a convenient for 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.540
 you position but I want to tell you that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.270
 Basically they are comfortable 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.500
 they heat very much and now these 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.670
 warm lining and i want to say that here 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.860
 this is an arc it is a little bit watery 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.350
 after probably an hour of use already 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.260
 slowly starts to hurt it this 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.220
 disadvantage guys as for 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.760
 autonomy 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 the information here is quite a bit I know 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.700
 what is it worth those new battery and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.430
 grabs her up to ten hours of use 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.390
 in principle it is quite 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.370
 what is enough for me to watch them 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.140
 89 exactly good use 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.280
 they charge an average of two hours with 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.650
 half three 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.920
 convenient indicator which are on 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.100
 bottom of the headphones help for example 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.620
 understand that your headphones are charging 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.799
 for example when connected to a computer 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.910
 they light up red and at full 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.850
 charging are blue 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.709
 it means that you can already 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.260
 charge off and fully 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.320
 use a nice little thing but 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.170
 connecting headphones to the decay near 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.120
 bluetooth icon shows small 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.299
 battery that displays charge 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.140
 The battery in these headphones is small but 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.850
 nice so let's make a conclusion these 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.430
 I bought headphones a month ago 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.519
 for 1100 rubles and stayed completely 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.579
 pleased with them great sound low 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.880
 frequencies 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:06.030
 quite a long autonomy work and 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.030
 great view i would say yes excellent view
