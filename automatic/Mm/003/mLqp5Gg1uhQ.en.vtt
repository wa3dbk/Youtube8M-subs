00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
do this in the sink but today I'm going

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
do this in the sink but today I'm going
to<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.130> pour<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to do it so you can see just pour the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.429 
to do it so you can see just pour the
water<00:01:15.450> right<00:01:16.110> into<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.310> hole<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
water right into the hole here so that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440 
water right into the hole here so that
you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> wash<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.100> greens<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.610> sometimes

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you can wash your greens and sometimes

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
you can wash your greens and sometimes
if<00:01:21.630> they're<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.350> dirty<00:01:22.590> fill<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
if they're really really dirty fill it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.999 
if they're really really dirty fill it
up<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> way<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.380> let<00:01:25.380> them<00:01:25.500> soak<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> bit

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
up all the way and let them soak a bit

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.120 
up all the way and let them soak a bit
and<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:27.000> wash<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.259> rinse<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.650> again

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.090 

so<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.790> we're<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.770> turn<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so then we're just going to turn this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.940 
so then we're just going to turn this
and<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.329> water<00:01:36.950> interacting

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and you can see the water interacting

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.030 
and you can see the water interacting
with<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.250> greens

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
with the greens

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.700 
with the greens
and<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.719> actually<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> washing

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and then so this is actually the washing

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.760 
and then so this is actually the washing
action<00:01:44.719> and<00:01:45.719> then<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.590> do

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
