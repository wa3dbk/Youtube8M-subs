on the Galaxy Note 3 it's a feature that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
we've seen done in the lg optimus G pro
admittedly<00:01:15.869> though<00:01:16.439> Samsung<00:01:16.890> took<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> bit

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
admittedly though Samsung took it a bit

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.310 
admittedly though Samsung took it a bit
further<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:18.000> adding<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.509> scalable<00:01:18.810> apps<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
further by adding more scalable apps and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.740 
further by adding more scalable apps and
elements<00:01:19.759> but<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> know<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.390> didn't

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
elements but you know what they didn't

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
elements but you know what they didn't
stop<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.259> no<00:01:22.799> Samsung<00:01:23.280> went<00:01:23.460> even<00:01:23.610> further

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
stop there no Samsung went even further

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.539 
stop there no Samsung went even further
by<00:01:24.150> adding<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.630> top<00:01:24.900> option<00:01:25.380> yes<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.369> read

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
by adding this top option yes you read

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
by adding this top option yes you read
