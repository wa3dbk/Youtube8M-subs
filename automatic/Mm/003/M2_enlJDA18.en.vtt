 and thus allows a considerable gain in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.759
 products and manpower 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.660
 in the concrete example that we are going 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.820
 show you you will be able to 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.220
 visualize the renovation process and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.010
 smoothing a wall with a relief 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.780
 in droplets with the final result 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.470
 obtaining a perfect surface 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.910
 smooth prior actions to achieve 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.630
 check the consistency and hardness of the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:58.990
 support perform the grid test 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.990
 apply the product 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.460
 to do this we will use the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.700
 following tools a cutter a blade 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.500
 induce a drip roll a 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.360
 reading a sander checking of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.459
 the state of the support so check 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.610
 the condition of the support to renovate is appropriate 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.459
 to perform different tests tests 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.720
 sound data with small point 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.340
 shots in different places of the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.310
 piece in order to locate the parts 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.230
 sick and ray or take off a hollow sound 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.269
 will allow to locate the zones 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.000
 weakened that will have to be previously 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.850
 sanitized and treated before applying 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.820
 the coating of renovation test of the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.830
 grid to check the good 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.140
 support cohesion 1.6 and with a 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.870
 cutter by drawing a grid of 1 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.209
 cm on 20 cm then scratch this 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.250
 grid with a coating knife 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.830
 scraping the surface if we notice 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.260
 at least 75% of this area remains 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.850
 intact that means that the support and 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.850
 well cohesive and well adhere 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.099
 if on the contrary this surface tears 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.709
 easily this indicates that support 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.689
 is weakened and lacks cohesion in 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.760
 this case a specific treatment will be 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.400
 necessary to repair and clean up 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.659
 funds before renovating them to get 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.939
 the necessary information 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.450
 consult our technical service where 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:32.930
 our distributor application of the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.180
 produced using the humidified roll of

 type anti drops with short hair 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.499
 stir and knead 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.299
 product that comes in ready-made dough 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.799
 to use in order to make it well 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.540
 homogeneous 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.250
 then impregnated the roll into the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.739
 loading with dough in abundance 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.540
 then put the coating on the wall 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.489
 garnish and distribute a quantity of 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.949
 sufficient products according to the thickness 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.969
 necessary depending on the relief of the 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:00.819
 support after depositing quantity 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.530
 of necessary products on the support 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.230
 worked by no maximum score 2 meters 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.590
 squares by smoothing the product with the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.419
 blade smear at the smoother do not 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.829
 apply by stub of more than 2 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.909
 square meters to prevent the 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.799
 product does not dry 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.070
 which would complicate the operation of 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.070
 smooth 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.280
 after finalizing this operation 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.690
 let the product dry for 24 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.970
 hours after complete drying of the product 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.950
 used a blade smear to eliminate 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.950
 the extra thickness and possible defects 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.740
 we recommend applying a 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.140
 second street layer alex plus confort 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.660
 2 in 1 thinner to get a 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.780
 Extra fine and high quality result 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.730
 applied first layer 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.920
 to level the relief of the surface 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.660
 this second finishing layer more 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.250
 fine will get a result 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.250
 final smooth and perfect 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.580
 after complete drying we know if 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.280
 necessary the entire surface in 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.830
 using an extra-fine grain abrasive 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.080
 220 kiprÃ© will arrange the walls to be 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.630
 covered in finish with paints
