00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
gaskets that are on this motor so that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.550 
gaskets that are on this motor so that
way<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.030> get<00:01:05.180> on<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:05.720> ride<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.110> real<00:01:06.350> hard

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
way you get on it you ride it real hard

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.440 
way you get on it you ride it real hard
you<00:01:06.830> know<00:01:06.920> when<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.100> first<00:01:07.280> get<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.670> those

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
you know when you first get it those

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.240 
you know when you first get it those
gaskets<00:01:08.689> aren't<00:01:09.140> heat<00:01:09.290> sealed<00:01:09.590> yet<00:01:09.979> and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
gaskets aren't heat sealed yet and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.010 
gaskets aren't heat sealed yet and
they're<00:01:10.340> not<00:01:10.430> bonded<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.090> motor<00:01:11.300> it<00:01:11.840> can

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
they're not bonded to the motor it can

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.510 
they're not bonded to the motor it can
cause<00:01:12.170> those<00:01:12.380> guys<00:01:12.410> cuts<00:01:12.800> to<00:01:12.920> crack<00:01:13.190> and

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
cause those guys cuts to crack and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.370 
cause those guys cuts to crack and
essentially<00:01:14.120> you<00:01:14.360> know<00:01:14.480> cause<00:01:14.840> an<00:01:15.200> oil

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
essentially you know cause an oil

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.020 
essentially you know cause an oil
problem<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.010> know<00:01:16.100> for<00:01:16.310> leaking<00:01:16.610> outside

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
problem you know for leaking outside

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.060 
problem you know for leaking outside
your<00:01:17.210> motor<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:17.930> make<00:01:18.080> sure<00:01:18.230> for<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.590> first<00:01:18.770> 20

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
your motor so make sure for the first 20

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.730 
your motor so make sure for the first 20
minutes<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.670> go<00:01:19.820> ahead<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.480> let<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:21.620> sit

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
minutes you go ahead and let it just sit

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.290 
minutes you go ahead and let it just sit
make<00:01:22.370> sure<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:22.700> know<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:22.880> doesn't<00:01:23.000> overheat

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
make sure you know it doesn't overheat

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.570 
make sure you know it doesn't overheat
and<00:01:23.570> whatnot<00:01:23.900> just<00:01:24.170> let<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:24.860> sit<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.400> heat

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
and whatnot just let it sit so it heat

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.670 
and whatnot just let it sit so it heat
cycles<00:01:26.000> motor<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.510> then<00:01:26.960> after<00:01:27.260> that<00:01:27.380> go

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
cycles motor and then after that go

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.590 
cycles motor and then after that go
ahead<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.040> drain<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.610> oil<00:01:28.640> you're<00:01:29.480> gonna

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
ahead and drain the oil you're gonna

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.620

want<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.840> put<00:01:30.080> 10<00:01:30.650> W<00:01:30.920> 47<00:01:31.610> semi-synthetic<00:01:32.150> or

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
want to put 10 W 47 semi-synthetic or

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.140 
want to put 10 W 47 semi-synthetic or
non-static<00:01:33.290> oil<00:01:33.530> don't<00:01:33.860> put<00:01:34.040> any<00:01:34.190> you<00:01:35.030> know

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
non-static oil don't put any you know

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.030 
non-static oil don't put any you know
pure<00:01:35.810> synthetic<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.470> there<00:01:36.590> because<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.920> has

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
pure synthetic in there because it has

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.470 
pure synthetic in there because it has
additives<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.580> can<00:01:37.790> actually<00:01:37.940> eat<00:01:38.270> those

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
additives that can actually eat those

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.320 
additives that can actually eat those
gaskets<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.170> cause<00:01:39.590> oily<00:01:40.130> problems<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.180> make

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
gaskets and cause oily problems so make

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.240 
gaskets and cause oily problems so make
sure<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.570> do<00:01:41.690> change<00:01:41.930> oil<00:01:42.230> after<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.040> first

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
sure you do change oil after that first

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.550 
sure you do change oil after that first
20<00:01:43.490> minute<00:01:43.670> period<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.420> after<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.870> go<00:01:45.320> ahead

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
20 minute period and after you go ahead

20 minute period and after you go ahead
and<00:01:45.740> run<00:01:46.270> probably<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.540> 50<00:01:48.290> miles<00:01:48.500> on<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:48.950> is

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
and run probably about 50 miles on it is

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.620 
and run probably about 50 miles on it is
the<00:01:49.159> first<00:01:49.430> time<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.150> want<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.330> change<00:01:50.510> the

oil and then at 250 500 then every
thousand<00:01:54.560> at<00:01:54.650> that<00:01:54.800> point

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
thousand at that point

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.649 
thousand at that point
some<00:01:56.320> people<00:01:56.590> like<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.860> at<00:01:57.040> 500<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:58.180> you

shop and tell them $1,000 you need the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.340 
shop and tell them $1,000 you need the
valves<00:02:37.000> done<00:02:37.209> what<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.870> happen<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.319> the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
valves done what can happen is the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.080 
valves done what can happen is the
valves<00:02:38.709> get<00:02:38.860> too<00:02:39.040> tight<00:02:39.310> at<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.550> thousand<00:02:39.940> miles

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
valves get too tight at a thousand miles

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.180 
valves get too tight at a thousand miles
and<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.380> basically<00:02:41.530> adjust<00:02:41.769> them

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
back to where they're at and then you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.630 
back to where they're at and then you

you remember that and that's a little

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.730 
you remember that and that's a little
some<00:05:20.270> of<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.420> 150s<00:05:20.900> but<00:05:21.170> all<00:05:21.290> that<00:05:21.410> most<00:05:21.650> of

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
some of the 150s but all that most of

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.700 
some of the 150s but all that most of
the<00:05:21.800> two<00:05:21.950> fifties<00:05:22.310> do<00:05:22.850> have<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.350> option<00:05:24.350> so

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
the two fifties do have that option so

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.710 
the two fifties do have that option so
make<00:05:24.890> sure<00:05:24.920> you<00:05:25.160> keep<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.460> in<00:05:25.910> mind<00:05:26.510> whenever

vehicle when you first get the unit and
actually<00:05:32.540> doing<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.840> little<00:05:32.960> changes<00:05:33.320> every

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
actually doing the little changes every

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.810 
actually doing the little changes every
once<00:05:33.740> a<00:05:33.830> while<00:05:33.860> make<00:05:34.340> sure<00:05:34.460> your<00:05:34.580> tire

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
once a while make sure your tire

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.880 
once a while make sure your tire
pressure<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:35.330> correct<00:05:35.750> if<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.350> have<00:05:36.590> low

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
pressure is correct if you have low

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.380 
pressure is correct if you have low
pressure<00:05:37.100> in<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.370> front<00:05:37.670> you<00:05:38.120> know<00:05:38.150> high

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
pressure in the front you know high

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.180

pressure<00:05:38.690> in<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.870> rear<00:05:39.110> then<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:39.920> can<00:05:40.040> cause

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
pressure in the rear then it can cause

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.340 
pressure in the rear then it can cause
your<00:05:40.430> scooter<00:05:40.760> to<00:05:40.880> wobble<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.480> can<00:05:41.630> cause<00:05:41.870> and

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
your scooter to wobble it can cause and

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.700 
your scooter to wobble it can cause and
miles<00:05:42.740> per<00:05:43.010> gallon<00:05:43.370> to<00:05:43.430> go<00:05:43.550> down<00:05:44.410> and<00:05:45.410> it<00:05:45.590> can

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
miles per gallon to go down and it can

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.160 
miles per gallon to go down and it can
cause<00:05:45.890> to<00:05:46.070> be<00:05:46.190> unsafe<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:46.850> make<00:05:47.030> sure<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:47.630> read

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
cause to be unsafe so make sure you read

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.510 
cause to be unsafe so make sure you read
the<00:05:48.290> side<00:05:48.530> of<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.680> tire<00:05:48.890> on<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.340> tire

the side of the tire on the tire
pressure<00:05:49.850> make<00:05:50.420> sure<00:05:50.570> how<00:05:50.660> does<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:50.810> correct

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
pressure make sure how does a correct

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.870 
pressure make sure how does a correct
tire<00:05:51.320> pressure<00:05:51.350> that<00:05:52.220> way<00:05:52.370> you're<00:05:52.580> getting<00:05:52.670> a

actually bolts you know I would suggest
using<00:06:19.770> blue<00:06:20.099> loctite<00:06:20.370> on<00:06:20.699> these<00:06:20.849> just<00:06:21.060> because

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
using blue loctite on these just because

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.029 
using blue loctite on these just because
even<00:06:21.599> though<00:06:21.659> they<00:06:21.779> have<00:06:21.930> Locker<00:06:22.229> nuts<00:06:22.560> you

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
even though they have Locker nuts you

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.589 
even though they have Locker nuts you
know<00:06:23.159> there's<00:06:23.430> always<00:06:23.759> a<00:06:23.879> chance<00:06:23.969> that<00:06:24.449> those

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
know there's always a chance that those

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.469 
know there's always a chance that those
things<00:06:24.870> can<00:06:25.169> spin<00:06:25.860> off<00:06:26.009> so<00:06:26.370> it's<00:06:27.120> a<00:06:27.180> small

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
things can spin off so it's a small

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:28.610 
things can spin off so it's a small
chance<00:06:27.749> but<00:06:27.870> you<00:06:28.169> know<00:06:28.259> if<00:06:28.319> you<00:06:28.379> want<00:06:28.499> to<00:06:28.560> be

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
chance but you know if you want to be

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.899 
chance but you know if you want to be
