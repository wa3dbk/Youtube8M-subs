it has an 2300 milliampere battery and
let's<00:05:50.050> move<00:05:50.319> the<00:05:50.560> device<00:05:50.949> before<00:05:51.849> booting<00:05:52.270> the

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
let's move the device before booting the

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.749 
let's move the device before booting the
device<00:05:52.659> let's<00:05:53.050> check<00:05:53.620> how<00:05:54.159> to<00:05:54.219> insert<00:05:54.639> this

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
device let's check how to insert this

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.360 
device let's check how to insert this
SIM<00:05:55.000> card<00:05:55.270> inside<00:05:55.389> it<00:05:55.719> so<00:05:56.289> let's<00:05:56.830> take<00:05:57.009> these

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
SIM card inside it so let's take these

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.629 
SIM card inside it so let's take these
silicon<00:05:57.819> is<00:05:57.969> going<00:05:58.240> to<00:05:58.449> to<00:05:58.509> us<00:05:58.949> yeah<00:05:59.949> here<00:06:00.580> I

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
silicon is going to to us yeah here I

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.860 
silicon is going to to us yeah here I
got<00:06:00.909> that<00:06:02.279> so<00:06:03.279> we<00:06:03.939> can<00:06:04.089> remove<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.419> suggesting

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
got that so we can remove the suggesting

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.110 
got that so we can remove the suggesting
card<00:06:05.169> tray<00:06:05.379> by<00:06:05.710> putting<00:06:06.370> this<00:06:06.639> SIM<00:06:06.849> card

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
card tray by putting this SIM card

card tray by putting this SIM card
removal<00:06:07.330> tool<00:06:08.169> into<00:06:08.589> the<00:06:08.620> hole<00:06:09.210> there's<00:06:10.210> a

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
removal tool into the hole there's a

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.839 
removal tool into the hole there's a
small<00:06:10.539> tiny<00:06:10.750> hole<00:06:11.080> here<00:06:11.289> just<00:06:11.979> put<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.460> inside

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
small tiny hole here just put it inside

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.839 
small tiny hole here just put it inside
and<00:06:13.150> press<00:06:13.479> it<00:06:13.719> it<00:06:14.409> will<00:06:14.469> pop<00:06:15.099> up<00:06:15.159> this<00:06:15.460> in<00:06:15.639> cut

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
and press it it will pop up this in cut

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.829 
and press it it will pop up this in cut
tray<00:06:16.349> yeah<00:06:17.349> here<00:06:17.889> we<00:06:17.919> can<00:06:18.219> see<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:18.599> both<00:06:19.599> the

tray yeah here we can see that both the

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.100 
tray yeah here we can see that both the
SIM<00:06:20.169> card<00:06:20.199> goes<00:06:21.129> into<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.520> same<00:06:21.879> tray<00:06:22.240> that<00:06:22.870> is

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
SIM card goes into the same tray that is

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.920 
SIM card goes into the same tray that is
one<00:06:23.800> SIM<00:06:24.009> card<00:06:24.250> goes<00:06:24.310> on<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.300> first<00:06:25.539> floor<00:06:25.779> and

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
the second goes in second slot and one

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.779 
the second goes in second slot and one
of<00:06:28.599> this<00:06:28.810> can<00:06:29.050> be<00:06:29.229> supported<00:06:29.770> 4G<00:06:30.250> and<00:06:30.339> 3G<00:06:30.370> and

in<00:06:54.289> the<00:06:54.379> future<00:06:54.969> here<00:06:55.969> it<00:06:56.089> says<00:06:56.330> let<00:06:56.689> go<00:06:56.870> for

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 
in the future here it says let go for

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.719 
in the future here it says let go for
those<00:06:57.409> who<00:06:57.620> do<00:06:57.830> and<00:07:00.309> that's<00:07:01.309> it<00:07:01.550> in<00:07:01.699> the

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
those who do and that's it in the

those who do and that's it in the
overrule<00:07:02.569> Department<00:07:03.580> my<00:07:04.580> first<00:07:04.819> impression

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
overrule Department my first impression

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.450 
overrule Department my first impression
was<00:07:05.419> that<00:07:05.479> it<00:07:05.689> feels<00:07:06.289> very<00:07:06.589> similar<00:07:07.129> to<00:07:07.370> the

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
was that it feels very similar to the

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.899 
was that it feels very similar to the
iPhone<00:07:07.580> 6<00:07:07.819> first<00:07:08.360> of<00:07:08.569> all<00:07:08.749> and<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:10.550> Tom

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:10.909 
iPhone 6 first of all and the Tom

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.179 
iPhone 6 first of all and the Tom
Department<00:07:11.479> only<00:07:11.899> it<00:07:12.110> has<00:07:12.259> a<00:07:12.289> plastic<00:07:12.680> over

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:13.189 
Department only it has a plastic over

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.519 
Department only it has a plastic over
here<00:07:13.430> I<00:07:13.669> think<00:07:14.059> it<00:07:14.449> would<00:07:14.599> be<00:07:14.719> mostly<00:07:15.050> for<00:07:15.349> the

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:15.529 
here I think it would be mostly for the

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:17.889 
here I think it would be mostly for the
antenna<00:07:15.979> reception<00:07:16.460> problems<00:07:16.699> that<00:07:17.479> the<00:07:17.659> most

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:17.899 
antenna reception problems that the most

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:19.570 
antenna reception problems that the most
of<00:07:18.020> the<00:07:18.110> unimodal<00:07:18.469> but<00:07:18.710> that<00:07:18.830> phone<00:07:19.009> has<00:07:19.219> so

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
of the unimodal but that phone has so

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.089 
of the unimodal but that phone has so
here<00:07:19.729> the<00:07:19.879> device<00:07:20.180> is<00:07:20.389> booting<00:07:20.809> so<00:07:21.469> that's<00:07:21.919> it

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:22.099 
here the device is booting so that's it

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.700 
here the device is booting so that's it
in<00:07:22.189> the<00:07:22.249> video<00:07:22.599> as<00:07:23.599> this<00:07:23.870> phone<00:07:24.080> comes<00:07:24.379> with<00:07:24.439> an
