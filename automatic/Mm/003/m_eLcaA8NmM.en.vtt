 they were called without win bar already 32 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:21.070
 it's worth once you have this 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.930
 I opened it and it gives ya víctor point is that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.800
 nothing and the mission editor will come out 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 ok there are some dates to bolivia but no 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.450
 I have time to download it to sound and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.510
 I will also leave in the description of 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.900
 video the mission pack 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.170
 ok here I have a handful of missions 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.740
 all these are japanese 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.680
 and I have the missions are 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 europe that are here 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310
 OK 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.270
 I'll leave you two and you download 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.700
 the ones you want 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.520
 and meteis 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.380
 It's as simple as taking a 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.270
 japanese 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:26.930
 the last house lillo the catch the harrow 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.460
 to the editor and he puts it 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.140
 OK later 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.290
 Let's go slowly now in the edition 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.060
 in the emission that you have solido you give to 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.130
 edit 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.370
 what is the age 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.520
 and here you can edit the mission to your 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.520
 taste 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.810
 is for example you have to kill a 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.290
 fatality clinton 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.670
 I do not know if I do not know what fatality 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.030
 the last case mess to do it 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.150
 armor also seems 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.200
 and here you can imitate everything that gives 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.600
 in this case 257 thousand 905 but good this 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.940
 you can see it 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.660
 OK 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.430
 up here to bring up the preview 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.430
 to be able to edit this to our liking 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.790
 the header here you can modify it in the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.650
 awards things nothing if the objectives the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.690
 monsters that are going to come out you can add 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.970
 more monsters 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.680
 depending on the attack the life to the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.040
 defense and so on 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.550
 OK 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.350
 Here you can see what 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.540
 what's in the box 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.570
 of the mission when you start the mission 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.360
 what there is to give you everything is in 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.910
 English but it's very intuitive here what 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.270
 after all 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.190
 at the end of the mission it is worth 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.750
 you can edit it to your liking 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.750
 example is that you have 5% 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.870
 you can put it in 99 let's say and 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.790
 probability 99 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.850
 to your liking 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.290
 ok let's go to a simpler mission not 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.440
 I going to keep it 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.570
 He had eliminated why not 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.310
 it's worth this mission I edited him 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.350
 especially from scratch almost and good 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.700
 to make your own mission you have 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.700
 what to give to new cast 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.000
 although this is better now for 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.830
 to download it to be able to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.380
 download the mission 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:54.320
 so you have to go to yours after s 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.009
 the internet settings that are 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.770
 adjusts 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.129
 then it gives you the internet connection 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.409
 you need is to have william the on 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.509
 go to the connection that you have with this 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.599
 engine people to download missions 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.320
 in my case to bolt connection one gives you already 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.480
 connection one 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.020
 it gives you to modify settings 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.810
 he gives the little arrow to this one 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.389
 and here it is already served but if in the 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.699
 server but it does indicate jce 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.860
 forgotten settings but yes yes they are 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.340
 it does not give them since if you give 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.919
 advanced 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.090
 here you give click will be blank 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.070
 and team 0 you give forgotten but if 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.400
 you put the address the editor's cau 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.990
 in this case 172 point 26 points 21 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.040
 points 193 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.710
 here I have it 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.540
 then you give the port and change by 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.160
 this number 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.170
 8,084.00 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.230
 and you have everything ready to download 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.780
 admission 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.910
 once you have everything planned you 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.040
 you can be but yes 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.870
 to say the same thing it detects and gives it already 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.150
 allows access 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:14.249
 that it was a fictitious proxy server 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.969
 and you only have to turn on your 3ds 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:20.309
 access the mission forgiveness access to 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.339
 download section will take a while in 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:25.320
 start the event and download the 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:27.600
 emission you want 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.520
 It is very simple and once 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.960
 downloaded depends on how you are 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.910
 configured if you have it 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.910
 haji rain or war 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.580
 for example, you are on a star day 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.160
 OK 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:47.750
 from seven stars 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:52.600
 is from 1 to 2 to 3 and forgiveness by day 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:55.390
 odd idea worth it is very simple boy 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.310
 I hope you know how to do it any 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:01.139
 doubt you leave me in comment 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.440
 this is the mission of 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:07.700
 of an amulet's fist 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:10.450
 worth 150 amulets and good only to all and
