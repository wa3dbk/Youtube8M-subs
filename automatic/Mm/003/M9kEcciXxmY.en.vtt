00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
hi this is julie with beadaholique.com i

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.640 
hi this is julie with beadaholique.com i
beating<00:00:29.060> chained<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.600> that<00:00:30.260> is<00:00:30.350> what<00:00:30.530> i've

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
beating chained and that is what i've

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.770 
beating chained and that is what i've
done<00:00:30.800> here<00:00:31.370> with<00:00:31.670> these<00:00:31.820> crimp<00:00:32.150> beads<00:00:32.450> with

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
done here with these crimp beads with

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.960 
done here with these crimp beads with
loops<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:33.950> i<00:00:33.980> want<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.220> show<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:34.370> how<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.610> do<00:00:34.820> it

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
loops so i want to show you how to do it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.060 
loops so i want to show you how to do it
it's<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:35.420> easy<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:35.960> it's<00:00:36.079> a<00:00:36.140> great<00:00:36.410> technique

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
it's so easy and it's a great technique

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.010 
it's so easy and it's a great technique
to<00:00:37.280> know<00:00:37.310> so<00:00:38.090> i<00:00:38.120> just<00:00:38.329> have<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.540> length<00:00:38.870> of

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
to know so i just have a length of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.050 
to know so i just have a length of
beading<00:00:39.320> chain<00:00:39.350> right<00:00:39.739> here<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:40.250> i'm<00:00:40.880> going

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
beading chain right here and i'm going

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.240 
beading chain right here and i'm going
to<00:00:41.180> take<00:00:41.540> one<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.780> these<00:00:41.960> which<00:00:42.620> essentially

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
to take one of these which essentially

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.389 
to take one of these which essentially
is<00:00:43.400> just<00:00:43.700> a<00:00:44.180> crimp<00:00:44.510> tube<00:00:44.720> with<00:00:45.410> a<00:00:45.440> loop<00:00:45.829> already

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
is just a crimp tube with a loop already

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.330 
is just a crimp tube with a loop already
soldered<00:00:46.730> on<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.350> easiest<00:00:48.680> way<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:48.950> find

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
soldered on and the easiest way I find

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.370 
soldered on and the easiest way I find
to<00:00:49.610> apply<00:00:50.180> these<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.630> take<00:00:50.870> your<00:00:51.020> crimping

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
to apply these is take your crimping

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.030 
to apply these is take your crimping
pliers<00:00:52.270> go<00:00:53.270> ahead<00:00:53.829> capture<00:00:54.829> that<00:00:56.710> right<00:00:57.710> there

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
pliers go ahead capture that right there

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.130 
pliers go ahead capture that right there
in<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.700> part<00:00:59.000> of<00:00:59.120> your<00:00:59.239> crimping<00:00:59.570> pliers<00:00:59.840> it

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
in the part of your crimping pliers it

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.660 
in the part of your crimping pliers it
has<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.590> little<00:01:00.829> divot<00:01:01.190> that's<00:01:01.430> going<00:01:01.610> to

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
has the little divot that's going to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.880 
has the little divot that's going to
allow<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:02.000> be<00:01:02.120> scrunched<00:01:02.690> up<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:03.710> can

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
allow it to be scrunched up and you can

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.770 
allow it to be scrunched up and you can
see<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:04.220> I'm<00:01:04.370> not<00:01:04.400> grasping<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.420> near<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
see that I'm not grasping it near the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.649 
see that I'm not grasping it near the
loop<00:01:06.170> I'm<00:01:06.409> actually<00:01:07.100> as<00:01:07.430> far<00:01:07.760> from<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.450> loop

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
loop I'm actually as far from the loop

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.469 
loop I'm actually as far from the loop
as<00:01:08.870> I<00:01:09.080> can<00:01:09.229> possibly<00:01:09.409> be<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.180> then<00:01:11.180> all<00:01:11.330> you

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
as I can possibly be and then all you

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.980 
as I can possibly be and then all you
need<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.690> do<00:01:11.900> is<00:01:12.140> take<00:01:12.530> your<00:01:12.710> beading<00:01:13.040> chain

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
need to do is take your beading chain

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.690 
need to do is take your beading chain
and<00:01:14.990> just<00:01:15.020> drop<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.130> in<00:01:16.250> there<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:19.490> it's<00:01:19.670> just

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
and just drop it in there so it's just

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.850 
and just drop it in there so it's just
right<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.180> there<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.630> go<00:01:21.409> ahead<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.890> crimp

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.400 

and<00:01:25.580> then<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.390> like<00:01:26.540> any<00:01:26.720> other<00:01:26.870> crimp<00:01:27.200> bead

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
and then just like any other crimp bead

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.520 
and then just like any other crimp bead
go<00:01:28.280> ahead<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.640> do<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.820> second<00:01:29.180> step<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.660> just

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
go ahead and do the second step you just

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.090 
go ahead and do the second step you just
curve<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.190> over<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:33.110> there<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.800> go

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
curve that over and there you go

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.250 
curve that over and there you go
and<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.760> in<00:01:34.970> there<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.360> as<00:01:35.420> tight<00:01:35.780> as<00:01:36.050> not

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
and it is in there and as tight as not

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.650 
and it is in there and as tight as not
going<00:01:36.560> anywhere<00:01:36.880> it's<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.000> great<00:01:38.240> way<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.390> just

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
going anywhere it's a great way of just

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.450 
going anywhere it's a great way of just
finishing<00:01:39.260> your<00:01:39.350> beading<00:01:39.680> chain<00:01:39.710> end<00:01:40.190> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
finishing your beading chain end and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.940 
finishing your beading chain end and
then<00:01:41.210> all<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.540> need<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.810> do<00:01:41.960> as<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.650> can<00:01:42.680> see

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
then all you need to do as you can see

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.760 
then all you need to do as you can see
here<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.540> just<00:01:44.540> take<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.990> then<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.290> jump<00:01:45.530> ring

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
here I just take and then a jump ring

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.130 
here I just take and then a jump ring
and<00:01:45.950> attached<00:01:46.760> it<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.120> that<00:01:47.450> little<00:01:47.720> loop<00:01:47.870> and

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
and attached it to that little loop and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.710 
and attached it to that little loop and
then<00:01:48.320> attach<00:01:48.710> my<00:01:48.980> clasp<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.090> really<00:01:50.390> quick<00:01:50.600> and
