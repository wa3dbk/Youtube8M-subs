an average that it first
of<00:05:08.240> course<00:05:08.479> would<00:05:08.720> be<00:05:08.900> somewhat<00:05:09.500> confused<00:05:09.979> as

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
of course would be somewhat confused as

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.159

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
but then it becomes quite used to that

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.670 
but then it becomes quite used to that
animated<00:05:15.590> walk<00:05:16.039> and<00:05:16.990> it's<00:05:17.990> been<00:05:18.229> called<00:05:18.470> the
