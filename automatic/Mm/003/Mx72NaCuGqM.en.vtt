kind of I always sort of had dry skin

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.240 
kind of I always sort of had dry skin
but<00:00:12.990> I've<00:00:13.110> been<00:00:13.259> told<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.590> more<00:00:13.710> combination

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
but I've been told it's more combination

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.220 
but I've been told it's more combination
because<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.670> get<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> little<00:00:14.969> bit<00:00:15.179> oily<00:00:15.509> down<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
because I get a little bit oily down the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.090 
because I get a little bit oily down the
center<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.680> face

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
center of my face

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.019 
center of my face

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
and um I kind of tend to go towards

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.660 
and um I kind of tend to go towards
sensitive<00:00:21.480> skin<00:00:21.750> products<00:00:22.140> because<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:23.160> skin

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
sensitive skin products because my skin

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.500 
sensitive skin products because my skin
does<00:00:24.060> react<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.720> quite<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> few<00:00:26.000> ingredients<00:00:27.000> I

about<00:01:01.230> Kiehl's<00:01:01.680> products<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.430> aim

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
about Kiehl's products is that they aim

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.990 
about Kiehl's products is that they aim
to<00:01:03.409> do<00:01:04.409> their<00:01:04.830> job<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.489> says<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to do their job so this one says that it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
to do their job so this one says that it
will<00:01:06.150> cleanse<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> skin<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.020> remove<00:01:07.290> makeup

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
will cleanse the skin and remove makeup

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560 
will cleanse the skin and remove makeup
we're<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.310> drying<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.820> stripping<00:01:08.850> skin

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
we're not over drying or stripping skin

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.990 
we're not over drying or stripping skin
of<00:01:09.810> its<00:01:09.990> natural<00:01:10.049> oils<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:11.820> that's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
of its natural oils so I think that's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.310 
of its natural oils so I think that's
pretty<00:01:12.180> important<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.110> want

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
pretty important because you don't want

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.600 
pretty important because you don't want
something<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:13.920> make<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.400> skin

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
something that will make your skin

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.380 
something that will make your skin
really<00:01:14.729> tight<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.360> over<00:01:15.659> dried<00:01:15.869> um<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
really tight and over dried um so at the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
what I really like about this one is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.490 
what I really like about this one is
that<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.119> smells<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.540> iced<00:02:00.750> tea<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that it smells like iced tea and it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.249 
that it smells like iced tea and it's
got<00:02:01.680> even<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.579> guys<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.909> see<00:02:03.090> has<00:02:03.990> little

got even if you guys can see has little

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.780 
got even if you guys can see has little
bits<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.710> flour

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
bits of like flour

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.650 
bits of like flour
I<00:02:06.270> don't<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.630> horrible<00:02:07.049> bits<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:08.660> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
I don't know horrible bits in there so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.059 
I don't know horrible bits in there so
yeah<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> smells<00:02:10.140> really<00:02:10.560> nice<00:02:10.770> other

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
yeah it smells really nice other

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.830 
yeah it smells really nice other
cleanser<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.910> well<00:02:12.090> doesn't

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
cleanser as well doesn't

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.600 
cleanser as well doesn't
really<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> cent<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.190> anything

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
really have a cent to it if anything

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.080 
really have a cent to it if anything
it's<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:14.790> subtle<00:02:15.319> this<00:02:16.319> retails<00:02:16.800> for<00:02:17.090> $48

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
it's really subtle this retails for $48

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.190 
it's really subtle this retails for $48
so<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.480> little<00:02:18.629> bit<00:02:18.720> more<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:18.989> pricey

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so it's a little bit more on the pricey

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.660 
so it's a little bit more on the pricey
side<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:19.769> think<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.129> definitely<00:02:20.310> worth

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
side but I think it's definitely worth

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.360 
side but I think it's definitely worth
it<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.660> 250<00:02:22.379> mils<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.769> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.069> ask<00:02:23.220> me

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
it for 250 mils it's going to ask me

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.100 
it for 250 mils it's going to ask me
quite<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.610> few<00:02:23.819> months<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.120> moisturiser<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.930> got

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
quite a few months for moisturiser I got

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.160 
quite a few months for moisturiser I got
the<00:02:25.319> ultra<00:02:25.800> facial<00:02:25.980> cream<00:02:26.459> um<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:27.750> retails

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the ultra facial cream um this retails

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.259 
the ultra facial cream um this retails
for<00:02:29.569> $34<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.220> yeah<00:02:32.220> like<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.760> doesn't<00:02:33.030> smell

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
for $34 and yeah like it doesn't smell

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.759 
for $34 and yeah like it doesn't smell
too<00:02:33.330> strong<00:02:33.840> they<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.319> 30-day<00:02:34.739> guarantee

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
too strong they have a 30-day guarantee

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.789 
too strong they have a 30-day guarantee
so<00:02:35.840> which<00:02:36.840> didn't<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.319> make<00:02:37.440> me<00:02:37.620> hesitate

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
so which didn't really make me hesitate

so which didn't really make me hesitate

and this retails for $39 but for 14

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.330 
and this retails for $39 but for 14
grams<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.930> that's<00:03:28.049> really<00:03:28.230> decent<00:03:28.739> so

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
grams I think that's really decent so

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.009 
grams I think that's really decent so
something<00:03:29.639> about<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.060> eye<00:03:30.269> treatment<00:03:30.900> is

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
something about this eye treatment is

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.410 
something about this eye treatment is
that<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.500> apply<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> orbital<00:03:33.030> bone<00:03:33.180> so

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
that you apply it to the orbital bone so

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.300 
that you apply it to the orbital bone so
I'm<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.810> guess<00:03:34.109> your<00:03:34.230> eye<00:03:34.380> socket<00:03:34.859> so

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
I'm like I guess your eye socket so

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.740 
I'm like I guess your eye socket so
something<00:03:35.609> I<00:03:35.670> really<00:03:35.880> like<00:03:36.030> about<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.510> eye

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
something I really like about this eye

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.020 
something I really like about this eye
treatment<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.980> doesn't<00:03:38.400> um<00:03:38.579> sink

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
treatment is that it doesn't um sink

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.759 
treatment is that it doesn't um sink
into<00:03:39.180> your<00:03:39.389> skin<00:03:39.720> instead<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.349> kind<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.590> sits

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
into your skin instead it kind of sits

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.970 
into your skin instead it kind of sits
on<00:03:40.920> top<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.430> does<00:03:42.269> its<00:03:42.480> magic<00:03:42.900> um<00:03:43.079> this<00:03:43.709> can

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
on top and does its magic um this can

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.069 
on top and does its magic um this can
result<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.489> little<00:03:44.639> bit<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.819> shininess<00:03:45.150> if

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
result in a little bit of shininess if

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.110 
result in a little bit of shininess if
I'm<00:03:46.290> wearing<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.639> tends<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:47.910> go<00:03:48.090> away

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
I'm wearing it but that tends to go away

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.150 
I'm wearing it but that tends to go away
after<00:03:48.599> about<00:03:48.630> 20<00:03:49.200> or<00:03:49.319> 30<00:03:49.380> minutes<00:03:49.590> yeah<00:03:50.130> I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
after about 20 or 30 minutes yeah I

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.349
