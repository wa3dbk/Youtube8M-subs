00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.430 
conservative workplace this will come
out<00:00:35.040> after<00:00:35.340> several<00:00:35.820> washes<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:37.200> things

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
out after several washes the things

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
out after several washes the things
you're<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> need<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.820> water<00:00:39.719> bottle

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989

you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.579> method<00:00:42.030> dry<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.170> find

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you can do this method dry but I do find

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
you can do this method dry but I do find
it<00:00:43.980> works<00:00:44.190> best<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> dampen<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.750> hair

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it works best if you dampen the hair

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.310 
it works best if you dampen the hair
before<00:00:46.230> applying<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> color<00:00:48.110> you're<00:00:49.110> also

color what we're going to do first is

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
color what we're going to do first is
evaluate<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> hair<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:18.570> how<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.840> falls

towards the face and where the light
contours<00:01:21.960> pieces<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> use<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.990> right

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
contours pieces we want to use are right

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.499 
contours pieces we want to use are right
here<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> curl<00:01:25.770> around<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.880> face<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
here in the curl around the face and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.800 
here in the curl around the face and
also<00:01:28.259> towards<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> end<00:01:29.060> her<00:01:30.060> hair<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> lot

also towards the end her hair is a lot

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
also towards the end her hair is a lot
darker<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.189> towards<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
darker up here then it is towards the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.850 
darker up here then it is towards the
edges<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.049> stick<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
edges so we are going to stick with the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:47.410 
edges so we are going to stick with the
bottoms<00:01:35.189> today
