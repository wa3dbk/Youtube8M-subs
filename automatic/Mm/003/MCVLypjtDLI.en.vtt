00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.690
 working windows you like me on 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.790
 tells you this operation can take a 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.360
 some time so it takes to remove 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.390
 usb drives during the process the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.489
 usb drive on a format t it all 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.720
 the data stored on this one will be 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.910
 deleted 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.340
 is it because windows 8 points a 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:57.750
 turn to the bar formatted really the usb key 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:02.160
 to make an operating system that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.769
 will be bootable so looped click on 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.730
 create 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.269
 the operation will take a while 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:16.769
 because you have to prepare your reader 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:18.889
 usb or your usb key a formatting then to 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.500
 an installation 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:25.700
 so we'll leave a little bit of 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.099
 creation of the new action 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.180
 I'll get back to you as soon as it's done 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.180
 for the future 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:38.220
 good we come to the end of the process 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.519
 so at the completion of the creation of 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.180
 the workspace is africa same 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.150
 inactivated germs 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.170
 regardless of the catchy of your 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.800
 external hard drive 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:01.930
 the speed of transfer or usb keys 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.340
 it can take 10 15 25 minutes must 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.250
 so we will choose an option of 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.340
 start your workspace 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.230
 windows on clio is written do you want 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.570
 start automatically from 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.820
 this one when you start your pc 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:22.160
 I mean no because I want 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.110
 use safe for something that 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.560
 really important so I can use 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.280
 on any pc that will want on a 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.020
 usb key so you check no one you 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.240
 may need to change the settings 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.130
 firmware on your computer 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.440
 to use the workspace that 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.419
 means that one would have to enter the 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.860
 bios to paste configured for it 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:48.070
 start on a usb port 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:54.140
 so I'm going to click is not 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:57.280
 recorded which restarts and if not 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.669
 registered is closed for the moment 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.680
 that's languages ​​from there I'm going 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:09.940
 to show you a little what that gives in 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:12.590
 the windows to go is really something 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.220
 who will appear as here is a 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.220
 DVD player 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.620
 no he does not even appear in my thing 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.130
 that's what it's really 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.130
 operating system 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:43.950
 so he's not even recognized anymore in 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.990
 management 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:52.960
 it's really something now 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:54.910
 that they become cir is a system 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.080
 operating which is really set to 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.040
 share so here if I want to test it 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.389
 dangerous move on usb port 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.990
 normally it should really 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.990
 worked
