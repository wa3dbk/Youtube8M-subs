00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.690 

but<00:00:12.429> I<00:00:12.670> didn't<00:00:13.299> follow<00:00:13.900> it<00:00:14.049> much<00:00:14.379> before

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
but I didn't follow it much before

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.430 
but I didn't follow it much before
and<00:00:17.700> last<00:00:18.090> year<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.330> saw<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.960> saw<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.320> what

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
and last year you saw you saw just what

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.769 
and last year you saw you saw just what
you<00:00:19.529> mentioned<00:00:19.710> he<00:00:20.039> saw<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.779> favorites

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
you mentioned he saw the favorites

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.740 
you mentioned he saw the favorites
printers<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.000> there's<00:00:24.000> more<00:00:24.180> than<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.509> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
printers and there's more than one so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.269 
printers and there's more than one so
you<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> couple<00:00:25.200> of<00:00:25.349> teams<00:00:25.619> are<00:00:25.890> few<00:00:26.099> teens

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
you have a couple of teams are few teens

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
you have a couple of teams are few teens
that<00:00:26.520> can<00:00:26.700> control<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> rate<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.480> my<00:00:28.290> guess

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that can control the rate that my guess

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.020 
that can control the rate that my guess
is<00:00:28.740> we'd<00:00:28.890> see<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.220> again<00:00:31.279> but<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.000> other

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
is we'd see that again but the other

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.310 
is we'd see that again but the other
thing<00:00:33.239> too<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.449> if<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> look<00:00:33.900> out<00:00:34.080> on<00:00:34.110> some

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
thing too that if you look out on some

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.180 
thing too that if you look out on some
of<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:34.500> days<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.920> flags<00:00:35.160> stand<00:00:35.519> up<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> so

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
of these days of flags stand up and so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
of these days of flags stand up and so
that<00:00:38.190> opens<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> race<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:39.000> completely<00:00:39.449> for<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
that opens the race up completely for a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
that opens the race up completely for a
breakaway<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:41.750> selection<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.199> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
breakaway or for the selection in the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.650 
breakaway or for the selection in the
wind<00:00:43.650> so<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.610> got<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> pay<00:00:45.030> attention<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.540> that

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
wind so you got to pay attention to that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.320 
wind so you got to pay attention to that
but<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.769> I<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> there's

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
but and I think we all know that there's

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.000 
but and I think we all know that there's
these<00:00:48.600> handful<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> guys<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.710> writing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
these handful of guys that are writing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
these handful of guys that are writing
well<00:00:50.160> they're<00:00:50.460> focused<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.510> early<00:00:51.780> part<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
well they're focused on an early part of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
well they're focused on an early part of
the<00:00:52.170> season<00:00:52.200> not<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.250> generate<00:00:54.090> more<00:00:54.210> time

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the season not just generate more time

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
the season not just generate more time
but<00:00:54.629> also<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> Spring<00:00:55.289> Classics<00:00:55.770> we've<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but also the Spring Classics we've got a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610 
but also the Spring Classics we've got a
guy<00:00:57.059> statement<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.809> think<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
guy statement that I think is one of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
guy statement that I think is one of
those<00:00:58.770> people<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.190> clearly<00:00:59.789> focused<00:01:00.090> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
those people that's clearly focused on

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.249 
those people that's clearly focused on
the<00:01:00.510> classic<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.110> he's<00:01:01.260> ready<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> yeah

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
the classic so he's ready now so yeah

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.680 
the classic so he's ready now so yeah
you'll<00:01:04.770> have<00:01:04.800> some<00:01:05.129> control<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.700> again<00:01:06.149> with

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
you'll have some control but again with

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.660 
you'll have some control but again with
the<00:01:06.840> mills<00:01:07.050> which<00:01:07.320> target<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:07.920> Hills<00:01:08.100> than<00:01:08.399> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the mills which target more Hills than I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.380 
the mills which target more Hills than I
think<00:01:09.090> people<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:11.039> the<00:01:11.160> wind

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
think people think and then the wind

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.920 
think people think and then the wind
anything<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.479> happen

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.580 

I<00:01:19.140> think

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
I think

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.919 
I think
structure<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.100> they'll<00:01:21.189> also<00:01:21.340> use<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:22.149> think

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
structure and they'll also use I think

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.169 
structure and they'll also use I think
to<00:01:23.250> even<00:01:24.250> perhaps<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.729> more<00:01:24.909> than<00:01:25.030> anybody

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
to even perhaps you more than anybody

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.359 
to even perhaps you more than anybody
else's<00:01:25.600> technology<00:01:26.259> I<00:01:26.469> think<00:01:27.130> they'll<00:01:27.250> really

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
else's technology I think they'll really

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.980 
else's technology I think they'll really
push<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.850> envelope<00:01:28.000> when<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.570> comes<00:01:28.750> to

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
push the envelope when it comes to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.399 
push the envelope when it comes to
training<00:01:29.350> technology<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.310> aerodynamics<00:01:31.030> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
training technology and aerodynamics and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.749 
training technology and aerodynamics and
and<00:01:32.409> other<00:01:32.619> things<00:01:32.890> with<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.460> parts<00:01:33.670> of

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
and other things with the parts of

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.330 
and other things with the parts of
materials<00:01:34.270> that<00:01:34.539> that<00:01:35.109> will<00:01:35.259> all<00:01:35.500> look<00:01:35.770> at<00:01:36.009> on

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
materials that that will all look at on

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.429 
materials that that will all look at on
certain<00:01:36.700> days<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:36.909> go<00:01:37.060> whoa<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:37.630> never<00:01:38.289> saw

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
certain days and go whoa I never saw

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
certain days and go whoa I never saw
that<00:01:38.469> before<00:01:38.679> and<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:40.420> think<00:01:40.659> that's<00:01:40.810> good<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.590> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that before and I think that's good so I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:52.240 
that before and I think that's good so I
expect<00:01:43.509> they'll<00:01:44.229> be<00:01:44.319> good<00:01:44.439> very<00:01:45.100> good

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.960 

it's<00:01:52.940> not<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.330> cycling<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.870> we<00:01:53.990> saw<00:01:54.170> in<00:01:54.970> the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
it's not the cycling that we saw in the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.860 
it's not the cycling that we saw in the
days<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.390> eddy<00:01:56.570> merckx<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:58.570> burn<00:01:59.570> aren't<00:01:59.780> you

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
days of eddy merckx and burn aren't you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.770 
days of eddy merckx and burn aren't you
know<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.430> even<00:02:01.430> enduring<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:01.940> mean<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.360> was<00:02:02.510> at

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
know and even enduring I mean it was at

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.110 
know and even enduring I mean it was at
least<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.650> sport<00:02:04.280> has<00:02:04.370> become<00:02:04.670> much<00:02:04.880> more

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
least the sport has become much more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.990 
least the sport has become much more
global<00:02:05.890> I'm<00:02:06.890> not<00:02:07.070> exactly<00:02:07.400> sure<00:02:07.550> why<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:08.330> is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
global I'm not exactly sure why that is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.160 
global I'm not exactly sure why that is
but<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.060> don't<00:02:11.300> think<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.600> bad<00:02:11.690> thing<00:02:11.750> I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
but I don't think it's a bad thing I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.880 
but I don't think it's a bad thing I
think<00:02:12.380> it's<00:02:12.470> good<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:13.030> we<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.500> major<00:02:15.500> teams

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
think it's good that we have major teams

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.940 
think it's good that we have major teams
from<00:02:16.130> all<00:02:16.340> continents<00:02:17.180> on<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.570> planet<00:02:17.950> let's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
from all continents on the planet let's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.860 
from all continents on the planet let's

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
future there be an Australian team and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.800 
future there be an Australian team and
you<00:02:25.400> have<00:02:25.550> an<00:02:25.670> Asian<00:02:25.790> team<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> south

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
you have an Asian team in the south

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.300 
you have an Asian team in the south
american<00:02:27.290> team<00:02:27.440> which<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:27.830> had<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.160> past

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
american team which we had in the past

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.890 
american team which we had in the past
but<00:02:28.670> I've<00:02:29.480> been<00:02:29.600> absent<00:02:29.959> for<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.170> while<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:31.900> think

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
but I've been absent for a while I think

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.620 
but I've been absent for a while I think
that<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.459> globalization<00:02:34.459> recycling<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.570> a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
that the globalization recycling is is a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.150 
that the globalization recycling is is a
plus<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.610> think<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:38.239> it's<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.890> depth

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
plus and I think that if it's the depth

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.590 
plus and I think that if it's the depth
of<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> teams<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.850> come<00:02:41.030> from<00:02:41.180> all<00:02:41.330> over<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
of the teams that come from all over the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.960 
of the teams that come from all over the
world<00:02:41.630> or<00:02:42.050> if<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.440> simply<00:02:42.800> as<00:02:43.070> we<00:02:43.250> again<00:02:43.820> as

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
world or if it's simply as we again as

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.400 
world or if it's simply as we again as
we<00:02:44.090> spoke<00:02:44.300> about<00:02:44.420> there<00:02:44.660> are<00:02:44.750> they<00:02:44.870> taking<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
we spoke about there are they taking the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.470 
we spoke about there are they taking the
World<00:02:45.560> Championships<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.910> other<00:02:47.150> places

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
World Championships to other places

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
World Championships to other places
besides<00:02:48.610> belgium<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.760> italy<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.300> france<00:02:50.330> and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
besides belgium and italy and france and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.360 
besides belgium and italy and france and
switzerland<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.700> spain<00:02:53.030> i<00:02:53.420> think<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:53.989> also

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
switzerland and spain i think it also

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.660 
switzerland and spain i think it also
needs<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.520> travel<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:57.190> it's<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.310> good<00:02:58.459> thing

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
needs to travel so it's a good thing

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.550 
needs to travel so it's a good thing
it's<00:02:59.239> as<00:02:59.510> fine<00:02:59.750> as<00:02:59.930> i<00:03:00.019> said<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.290> might<00:03:00.410> be<00:03:00.440> a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
it's as fine as i said it might be a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.039 
it's as fine as i said it might be a
little<00:03:00.709> surprising<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.519> some<00:03:02.060> maybe<00:03:02.750> even<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
little surprising to some maybe even to

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.130 
little surprising to some maybe even to
me<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:05.120> know<00:03:05.209> cycling<00:03:05.600> also<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.080> a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
me but you know cycling also is in a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.350 
me but you know cycling also is in a
position<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.560> now<00:03:06.890> where<00:03:07.100> if<00:03:07.850> somebody<00:03:08.060> can

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
position to now where if somebody can

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.229 
position to now where if somebody can
come<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.280> sustain<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> 20<00:03:10.820> million<00:03:11.090> dollar

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
come in and sustain a 20 million dollar

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.440 
come in and sustain a 20 million dollar
budget<00:03:12.070> then<00:03:13.070> that's<00:03:13.280> good<00:03:13.489> right<00:03:14.000> now<00:03:14.060> with

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
budget then that's good right now with

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.449 
budget then that's good right now with
the<00:03:14.540> state<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.930> sport<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.500> think<00:03:16.280> it's<00:03:16.400> a

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
the state of the sport I think it's a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.550 
the state of the sport I think it's a
good<00:03:16.580> education<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.330> good<00:03:17.510> sign

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.190 

well

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
well

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.640 
well
the<00:03:25.530> most<00:03:25.739> obvious<00:03:25.950> thing<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.340> now<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:27.180> kids

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
the most obvious thing is now for kids

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.630 
the most obvious thing is now for kids
like<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.770> said<00:03:28.950> 10<00:03:29.160> years<00:03:29.340> ago<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.580> had<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:29.970> but

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
like I said 10 years ago I had one but

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.020 
like I said 10 years ago I had one but
you<00:03:32.640> know<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.849> fact<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.890> I'm<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.340> am<00:03:35.580> 38

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
you know the fact that that I'm I am 38

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.500 
you know the fact that that I'm I am 38
with<00:03:36.239> with<00:03:36.510> four<00:03:36.720> children<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:38.360> that's<00:03:39.360> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
with with four children and that's a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.380 
with with four children and that's a
significant<00:03:40.290> difference<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.800> 15<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.090> think

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
significant difference in 15 and I think

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.330 
significant difference in 15 and I think
everybody's<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.080> parent<00:03:43.560> will<00:03:43.739> tell<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.310> that

walk<00:04:29.639> into<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.030> bar<00:04:30.060> or<00:04:30.539> into<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.229> coffee<00:04:31.470> shop<00:04:31.620> to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
walk into a bar or into a coffee shop to

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.750 
walk into a bar or into a coffee shop to
store<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:34.470> wasn't<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:34.950> way<00:04:35.010> ten<00:04:35.340> years<00:04:35.520> ago<00:04:35.669> I

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
store it wasn't that way ten years ago I

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.360 
store it wasn't that way ten years ago I
could<00:04:36.000> go<00:04:36.090> anywhere<00:04:36.440> but<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:38.039> too<00:04:38.280> has

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
could go anywhere but that too has

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.290 
could go anywhere but that too has
changed<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:41.010> really<00:04:41.190> really<00:04:41.430> those<00:04:41.760> those<00:04:42.270> are

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
changed so really really those those are

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.450 
changed so really really those those are
the<00:04:42.479> two<00:04:42.660> things<00:04:42.840> none<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.710> which<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.250> would

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
the two things none of which I would

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.029 
the two things none of which I would
ever<00:04:44.580> complain<00:04:45.000> about<00:04:45.150> it's<00:04:46.050> been<00:04:46.289> it's<00:04:46.950> been

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
ever complain about it's been it's been

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.170 
ever complain about it's been it's been
a<00:04:47.130> good<00:04:47.310> run<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:50.220> kids<00:04:50.430> are<00:04:50.550> healthy<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.000> kids

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
a good run the kids are healthy the kids

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.820 
a good run the kids are healthy the kids
are<00:04:51.300> happy<00:04:51.479> so<00:04:51.660> on<00:04:51.930> all<00:04:52.440> fronts<00:04:54.470> 38<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.620> heck

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
are happy so on all fronts 38 is a heck

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.399 
are happy so on all fronts 38 is a heck
of<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.979> lot<00:04:56.010> better<00:04:56.160> for<00:04:56.520> 28<00:04:56.970> for<00:04:57.150> me

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.609 

I<00:05:03.529> think<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.129> answer<00:05:04.399> is<00:05:04.639> it's<00:05:04.849> a<00:05:04.909> hybrid<00:05:05.619> what

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:06.619 
I think the answer is it's a hybrid what

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:10.600 
I think the answer is it's a hybrid what
we<00:05:06.739> saw<00:05:06.919> last<00:05:07.039> year<00:05:07.459> but<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:09.889> racing<00:05:10.129> side<00:05:10.580> of

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
we saw last year but the racing side of

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.269 
we saw last year but the racing side of
things<00:05:10.849> will<00:05:11.119> be<00:05:11.239> different<00:05:11.389> in<00:05:12.169> two<00:05:12.919> thousand

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:13.279 
things will be different in two thousand

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.979 
things will be different in two thousand
miles<00:05:13.459> because<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:14.059> team<00:05:14.239> is<00:05:14.269> different<00:05:14.839> than

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:14.989 
miles because the team is different than

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:16.749 
miles because the team is different than
this<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.589> pressure<00:05:15.889> of<00:05:16.099> the<00:05:16.129> emphasis<00:05:16.550> on

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
this the pressure of the emphasis on

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.629 
this the pressure of the emphasis on
that<00:05:17.029> team<00:05:17.239> being<00:05:17.569> a<00:05:17.629> new<00:05:17.749> team<00:05:18.459> american<00:05:19.459> team

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.690 

well<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.390> mean<00:05:38.780> you<00:05:38.900> it's<00:05:39.020> easy<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:39.980> say<00:05:40.130> yes<00:05:40.370> but

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
well I mean you it's easy to say yes but

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.400 
well I mean you it's easy to say yes but
at<00:05:41.450> the<00:05:41.570> same<00:05:41.720> time<00:05:41.900> there's<00:05:42.170> other<00:05:42.320> things

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
at the same time there's other things

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.390 
at the same time there's other things
that<00:05:42.620> work<00:05:42.800> against<00:05:43.130> me<00:05:44.050> age<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:46.370> fact

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
that work against me age and the fact

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.820 
that work against me age and the fact
that<00:05:46.730> that<00:05:47.090> other<00:05:47.300> guys<00:05:47.540> are<00:05:47.830> probably

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
that that other guys are probably

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.310 
that that other guys are probably
getting<00:05:49.220> stronger<00:05:49.580> so<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.210> like<00:05:50.930> to<00:05:51.050> think<00:05:51.200> so

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
getting stronger so I like to think so

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
getting stronger so I like to think so
but<00:05:53.590> slightly<00:05:54.590> race<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.730> find<00:05:55.910> out<00:05:56.120> there
