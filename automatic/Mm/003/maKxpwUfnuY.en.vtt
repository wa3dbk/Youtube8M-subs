00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hello, my name is Rina 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.670
 in this video I will tell you how 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 eat while practicing thai boxing 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 he is perhaps an important point is the power 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.610
 pay attention to the quality of food 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.279
 Of course it is sometimes difficult to resist eating 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 mangaka cheeseburger with french fries and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.970
 Stage doubt very tasty but 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.619
 useless and even harmful at all 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 most of the products that are gathering dust 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 supermarket shelves has a very poor 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.400
 nutritional value and the presence of any e-shek 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.800
 this price we pay for convenience and taste and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.079
 so what is all the same to eat a Muay fighter 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.880
 Thai Thai boxing is more 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.680
 intensive work due to which 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.780
 a lot of calories are lost and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 energy and for the energy we are responsible 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.829
 carbohydrates consequently food in muay 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
 tai need to focus on them 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.610
 the truth is there are small nuances and a minimum 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.530
 glycemic index 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.149
 roughly speaking this is the sugar release rate 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 maximum value in blood 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.140
 glycemic index is 100 than she 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 lower the slower the more evenly 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.219
 there is a blood sugar surge that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.079
 good for us so how will it be us 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.579
 feed for a long time in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.350
 common carbohydrates with high 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.420
 the glycemic index is called 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 fast carbohydrates low slow 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.119
 carbohydrates 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.040
 You probably noticed that eating sweet 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.049
 bun or chocolate we are not only very 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.909
 quickly get saturated but just as fast 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.979
 again want to eat it just because 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.720
 high glycemic index and low 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.189
 nutritional value therefore should 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 choose foods low glycemic 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.640
 the index itself is the best choice on my 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 look this porridge 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.950
 features buckwheat oatmeal toffee bean 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 wholemeal pasta bread will also be 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 very helpful desirable bite on 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.590
 add some fiber for general 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.630
 piston and glycemic index proteins 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.670
 they are in our bodies are also not out of thin air 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.840
 appear and respond and construction 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.880
 protective processes 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.590
 so penetrated, too, should not be forgotten 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.420
 principle vegetable proteins there and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.009
 the above products but for 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 Most advise getting it from 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.980
 dairy products and meat only 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.630
 condition so buy it with a minimum 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.760
 in fat, that is an example 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.280
 low fat cottage cheese or group is drilled 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.500
 why skim about it further fats 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.360
 of them are afraid of thai boxing and just 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.260
 man can not do fats 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 two types 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.860
 animals because of their nature 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.050
 negative here on the body 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.660
 human raising cholesterol 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.580
 increase the chances of atherosclerosis improve 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.250
 the state of the liver and its properties 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.470
 put aside in reserve vegetable this 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.030
 just what we need eat nuts and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.100
 water seeds and vegetable salad 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.020
 eat butter fish and try 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.040
 minimize dates of fried 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.080
 chicken wings 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.910
 reusable coconut oil and its 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.710
 stomach and do not forget about vegetables and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 fruits in them fiber vitamins and 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.440
 minerals 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.300
 general nutritional guidelines in thai 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.340
 eat less on box more often 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.050
 the food system will not be overloaded and 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.730
 the body will always be fed 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.620
 nutrients in the morning 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.720
 focus on carbohydrates and closer to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.640
 in the evening, shift the side of proteins because 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.300
 the body is more energy hungry after 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.340
 wake up 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.680
 do not go to training hungry eat 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.090
 at least something after a workout if not 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.800
 Slow down 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.450
 carbohydrates you can pamper yourself 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.400
 sweet since after enhanced 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.590
 physical exertion opens so 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.480
 called protein carbohydrate window and in 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.060
 these moments fast carbs will be 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.140
 quite by the way this 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.630
 there will be an article you can find on my 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.380
 site lawsuits dot ru thanks for 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.380
 attention all bye
