00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.150
 jo people I sign up here again 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 a new comments back finally 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.109
 I have to say yes again 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 Unfortunately, I was a week long now 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 put something out of action I was one 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 little bit sick could not really be good 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.769
 I'll talk to him and he'll have a go 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 time out 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
 by the way , who experienced something like that in advance 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.740
 if I want to make my weekly nothing 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 or something else is the times should 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.859
 on facebook or twitter with me 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.730
 drop by the left are always in 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.410
 the description 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.030
 I think we can do some more 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.320
 I would bring people to these pages 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.520
 In any case, if you like me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.379
 would drop by 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.510
 but of course it works now 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.340
 fresh as I said it is still 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 not completely gone but it works again 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.899
 and now come back videos and today 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 is it about easter eggs yes finally 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 again and there is something new in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 battlefield 4 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 it's just a trifle but me 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.260
 think it's worth mentioning and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.199
 though if you have the cd version of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.789
 battlefield 4 has that is the community 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.949
 testament version it now somehow 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.270
 then for premium players there should be 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.040
 Always stay at Hainan resort 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.400
 drop by because there is now one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.400
 maypole 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.790
 Of course you can ask yourself now 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.400
 why is there a May tree at the end of june? 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.800
 that is a bit weird that can 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.720
 I explain to you because the sweden where 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.420
 since it is also established I say 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.190
 celebrate the summer solstice and this 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.350
 has in june the election now before some 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.330
 days and closer are there 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.740
 somehow so maypole on and celebrate that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.420
 that's just what they have now 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.100
 made on my battlefield 4 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.900
 I have to say the idea is pretty 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.210
 cool I think as Swede finds 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.190
 the much cooler we are in 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.990
 our latitudes find that 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.890
 probably a little something 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.540
 should that be 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.580
 but no matter I thought it was on everyone 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.220
 worth a mention and now 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.970
 Let's go to your favorite game 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.040
 battlefield leyen yes I know that 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.120
 opinion against very far apart it 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.440
 Many have me in the comments 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.460
 I think it stupid many 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.650
 have also described they find it 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.750
 really good and the interesting thing 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.790
 I've read that many have said 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.320
 First I found the game very nice 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.060
 bad but then I have it 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.860
 tried it and then it was 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.780
 not so bad and I have to say 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.250
 really do it yourself 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.110
 impression of the game as a video 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.120
 is not enough to judge 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 Just try it out and then 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.780
 can you still say if hotline 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.880
 good or bad is as I said in the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.340
 In the autumn there will only be an open beta 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.840
 give all the platforms and I think 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.760
 there will be everyone the opportunity 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.830
 get to try that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.170
 but we want to talk to easter today 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.880
 I deal with eggs in hartheim 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.350
 the game is not out yet and you 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.180
 probably can not quite like that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.830
 I have a lot to say but I have 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.110
 of course, as an essay can be one 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.090
 bit wary in battlefield 4 gave 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 it is relatively many and cool the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.020
 Experts in the megalodon we had the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 yeti evaluate the big ship's explosion 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.860
 value the animal experts and everything goes 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.209
 so on in hardliner or now 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.940
 that does not interest me, of course 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.500
 but no, do not worry, I know now 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.360
 not the rest of the video about it 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.130
 speculate because that would be nonsense 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.080
 No I thought once I watch 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.060
 give me a closer look at the beta 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.130
 and see if I have a few hints 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.300
 I can see how visual this is 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.610
 the studio what lane now hard 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.140
 developed on it is whether that too 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.090
 again, it is funny whether such 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.560
 things to pack up and I can 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.600
 Immediately say I was not disappointed 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.580
 I found some things 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.110
 some are certainly easter eggs 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.180
 some things are probably too 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.799
 just a little bit with 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.180
 interpreted by me they are 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.650
 Maybe it's funny if you do it like that 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.239
 does not look like I might also 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.859
 you can decide for yourself 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.750
 In any case, some are funny 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.489
 things in it like I said some of them 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.560
 surely the ex is some 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.269
 guaranteed not but I thought I 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.099
 sometimes you put everything here in this video 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.900
 in and we catch here with the 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.609
 restaurants in the middle of the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.889
 map and we have it here 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.450
 once the twenty four seven noodle shop 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.069
 and if you look like this 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.599
 that is mandatory 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.250
 funny is a joke but now 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.200
 hey i think it's pretty good 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.450
 Of course we also have the kamikaze 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.169
 Sushi bad is not allowed either 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.730
 absence 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.620
 By the way, who does not know what? 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.970
 kamikaze is he should absolutely 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.669
 Googling but I guess that knows her 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.459
 Of course, then we still have ourselves 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.810
 some movie posters on the map the one 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.459
 probably not so noticeable 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.009
 if you only play on it I am 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.930
 gone extreme spectator mode and got it 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.690
 have a look what standing there for posters 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.300
 and but some funny things while we 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.889
 have for example once ghostface 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.960
 okay that can mean anything now but 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.539
 I think it could be an allusion 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.830
 call of duty be great and that we on 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.539
 any case really fun if it really 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.639
 so if it's something else 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.710
 it should not represent 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.880
 I'm sorry now but I have 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.380
 there's a little bit of the linkage 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.150
 I say, I say 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.680
 then we have a poster with the 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.240
 dead rise and that reminds me 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.070
 Of course, that's a bit of dead rising 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.050
 or to the tv series the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.349
 walking dead that changes a bit 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.550
 tuned 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.830
 and now we have it very interesting 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.590
 is we have a poster with the prince 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.139
 of san francisco and that's guaranteed 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.729
 an easter egg when we look at it 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.130
 that is not unknown so maybe 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.960
 it is already unknown but remains 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.849
 not long unknown because that is the 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.039
 executive producer of battlefield 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.380
 Hotline and the guy actually means 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.180
 Steve Papoutsis and I have to say that 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.009
 name sounds so funny that me 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.720
 someone had a tree because i had it 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.520
 just did not get to the series 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.320
 but I have to say it is really cool 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.570
 that he himself in this, so to speak 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.039
 You have to immortalize beta first 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.930
 and that is definitely one 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.370
 easter egg as I said of course 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.389
 we also have other things we do 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.240
 have here for example this 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.650
 election poster where you naturally so wiest of 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.940
 the deep sees and that has me 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.310
 of course, just a little bit to the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.270
 Megalodon recalls maybe there is 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.190
 elections 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.260
 let's wait times from I rather think 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.670
 not that he will play in the usa 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.230
 and not in the ocean anyway 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.240
 But let's just wait and see 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.270
 Definitely a choice statue from 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.680
 museum which I find quite cool the 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.030
 sea ​​monsters have so show theirs 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.860
 found space again 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.410
 then we have this sandwich here 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.720
 poster what i was especially celebrating was there 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.030
 really dransteht the actual size 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.920
 means to say as original size and that 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.020
 whole is just clapped on the bus 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.520
 that means of course you understand into 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.490
 affordable I will not explain it now 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.960
 I think in any case very funny and 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.390
 then I could hardly believe my eyes 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.940
 what i have yet seen one 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.530
 megalodon oh well I do not know whether it 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.210
 a megalodon is it could be too 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.340
 White sharks are definitely if you are 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.870
 Here you go in this bus 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.700
 actually a poster of one 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.580
 megalodon and of course I had to 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.500
 there is also nena triumph and celebrating 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.600
 I think that's an allusion 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.550
 the big i steak from battlefield 4 me 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.320
 I can not explain why 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.030
 you miss this award 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.190
 have packed and I think that has 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.870
 I have to say something to do with it 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.880
 all very cool and because so many 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.760
 smaller things are already in the 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.280
 beta I think that in hotline too 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.750
 I expect a lot bigger 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.640
 there will certainly be something we will see 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.140
 yes, how better are they on 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.540
 every time really fun on it 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.310
 I'll say that and serious stuff in 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.350
 the game for example this poster with 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.870
 Of course, that's not the case with the sandwich 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.310
 right heat stations I say 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.720
 in real life this is really only in 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.580
 Battlefield and I like that on everyone 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.050
 very well and I hope he does 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.450
 really pack up such things again 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.730
 I think the first indications 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.710
 We have found and there are 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.170
 of course, a real easter egg 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.540
 a something new a bigger though it is 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.880
 is also still small and looks at you 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.500
 check out the donuts in the police station 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.360
 and then you can get the mascots 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.590
 I read that here after my car 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.780
 then you can go through this 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.860
 all I listen again here in the video 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.960
 Of course, I would like to take this opportunity 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.040
 I look forward to a review, I hope so 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.050
 whole has failed 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.180
 My name is more quest and I am 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:42.180
 out now and have fun with the donuts 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.180
 by 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:48.300
 it is all full 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.300
 You see that
