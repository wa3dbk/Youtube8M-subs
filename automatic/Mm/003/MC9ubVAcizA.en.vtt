00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.310
 hello I'm javier gÃ¼emes from the tijuana club 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.410
 a lot of joy a lot of anxiety to be 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.350
 there 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.930
 well that is one of the objectives that 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.230
 we have planned during our 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.230
 career 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.279
 If I expect the same, I hope 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.620
 a great group a great and a great team 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.430
 that is killed by defending the colors 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.559
 of your country and in the same way 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.260
 delivering all that is what we 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.170
 characterizes us forgiveness and what 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.510
 that led us to be there is no reason why 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.199
 change a lot of much responsibility I think 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.730
 that I am representing an institution 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.769
 to a great institution 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.550
 so many of my colleagues that I think 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.720
 they could also have a call and it's 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.190
 a very big responsibility 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.860
 and show why they call us 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.700
 nothing more not always since he plays at 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.080
 football 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.310
 in the selection with the instruction 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.579
 I want to play a world cup 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.220
 represent my country since I start 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.380
 to play he had the best of when you're 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.680
 professional but always always 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.650
 selection 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.840
 that's one step, there's not much way left 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.020
 a lot to prove a lot that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020
 develop 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.780
 and that is not my goal no more to have 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.030
 summoned calls for pardon yes no 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.560
 and be able to make a referent to consolidate 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.270
 in his election and to be able to play a world cup 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.270
 very good I think 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.140
 from the moment you're there comes 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.330
 being new that quickly integrate the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.160
 group and I think that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.470
 makes things easier for you to 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.890
 adapt 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.360
 they obviously know that it is an institution 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.950
 young woman who has a lot of desire to 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.070
 transcend and what does it come 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.070
 working very well not for years
