couple of weeks ago for a farmer's wife
she<00:05:00.460> was<00:05:00.580> 50<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:01.780> she<00:05:01.810> plays<00:05:02.500> dominoes<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:04.120> the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
she was 50 and she plays dominoes so the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.100 
she was 50 and she plays dominoes so the
cake<00:05:04.840> had<00:05:05.290> two<00:05:06.220> pigs<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.910> two<00:05:07.330> cows<00:05:07.660> playing

dominoes the odd chicken here and there

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.040 
dominoes the odd chicken here and there
