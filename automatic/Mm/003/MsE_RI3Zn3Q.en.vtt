as<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.070> see<00:01:38.250> there's<00:01:38.520> two<00:01:38.640> main<00:01:39.299> gold

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
as you can see there's two main gold

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.899 
as you can see there's two main gold
rocks<00:01:39.900> which<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.500> use<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.430> bank<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
rocks which I use and the bank in the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.819 
rocks which I use and the bank in the
middle<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.810> bank<00:01:43.110> only<00:01:43.290> acts<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
middle there the bank only acts as a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
middle there the bank only acts as a
deposit<00:01:44.369> box<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.060> only<00:01:45.360> deposit<00:01:45.750> your

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
deposit box so you can only deposit your

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
deposit box so you can only deposit your
boars<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.490> withdraw<00:01:47.850> anything

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
boars in there and not withdraw anything

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
boars in there and not withdraw anything
which<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> slight<00:01:49.290> drawback<00:01:49.530> from<00:01:49.979> this

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
which is a slight drawback from this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.190 
which is a slight drawback from this

so here's the video of me training my
mining<00:03:22.770> skill<00:03:23.040> here<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.790> starting<00:03:24.420> off<00:03:24.540> in

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
mining skill here I'm starting off in

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.110 
mining skill here I'm starting off in
the<00:03:24.690> center<00:03:25.110> at<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.560> bank<00:03:25.890> at<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.220> pili<00:03:26.430> I'm

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
the center at the bank at the pili I'm

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.970 
the center at the bank at the pili I'm
heading<00:03:27.480> south<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> south<00:03:28.290> east<00:03:28.500> gold

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
heading south to the south east gold

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.740 
heading south to the south east gold
mineral<00:03:29.310> deposit<00:03:29.730> there<00:03:30.240> is<00:03:30.360> usually<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
mineral deposit there is usually a

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.450 
mineral deposit there is usually a
constant<00:03:31.290> stream<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.530> people<00:03:31.800> running<00:03:32.310> in

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
constant stream of people running in

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.640 
constant stream of people running in
between<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.850> bank<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.780> mineral<00:03:34.170> deposit

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
between the bank and the mineral deposit

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.800 
between the bank and the mineral deposit
so<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:35.190> easily<00:03:35.520> see<00:03:35.970> which<00:03:36.150> ones<00:03:36.450> open

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
so you can easily see which ones open

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.160

a<00:04:14.409> mining<00:04:14.829> boost<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:15.280> think<00:04:15.549> it's<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:15.939> easier

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
a mining boost I think it's just easier

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.229 
a mining boost I think it's just easier
but<00:04:17.259> if<00:04:17.349> you<00:04:17.500> are<00:04:17.620> level<00:04:17.859> 96<00:04:18.579> summoning<00:04:19.090> or

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
but if you are level 96 summoning or

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.849 
but if you are level 96 summoning or
higher<00:04:19.419> you<00:04:19.720> should<00:04:19.989> definitely<00:04:20.709> go<00:04:20.829> ahead

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
higher you should definitely go ahead

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.980 
higher you should definitely go ahead
and<00:04:21.190> use<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.310> Pak<00:04:21.579> yak<00:04:21.849> it'll<00:04:22.449> probably<00:04:22.660> save

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
and use a Pak yak it'll probably save

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.890

area<00:04:48.610> is<00:04:48.759> that<00:04:48.910> virtually<00:04:49.840> everyone<00:04:50.380> has<00:04:50.530> a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
area is that virtually everyone has a

area is that virtually everyone has a
skill<00:04:50.949> kit<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.550> it's<00:04:51.729> just<00:04:52.419> kinda<00:04:52.690> crazy<00:04:52.900> to

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
skill kit and it's just kinda crazy to

skill kit and it's just kinda crazy to
see<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.860> this<00:04:54.009> is<00:04:54.159> the<00:04:54.460> exact<00:04:54.820> reason<00:04:54.909> why

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
see and this is the exact reason why

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.680 
see and this is the exact reason why
gold<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:55.960> plummeting<00:04:56.349> because<00:04:56.860> there's

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
gold is plummeting because there's

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.240

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
huge amounts of gold so it's inevitably

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
directly on the pili system and this

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.660 
directly on the pili system and this
will<00:05:28.350> bring<00:05:28.470> up<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.740> message<00:05:29.040> in<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.250> chat<00:05:29.460> box

world the faster these ores will respond

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.010 
world the faster these ores will respond
I<00:05:58.460> also<00:05:59.460> believe<00:05:59.820> that<00:05:59.850> the<00:06:00.210> mineral<00:06:00.570> deposits

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
I also believe that the mineral deposits

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.230 
I also believe that the mineral deposits
run<00:06:01.170> on<00:06:01.260> timers<00:06:01.740> and<00:06:01.980> they<00:06:02.430> run<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.790> ores<00:06:03.000> at

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
run on timers and they run of ores at

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.390 
run on timers and they run of ores at
random<00:06:03.570> intervals<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:04.230> the<00:06:05.070> more<00:06:05.220> people

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
random intervals and the more people

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.310 
random intervals and the more people
that<00:06:05.580> are<00:06:05.790> in<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.030> main<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.570> longer<00:06:06.960> these

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
that are in the main the longer these

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.410 
that are in the main the longer these
intervals<00:06:07.920> will<00:06:08.250> be<00:06:08.400> before<00:06:08.640> the<00:06:08.970> waters<00:06:09.210> will

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420

people asking me oh is a dragon pickaxe
poor<00:06:16.560> fit<00:06:16.770> or<00:06:16.980> should<00:06:17.580> I<00:06:17.700> buy<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:17.910> dragon

pickaxe well if you're planning on
getting<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.940> lot<00:06:21.180> of<00:06:21.210> levels<00:06:21.540> I'd<00:06:21.990> say<00:06:22.260> yes

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
getting a lot of levels I'd say yes

definitely

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
definitely

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.630 
definitely
I<00:06:23.520> believe<00:06:24.210> dragon<00:06:24.720> pickaxes<00:06:25.290> are<00:06:25.500> 15%<00:06:26.430> per

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
I believe dragon pickaxes are 15% per

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.330 
I believe dragon pickaxes are 15% per
faster<00:06:27.090> than<00:06:27.270> rune<00:06:27.450> pickaxes<00:06:28.050> so<00:06:28.800> getting

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
faster than rune pickaxes so getting

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.520 
faster than rune pickaxes so getting
that<00:06:29.430> your<00:06:29.550> name<00:06:29.670> mining<00:06:30.180> will<00:06:30.330> be<00:06:30.450> 15%<00:06:31.350> faster

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
that your name mining will be 15% faster

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.390 
that your name mining will be 15% faster
using<00:06:31.950> a<00:06:32.130> dragon<00:06:32.490> pickaxe<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.230> a<00:06:34.230> 15%<00:06:34.710> doesn't

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
using a dragon pickaxe and a 15% doesn't

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.820 
using a dragon pickaxe and a 15% doesn't
sound<00:06:35.640> very<00:06:35.730> convincing<00:06:36.450> think<00:06:37.140> of<00:06:37.260> mining<00:06:37.680> as

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
sound very convincing think of mining as

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.880 
sound very convincing think of mining as
hours<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.460> walked<00:06:39.270> out<00:06:39.570> there<00:06:40.320> getting<00:06:40.710> from

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
level what 91 to 99 main in here is

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.100 
level what 91 to 99 main in here is
around<00:06:44.340> a<00:06:44.490> hundred<00:06:44.610> hours<00:06:44.910> so<00:06:45.540> a<00:06:45.780> dragon

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
around a hundred hours so a dragon

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.990 
around a hundred hours so a dragon
pickaxe<00:06:46.500> will<00:06:46.770> potentially<00:06:47.250> save<00:06:47.400> you<00:06:47.760> over

main<00:07:05.610> is<00:07:05.730> up<00:07:05.880> southeast<00:07:06.540> down<00:07:06.780> means<00:07:07.050> the

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
main is up southeast down means the

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.650 
main is up southeast down means the
southeast<00:07:07.680> main<00:07:08.040> is<00:07:08.190> down<00:07:08.400> so<00:07:09.030> you<00:07:09.090> can't<00:07:09.450> mean

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
southeast main is down so you can't mean

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.000 
southeast main is down so you can't mean
it

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010 
it

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.060 
it
the<00:07:11.010> same<00:07:11.250> is<00:07:11.430> for<00:07:11.730> SW<00:07:12.540> you<00:07:12.720> and<00:07:12.990> swd<00:07:13.590> which<00:07:13.830> is

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
the same is for SW you and swd which is

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.320 
the same is for SW you and swd which is
the<00:07:14.340> south<00:07:14.790> west<00:07:15.150> main<00:07:15.450> and<00:07:15.920> any<00:07:16.920> you<00:07:17.850> and<00:07:18.180> any

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
the south west main and any you and any

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.140 
the south west main and any you and any
the

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
the

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.090 
the
as<00:07:19.210> the<00:07:19.540> Northeast<00:07:20.350> Maine<00:07:20.620> which<00:07:20.890> is

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
as the Northeast Maine which is

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.710 
as the Northeast Maine which is
basically<00:07:21.670> the<00:07:21.880> reserve<00:07:22.180> when<00:07:22.450> the<00:07:22.570> both

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
basically the reserve when the both

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.170 
basically the reserve when the both
South<00:07:23.110> mains<00:07:23.380> are<00:07:23.590> down<00:07:23.790> the<00:07:24.790> Northeast

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
South mains are down the Northeast

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.970 
South mains are down the Northeast
goldmine<00:07:25.750> is<00:07:25.900> basically<00:07:26.320> only<00:07:26.560> used<00:07:26.800> as<00:07:26.950> a

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:26.980 
goldmine is basically only used as a

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.980 
goldmine is basically only used as a
backup<00:07:27.310> when<00:07:27.700> both<00:07:27.970> the<00:07:28.240> South<00:07:28.480> Gold<00:07:28.780> lanes

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
backup when both the South Gold lanes

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.830 
backup when both the South Gold lanes
are<00:07:29.170> down<00:07:30.060> you<00:07:31.060> don't<00:07:31.240> actually<00:07:31.390> have<00:07:31.540> the

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 
are down you don't actually have the

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.870 
are down you don't actually have the
Maine<00:07:31.990> the<00:07:32.140> Northeast<00:07:32.620> Maine<00:07:32.950> in<00:07:33.130> fact<00:07:33.640> I<00:07:33.820> only

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
Maine the Northeast Maine in fact I only

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.970 
Maine the Northeast Maine in fact I only
recommend<00:07:34.480> doing<00:07:34.840> it<00:07:35.020> if<00:07:35.170> you<00:07:35.410> have<00:07:35.620> a<00:07:35.650> beast

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980 
recommend doing it if you have a beast

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.080 
recommend doing it if you have a beast
of<00:07:36.100> burden<00:07:36.160> familiar

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
of burden familiar

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.480 
of burden familiar
otherwise<00:07:37.840> I'd<00:07:38.290> suggest<00:07:38.740> just<00:07:39.040> meaning<00:07:39.370> the

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490 
otherwise I'd suggest just meaning the

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.370 
otherwise I'd suggest just meaning the
call<00:07:39.700> in<00:07:40.000> the<00:07:40.120> southern<00:07:40.540> pipe<00:07:40.780> so<00:07:41.110> you<00:07:41.230> can

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.380 
call in the southern pipe so you can

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.710 
call in the southern pipe so you can
keep<00:07:41.590> the<00:07:41.950> South<00:07:42.460> Gould<00:07:42.790> mains<00:07:43.030> and<00:07:43.270> view<00:07:43.540> for

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 
keep the South Gould mains and view for

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.020 
keep the South Gould mains and view for
when<00:07:43.840> they're<00:07:43.960> back<00:07:44.110> up<00:07:44.140> again<00:07:44.880> and<00:07:45.880> that

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.030 
when they're back up again and that

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.700 
when they're back up again and that
pretty<00:07:46.330> much<00:07:46.450> brings<00:07:46.570> me<00:07:47.020> to<00:07:47.170> the<00:07:47.260> end<00:07:47.290> of<00:07:47.590> the

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.710 
pretty much brings me to the end of the

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.790 
pretty much brings me to the end of the
video<00:07:48.010> I<00:07:48.190> think<00:07:48.790> I've<00:07:48.940> covered<00:07:49.210> everything
