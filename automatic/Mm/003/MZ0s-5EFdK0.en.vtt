I've<00:01:59.740> actually<00:01:59.979> decided<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.580> start<00:02:00.790> doing<00:02:02.160> is

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
I've actually decided to start doing is

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.750 
I've actually decided to start doing is
not<00:02:04.510> editing<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.320> swearing<00:02:05.680> out<00:02:05.770> he<00:02:06.550> was<00:02:06.640> kind

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
not editing the swearing out he was kind

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.100 
not editing the swearing out he was kind
of<00:02:06.850> surprised<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.390> left<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.900> last

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
of surprised that I left it in the last

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.630 
of surprised that I left it in the last
video<00:02:08.290> but<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:09.070> think<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:11.590> should<00:02:12.190> know<00:02:12.340> how

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
video but I think he should know how

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.250 
video but I think he should know how
much<00:02:12.820> he<00:02:12.970> swears<00:02:13.210> because<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.540> think<00:02:13.810> he<00:02:13.930> x<00:02:14.050> just

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
much he swears because I think he x just

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.050 
much he swears because I think he x just
was<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> lot<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.010> it's<00:02:15.340> one<00:02:15.489> thing<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.700> swear<00:02:16.030> a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
was a lot and it's one thing to swear a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.850 
was a lot and it's one thing to swear a
lot<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.450> own<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:17.410> how<00:02:17.530> my<00:02:17.650> girl

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
lot and own it like how my girl

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.530 
lot and own it like how my girl
high-maintenance<00:02:18.220> she<00:02:18.670> has<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.880> sailor<00:02:19.390> mouth

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
high-maintenance she has a sailor mouth

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.050 
high-maintenance she has a sailor mouth
but<00:02:19.959> she<00:02:19.989> owns<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.890> love<00:02:21.250> her<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.489> it's<00:02:21.850> part

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
but she owns it I love her and it's part

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.330 
but she owns it I love her and it's part
of<00:02:22.150> her<00:02:22.270> personality<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.590> boy<00:02:23.739> thinks<00:02:24.280> he

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
of her personality but the boy thinks he

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.880 
of her personality but the boy thinks he
doesn't<00:02:24.670> swear<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> lot<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:28.050> think<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.290> if

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
doesn't swear a lot so I think that if

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.410 
doesn't swear a lot so I think that if
he<00:02:30.310> doesn't<00:02:30.580> think<00:02:30.670> he<00:02:30.760> smells<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.150> he

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
he doesn't think he smells like he

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.270 
he doesn't think he smells like he
should<00:02:31.630> see<00:02:31.900> himself<00:02:32.380> swearing<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.130> maybe

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
should see himself swearing and maybe

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.060 
should see himself swearing and maybe
that<00:02:33.550> would<00:02:34.020> make<00:02:35.020> him<00:02:35.140> acknowledge<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.800> for

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
that would make him acknowledge this for

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.590 
that would make him acknowledge this for
his<00:02:36.160> life<00:02:36.370> he<00:02:36.610> doesn't<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.239> way<00:02:37.390> he

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
his life he doesn't like it that way he

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.150 
his life he doesn't like it that way he
could<00:02:37.690> change<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.140> or<00:02:38.290> if<00:02:38.350> he<00:02:38.440> does<00:02:38.620> like<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:39.040> he

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
could change it or if he does like it he

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.890 
could change it or if he does like it he
can<00:02:39.190> own<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.489> right<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:41.260> my<00:02:41.470> theory<00:02:42.900> I'm
