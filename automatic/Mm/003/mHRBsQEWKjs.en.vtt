I<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.970> have<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> measure<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.980> every

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I just have to measure so that every

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.120 
I just have to measure so that every
brush<00:00:59.850> fits<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.690> between<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.710> elastic

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
brush fits in between those two elastic

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.520 
brush fits in between those two elastic
bands<00:01:03.710> okay<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.979> now<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.399> start<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
bands okay so now we can start I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
bands okay so now we can start I
so<00:01:07.530> first<00:01:07.770> call<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.520> elastic<00:01:08.970> band<00:01:09.360> through

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
so first call the elastic band through

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.530 
so first call the elastic band through
the<00:01:09.960> first<00:01:10.229> two<00:01:10.680> well<00:01:11.630> that<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.869> sticks<00:01:13.649> and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
the first two well that two sticks and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.840 
the first two well that two sticks and
put<00:01:15.540> some<00:01:15.750> glue<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.850> flip

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
put some glue on it and then just flip

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
put some glue on it and then just flip
it<00:01:17.880> over<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.540> flat<00:01:18.750> elastic<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.409> attitude<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it over it flat elastic over attitude so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.610 
it over it flat elastic over attitude so
that<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.610> closed<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.390> nice<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.990> secure<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.860 

after<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.189> just<00:03:14.700> made<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.209> same<00:03:15.450> thing

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
after this I just made the same thing

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.770 
after this I just made the same thing
the<00:03:16.349> same<00:03:16.530> exact<00:03:16.920> thing<00:03:17.189> for<00:03:17.219> the<00:03:17.969> lower<00:03:18.359> part

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
the same exact thing for the lower part

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.140 
the same exact thing for the lower part
and<00:03:19.079> but<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:19.829> time<00:03:20.069> I<00:03:20.219> did<00:03:20.489> not<00:03:20.760> choose<00:03:21.090> to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
and but this time I did not choose to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.530 
and but this time I did not choose to
only<00:03:21.810> use<00:03:22.499> like<00:03:22.829> two<00:03:23.189> parts<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.730> between<00:03:24.030> every

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
only use like two parts in between every

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.369 
only use like two parts in between every
other<00:03:25.219> brush<00:03:26.219> because<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.420> brushes<00:03:27.840> tend<00:03:28.290> to

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
other brush because the brushes tend to

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.550 
other brush because the brushes tend to
get<00:03:28.499> smaller<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.219> the<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.329> lower<00:03:31.139> part<00:03:31.469> so

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
get smaller and the on the lower part so

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.399 
get smaller and the on the lower part so
I<00:03:31.769> had<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.219> like<00:03:32.430> put<00:03:32.760> more<00:03:33.180> bars<00:03:33.689> in<00:03:34.049> between

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
I had to like put more bars in between

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.839 
I had to like put more bars in between
so<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.650> everything<00:03:35.250> fits<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.760> everything

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
so that everything fits and everything

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.270 
so that everything fits and everything
is<00:03:36.329> nice<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.659> secure<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.260> nothing<00:03:37.889> folds<00:03:38.189> out

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
is nice and secure and nothing folds out

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.759 
is nice and secure and nothing folds out
and<00:03:38.489> there's<00:03:39.000> not<00:03:39.269> too<00:03:39.450> much<00:03:39.540> space<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.109> if

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
and there's not too much space and if

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.619 
and there's not too much space and if
you've<00:03:40.950> got<00:03:41.189> this<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.939> we<00:03:42.120> should<00:03:42.299> end<00:03:42.510> up

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
you've got this that we should end up

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:43.970 
you've got this that we should end up
with<00:03:42.689> something<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.379> looks<00:03:43.620> like<00:03:43.709> this

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
with something that looks like this

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.129 
with something that looks like this
every<00:03:44.489> brush<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.939> secured<00:03:45.389> every<00:03:45.780> brush<00:03:45.989> is

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
it well I've used two ribbons

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.920 
it well I've used two ribbons
because<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.069> use<00:03:56.430> two<00:03:56.730> elastic<00:03:57.239> bands<00:03:57.599> just<00:03:57.780> to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
because I use two elastic bands just to

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.069 
because I use two elastic bands just to
cover<00:03:58.169> them<00:03:58.469> up<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.889> I<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.760> put<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.329> ribbon

since<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.699> have<00:04:20.910> two<00:04:21.120> elastics<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.720> wanted<00:04:21.959> to

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
since I have two elastics I wanted to

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.020

same<00:04:26.879> thing<00:04:27.569> as<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.810> did<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.139> first<00:04:28.460> ribbon

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
same thing as I did for the first ribbon

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.559 
same thing as I did for the first ribbon
I<00:04:29.669> just<00:04:30.090> measured<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:31.110> out<00:04:31.879> glued<00:04:32.879> it<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.150> and
