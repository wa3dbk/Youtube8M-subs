the<00:02:55.930> punch<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.409> a<00:02:56.470> corkscrew<00:02:57.040> punch<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:59.019> know

the punch as a corkscrew punch you know
Ruddock<00:03:00.909> said<00:03:01.450> he<00:03:01.540> devised<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.230> punch

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
Ruddock said he devised the punch

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.860 
Ruddock said he devised the punch
because<00:03:04.709> he<00:03:05.709> was<00:03:05.829> fighting<00:03:06.220> somebody<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.180> he

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
because he was fighting somebody and he

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.069 
because he was fighting somebody and he
realized<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:10.150> normal<00:03:10.569> hook<00:03:10.780> called<00:03:11.019> a

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
realized that the normal hook called a

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.050 
realized that the normal hook called a
normal<00:03:11.409> uppercut<00:03:11.950> wouldn't<00:03:12.489> work<00:03:12.639> against

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
normal uppercut wouldn't work against

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.520 
normal uppercut wouldn't work against
him<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.560> he<00:03:14.560> figured<00:03:15.010> by<00:03:16.230> starting<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.319> shot

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
him so he figured by starting the shot

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.170 
him so he figured by starting the shot
one<00:03:17.739> way<00:03:17.919> and<00:03:18.099> then<00:03:18.190> changing<00:03:18.669> the<00:03:18.699> angle<00:03:18.940> of

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
one way and then changing the angle of

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.059 
one way and then changing the angle of
it<00:03:19.329> he'd<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:19.900> more<00:03:20.290> effective<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:23.069> rather

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
it he'd be more effective and rather

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.330 
it he'd be more effective and rather
