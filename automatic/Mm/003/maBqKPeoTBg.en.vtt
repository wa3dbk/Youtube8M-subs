00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
as the trees are nice shoppable so you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
as the trees are nice shoppable so you
can<00:01:52.770> mold<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.610> landscape<00:01:54.120> more<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.780> your

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
can mold the landscape more to your

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
can mold the landscape more to your
liking<00:01:56.090> get<00:01:57.090> log<00:01:58.250> from<00:01:59.250> chopping<00:01:59.520> trees<00:01:59.760> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
liking get log from chopping trees you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
liking get log from chopping trees you
see<00:02:00.150> over<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> left<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.550> there's<00:02:02.550> also

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
see over the left there and there's also

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
see over the left there and there's also
a<00:02:02.820> rich<00:02:03.300> material<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:03.960> underneath<00:02:04.200> tree<00:02:04.500> is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a rich material now underneath tree is
