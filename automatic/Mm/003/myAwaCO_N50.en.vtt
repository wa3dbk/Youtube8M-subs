00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
overcome in many cases it still takes

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.939 
overcome in many cases it still takes
time<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:32.639> know<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:33.820> it<00:05:33.880> takes<00:05:34.060> an<00:05:34.180> emotional

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
time you know and it takes an emotional
