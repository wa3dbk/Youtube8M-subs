00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone without being mania things that 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.799
 we are in another video tutorial word 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.379
 this time I want to show you how to do it 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.049
 or how it is best customized 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.139
 our weapon does not matter if you are a magician if 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.939
 you are a warrior if you are a rogue 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.410
 the same way but changing the 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.199
 base material 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.460
 if you are a magician or any other type or 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.339
 warrior too but you use the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 bar or any wooden weapon like 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.890
 an archer we have to go first to the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.860
 carpentry we will have to go to the mountains 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.240
 that we see here that you put out we give him and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.350
 we look for in formulas the wood we will pass 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.870
 the rough wooden logs to wood a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.340
 refined wooden cubes here you see how 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.560
 they go down the trunks that are these 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.570
 and they are going to wooden cubes 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.120
 We will give until we finish refining 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.850
 the all 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.670
 every weapon we want can 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.280
 customize or customize only you 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.830
 they will be able to add 32 more cubes than 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.770
 they have so it can not be done either 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.470
 a big change but it is true 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.270
 that we can give our touch 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.240
 after refining all the cubes of 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.280
 wood we go back to the smithy and we have 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.610
 that go to the rating table that you see that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 It is rectangular and with several with several 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.710
 tools over like a hammer 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.020
 etcetera there we look for our weapon for 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.590
 that we want to customize in my case 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.360
 will be the magician's staff and click 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.479
 left on that weapon to give 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.509
 selections if we give the central button 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.600
 from the mouse to the wheel we keep it 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.880
 pressed, we can turn and see all the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.430
 prospects of the weapon in 3-d by 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.310
 supposed 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.040
 and we can add cubes here you see how 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.230
 in the upper corner you can see all the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.810
 materials that you will have available for 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.160
 customize that weapon is to be of 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.400
 only wood could be added 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.610
 wood wooden cubes but if outside 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.869
 Iron can be added as much gold as 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.970
 emerald silver and so on here you see how 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.870
 I add some cubes I try to play a 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.000
 little with its shape but especially for 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.500
 that you see then aesthetically a change 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.440
 and you can notice that it has been customized 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.020
 the weapon even if wooden cubes are 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.750
 will see in gray I do not know if it is a failure of 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.820
 textures of the game or simply that the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.540
 have wanted to leave as well but hey the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.760
 I'm adding to the sheet that has my 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.250
 cane so that you can see a little 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.190
 better personalization 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.420
 see sideways as if it is quite noticeable 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.980
 see a small crest and good here 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.900
 We give at the same time to open our 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.790
 inventory again we look for the section 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.410
 of weapons and we equip ourselves with 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.640
 our sword cost or whatever you want 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.690
 Here you see how it looks on top of the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.100
 change sheet customization 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.620
 you see that now it has more cubes added 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.630
 and aesthetically good if you change it later 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.820
 its functions and what it comes from doing 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.070
 attack power etcetera not what 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.980
 modify for nothing simply is 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.260
 aesthetic and good for those who have 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.710
 iron weapons instead of doing the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.600
 first step wants to go to the quinterÃ­a what 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.350
 what you have to do is in the same 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.440
 smithy you look for the smelting furnace 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.790
 and melt the metal you want you see how 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.530
 at my level 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.530
 it only leaves us what is iron 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.150
 silver and gold but later you can 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.510
 melt precious stones like is the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.990
 emerald ruby sapphire and so on 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.460
 crafting and then follow the steps 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.710
 previously said with the weapon of 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.620
 wood I hope you liked this
