will<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:51.420> aspect<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> combat

will have this aspect of the combat
system<00:00:52.739> works<00:00:53.100> pretty<00:00:53.370> well

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
system works pretty well

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.090 
system works pretty well
unfortunately<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.109> magic<00:00:55.500> system<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
unfortunately the magic system is a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.759 
unfortunately the magic system is a
letdown<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.840> adventure<00:00:58.379> through<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
letdown as you adventure through the

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.400 
letdown as you adventure through the
game<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.699> collect<00:00:59.879> magical<00:01:00.480> cards<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
game we will collect magical cards that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.009 
game we will collect magical cards that
when<00:01:01.590> used<00:01:01.949> perform<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> associated<00:01:03.660> spell

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
when used perform the associated spell

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.859 
when used perform the associated spell
the<00:01:04.830> downside<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.759> all<00:01:06.149> characters

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the downside is that all characters

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.710 
the downside is that all characters
share<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> same<00:01:07.470> mana<00:01:07.770> pool<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:08.460> core<00:01:09.149> energy

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
share the same mana pool or core energy

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.749 
share the same mana pool or core energy
as<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.259> called<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> game<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.399> only<00:01:11.580> way

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
as it's called in this game the only way

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.820 
as it's called in this game the only way
to<00:01:11.820> increase<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.600> pool<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.500> equipment

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to increase this pool is with equipment

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.950 
to increase this pool is with equipment
upgrades<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:15.030> means<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.750> first

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
upgrades this means that for the first

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
upgrades this means that for the first
half<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> game<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.250> can't<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.700> use

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
half of the game you can't really use

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
half of the game you can't really use
magic<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:19.050> because<00:01:19.289> you<00:01:19.560> simply

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
magic all that much because you simply

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.090 
magic all that much because you simply
don't<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.130> enough<00:01:20.250> energy<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
don't have enough energy to use it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.430 
don't have enough energy to use it
all<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.429> said<00:01:23.759> combat<00:01:24.750> does<00:01:24.989> get<00:01:25.229> pretty

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
all that said combat does get pretty

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.949
