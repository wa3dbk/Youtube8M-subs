00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.000
 some showed me the two made the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.719
 its most important technical evolution 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.430
 finally leaves the old man 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.340
 two- cylinder two air valves in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 favor the same close of origin 1198 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.029
 liquid cooled with distribution 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.130
 double valve shaft four valves per 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.230
 cylinder and in the 11-degree version 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.210
 that of the multistrada has 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 further modified to dispense more 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 pair at the bottom is completely 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.079
 electronic controlled ride by 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.420
 wire offering three riding mode war mounts 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.820
 the city ​​with the 100 horses delivery 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.059
 soft ads and traction controls 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.160
 set for maximum security 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.590
 touring full power delivery more 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.860
 strong abs and traction control 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.199
 set to average full sport values 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 power and decisive abs delivery 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.140
 traction control set for the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.300
 sports driving 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 the exhibition is available in two versions 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 both have the same engine and le 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.229
 same functions as the electronics on 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.290
 basic version the power of 135 horses 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.060
 on the version if the top of the range yes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.159
 reaches 145 horses 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.740
 the version s also the suspensions 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.620
 ohlins the same braking system 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.080
 of the afa legal and lightened circles 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.630
 and it is recognized by the silencers say 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.310
 the front fender in carbon la 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.320
 death was a new chassis with the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.910
 bearing motor in panigale style a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.380
 extremely steel trellis 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.220
 compact in a new frame 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980
 rear 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.330
 the cycling odds also change 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.100
 modified to ensure stability 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.750
 to ensure easy handling e 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.480
 center of gravity has been moved lower 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.210
 and further back the tires are the pirelli 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.400
 red diablo ii for both beyond 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 to aesthetics and technique a job 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.220
 very important was accomplished in 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.410
 comfort theme 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 there is a lot of space on board sel is more like 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.520
 the well padded the highest handlebar is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.650
 set back and the tank also one 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.710
 greater capacity contains 4 liters in 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.710
 more 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.100
 and now let's see how this new is going 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.870
 monster for our test we have a 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.870
 available the top of the range version 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.700
 1200 s 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.650
 first they select riding mode 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.170
 the urban and let's see how we drive in 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.420
 city ​​the testastretta in this case 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.400
 limited to 100 horses ie power e 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410
 the same as the old show that 1100 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
 promoter responds so much more 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 sweet and so it's easy to drive too 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.620
 for a novice going for a walk the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.810
 it shows like a bruised breed horse 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.880
 below and 2,500 turns where there is some 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.130
 strange a little price to pay for 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.960
 have such an important twin but 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.420
 driving is easy but cycling and 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.810
 agile balanced and is comfortable and tasty 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.980
 walking also in pairs we pass now 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.980
 riding mode turin 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.360
 the power is the maximum in this 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.060
 case 145 horses but up to 6,000 rpm 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.560
 the supply does not create difficulties e 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.629
 so you can walk safely 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.170
 enjoying the view without tossing 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.170
 the passenger 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.569
 the agile but balanced chassis safe 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.240
 and precise and braking is powerful 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.500
 in addition always controlled by the said in 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.570
 tour in you can also entertain 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.620
 a lot pushing the vote regimes more 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.090
 high 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.950
 in this case, however, it is better to get off 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.810
 the passenger because the thrust is high 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.800
 remarkable and the guide begins to become 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.800
 quite challenging 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.550
 then we conclude our test 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.550
 passing sports 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.630
 the exhibit is in the best condition 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.860
 extreme the engine delivers full power 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.870
 responds directly 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.390
 to the accelerator the control of 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.250
 traction are minimally invasive compared to 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.290
 mo of flowers the difference is felt in the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.210
 engine response that is much more ready 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.310
 at the controls and the best if it keeps working 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.740
 at the highest regimes from 6,000 to 8,000 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.150
 rides driving so the move becomes 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.340
 quite challenging because 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.440
 Performance is the real sports 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.299
 curves fall on you very fast the 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.519
 the braking is very reactive 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.350
 decided to take this step 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.300
 serves concentration experience is 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.160
 however yes and very often over the 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.290
 limit granted record we are there 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.300
 could have fun today because the road 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.530
 a fortune that had been closed on purpose 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.530
 but it almost never happens
