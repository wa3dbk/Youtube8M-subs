00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.480
 nobody told you that video games 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.639
 I rot in your brain because today I'm going to 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.490
 deny that stupidity by demonstrating 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.400
 advantages of playing video games well 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.439
 let's start the video games have both 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 advantages as disadvantages but the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.699
 advantages help a lot in the lives of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 people one of the most advantages 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.240
 important is that people who 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.250
 they play video games they can do 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.679
 around five things at a time without 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 getting confused helps a lot at work 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.210
 while serving a client and receiving 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.469
 another partner while writing down the data 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.030
 of the other client without error 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.460
 pay attention to important details 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 in many things among them the school 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 while the other people forget a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.430
 indirectly from the teacher and others 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.899
 even these people understand 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 can see through the words 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 decipher what you mean and do not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.680

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.809
 apply it have better memory this is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 from personal experience all my 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 friends and even adults that I know 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.430
 they forget things 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.440
 but they did not do the day before 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930

 that are credible enough to 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.660

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.030
 disadvantages that everyone has already told us 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.549

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.519
 aspects of the lives of people with 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.799

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.299
