slide<00:02:00.060> 25<00:02:01.100> visited<00:02:02.100> twice<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.140> back

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
slide 25 visited twice I and then back

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
slide 25 visited twice I and then back
to<00:02:04.409> throw<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.890> open<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.700> think

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to throw and then it to open but I think

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.969 
to throw and then it to open but I think
that's<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> slide<00:02:09.690> part<00:02:10.020> comes<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that's when the slide part comes in and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.870 
that's when the slide part comes in and
he<00:02:11.039> does<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.720> Jack<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.350> named<00:02:13.880> little
