00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.889
 I have to say I was not like that for a long time 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.690
 Loved a le because you have 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 quite a lot of different colors 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.150
 I think it's five years old 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.980

 edition gives and I think it's right 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 awesome the meat lipstick and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.189
 nail polish are coordinated 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.219
 that's what it does to me 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.469
 it's just perfect the whole look so 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 that's really something very rare 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.090
 you do not have that in this one either 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.780
 beautiful 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.489
 you are already thinking about a shift 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.739
 well seems to have a bit of 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.420
 Nail through what you can but from afar 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.189
 layer you are bomb can you really 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.229
 Absolutely not say the finish is very 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.420
 I am very tall and very well 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.400
 So the media shine after that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 wonderful and I have no 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.920
 I just always took it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.360
 very very well chosen with a lot 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 love I think it has to be synonymous times 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 saying 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.420
 and yes we can already see I wear 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.970
 as always all colors on my nails 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.390
 I will always be the same 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.310
 start with this pack with pinky 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.710
 Saxony all the color popped right 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.320
 or so what do you say i'm simple 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.960
 only very excited patrice has very often 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.969
 You have to get pink in san limited edition 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.680
 already to say but the pink tones 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690
 I always think they are very beautiful too 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.330
 very much in demand 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.310
 So I think the class as I said 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.930
 also see i do not know if you are in 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.569
 can recognize gloss 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.940
 I think the borders are scary 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.340
 I really great and super super great 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.590

 Here is a beautiful color now 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.030
 a little bit darker, but not much 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.890

 You can always wear it very much 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 beautiful very very elegant that is for me 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.860

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.750
 of these three and I can give you that 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.640

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.820
 I also like it very much 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.209
 Of course I have a favorite again 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.610
 I just wear the color co2 with 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.799
 popular is the dark throne of the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.130
 both as I said today on mine 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.019
 lips 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.000
 I have to say the color is in itself 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.739
 really very nice only I think so 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.820
 personally she just does not stand 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 that's why I would have the 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.510
 probably not bought covers but 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.150
 Great as you can see here as well 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.959

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.160
 my case because I just think the 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.570
 steady 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.030
 good an absolutely brilliant sound is this 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.240
 here I have him already yesterday 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.210
 worn and it is a beautiful 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.190
 I love you the great thing about this is 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.930
 just you can do it with a layer 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.959
 Apply then I have just as easily 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.970
 They do on the lips and as soon as the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.650
 like this story on mine 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.340
 you see, you really have one 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.230
 strong great sound so he is both 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.120
 suitable for everyday use as well as for the evening 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.930
 for the party anyway for the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.630
 leisure 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.040
 that's really great and I can do that 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.800
 you really recommend that looks 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.710
 really nice and yes 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.320
 absolute recommendation on my part 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.630
 tin is in my packet with la 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:54.060
 danza this is the color 10 01 with chery 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.190
 Also a very great sound would be 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.500
 here you see him also michael stich 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.590
 I'm also wearing cheeks today 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.080
 Hope you see a little something 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.670
 exactly so you see each one here 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.050
 and then they are together 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.970
 gequatscht 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.840
 I have to say it reminds me so 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.330
 bit to the patrice walking royals 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.310
 I had also introduced you and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.290
 so this color changes me a lot 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.770
 strong then the lipstick reminds 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.270
 That's very strong for me but great 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.220
 if you are really looking for 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.730
 such colors also on the cheeks 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.770
 Here you see then yes a look 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.990
 The likes of me are for three euros 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.690
 99, the price is also completely okay 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.860
 because they are very well pigmented and 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.720
 then you really have to be careful too 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.630
 that is not surprising therefore it acts 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.970
 really only very minimal in the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.310
 Clean place and then apply 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.900
 very good blind and yes I think 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.540
 really nice 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.520
 in this it is full of a coupe 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.590
 give and that will definitely be in mine 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.900
 shopping head wander because I have 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.240
 already a capri out of a crisis limited 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.730
 edition and I use no other 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.840
 more if that's the case 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.240
 should then yes I have to necessarily 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.930
 So these are really very high quality 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.940
 Well 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.560
 and otherwise you will see again 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.090
 what 's all there is there 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.590
 really really great 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.120
 I 'll be there again 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.220
 look around clearly 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.139
 and then I hope you have this video 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.729
 please and see you next time 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.660
 video is good again 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.660
 Hello
