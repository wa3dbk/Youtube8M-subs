00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.460 
so you can see I'll take the mic off
there<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.300> got<00:05:16.420> multiple<00:05:16.870> placements<00:05:17.410> we

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
there so you got multiple placements we

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.440 
there so you got multiple placements we
can<00:05:17.590> put<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.890> GoPro<00:05:18.100> obviously<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.000> GoPro

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
can put that GoPro obviously the GoPro

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
and the wide field of view you're

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.290 
and the wide field of view you're
probably<00:05:20.710> gonna<00:05:20.890> need<00:05:20.950> to<00:05:21.070> adjust<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.550> so

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
probably gonna need to adjust that so

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.700 
probably gonna need to adjust that so
that<00:05:22.420> you<00:05:22.480> don't<00:05:22.510> capture<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.140> top<00:05:23.350> part<00:05:23.650> but

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
that you don't capture the top part but

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.790 
that you don't capture the top part but
just<00:05:24.040> depends<00:05:24.430> on<00:05:24.490> what<00:05:24.850> part<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:25.870> your<00:05:26.620> life

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
just depends on what part of your life

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.050 
just depends on what part of your life
you're<00:05:27.040> filming<00:05:27.280> now<00:05:27.520> whether<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:27.760> be<00:05:27.790> outside
