00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 the first thing was to visit the station with 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.160
 strains that is a remodeling of the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.599
 station which of course comprises a 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.820
 comprehensive plan enhancement of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.690
 all the stations of the general line 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.940
 San Martin 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.230
 on Wednesday we will surely be 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.930
 inaugurating with the president of the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.119
 republic this first line totally 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.640
 renewed we are putting the 160 cars 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.820
 new to operate from the week 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.890
 next expressing a new service that 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.989
 of course we take the opportunity to ask 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.450
 users first apologies for all 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.829
 the inconveniences of a process 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.210
 of renewal like the one we're 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.879
 carrying forward with a service that 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.860
 is underway and on the other hand ask 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.030
 that they take care of this great 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.829
 effort that has been made since the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.570
 national government for the acquisition 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.399
 of the rolling stock and especially 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.440
 taking into account this line 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.960
 railway so important for thousands and 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.699
 thousands of passengers from this entire region 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.860
 who use it to go every day 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.420
 to work 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.800
 remodeling works in all 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.980
 platforms and what will be the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.210
 following stages we believe that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.400
 mid-July should be renovated 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.980
 all seasons and good and those 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.250
 cars are the 160 cars are new 0km 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.830
 and 24 new locomotives so it's a 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.000
 completely renovated service and by 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.310
 of course we are passing quickly 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.330
 already simultaneously with the renovation 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.810
 complete also of the ambient lines 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.150
 a new Argentine history there is no 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.100
 no doubt look there is a before and a 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.020
 then this is a pending debt that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.520
 had the national government and we 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.740
 we make the commitment with the president 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.690
 to settle it with the president and with the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.340
 thousands and thousands of Argentines who dreamed 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.160
 for many years that rail 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.540
 come back to be let's say the means of 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.310
 most important transport of the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.009
 Argentina, both passengers and 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.130
 load we are we have acquired more than 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.910
 1,200 cars 0km we are renewing all 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.040
 the lines of the metropolitan area 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.360
 we finished sanmartÃ­n next week 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.460
 We are taking a process of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.920
 complete renovation on the branch in 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.450
 the three branches of the miter in the rock 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.450
 more electrification of sea rocks 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.610
 silver rose 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.380
 which includes not only material 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.410
 rolling but the enhancement of all 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.640
 the roads as well as the renovation 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.910
 of stations and new systems of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.160
 pointing that manages the ministry 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.750
 the railways but also the dni 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.700
 that also here then it stops 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.080
 is doing this operative good this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.380
 it is further proof that when there is a 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.120
 competent state committed the state 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.370
 it can give a very good response as has 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.349
 this great identity 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.540
 achievement that we have made so that all 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.040
 Argentines can make the process of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.250
 Dni absolutely a simple way 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.380
 Very fast practice and a very low cost 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.060
 There are 36 million Argentines who 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.799
 they made new national document of 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.390
 identity and we hope that the rest will 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.680
 make the coffee end of the year since starting 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.440
 from the first of January next year 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.090
 who has the old document in this 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.810
 I want to be clear notepad enrollment 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.640
 civic notebook or the green document does not 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.470
 it's going to serve you more so it's important 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.959
 that all approach the centers of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.660
 documentation there are more than 3200 centers in 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.730
 the country or to these mobile units that is 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.230
 a way to bring the state closer to a 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.910
 service as essential as is the right 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.480
 to the identity make the documents 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.480
 nation entity
