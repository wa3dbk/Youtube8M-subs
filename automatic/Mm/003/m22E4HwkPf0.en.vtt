what you see some of the other ones when
it's<00:02:48.620> being<00:02:48.830> assembled<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.820> simply<00:02:50.209> put<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
it's being assembled you simply put the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.949 
it's being assembled you simply put the
pieces<00:02:51.380> in<00:02:52.060> put<00:02:53.060> them<00:02:53.180> toward<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> outside

pieces in put them toward the outside
you<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.350> see<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.500> bevel<00:02:54.860> here<00:02:55.070> tab<00:02:55.820> in<00:02:56.030> slot

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
you can see a bevel here tab in slot

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.850 
you can see a bevel here tab in slot
slide<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.040> up<00:02:58.190> flush<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.730> top<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
slide it up flush to the top so that you

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.960 
slide it up flush to the top so that you
got<00:03:01.040> your<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.310> when<00:03:04.459> you're<00:03:04.580> actually

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
got your and when you're actually

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.040 
got your and when you're actually
assembling<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.750> would<00:03:05.870> put<00:03:06.019> some

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
assembling it you would put some

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.590 
assembling it you would put some
caulking<00:03:06.590> first

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
caulking first

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.720 
caulking first
once<00:03:08.600> that's<00:03:08.810> done

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.710 

this<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> little<00:03:12.720> bit<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.989> tricky<00:03:13.349> part

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.350 

kind<00:03:16.320> of<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.430> wiggle<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.910> around<00:03:17.970> a

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
kind of have to wiggle it around a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.630 
kind of have to wiggle it around a
little<00:03:18.480> bit<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.530> hard<00:03:19.800> be<00:03:20.280> careful

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
little bit that's not hard be careful

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.600 
little bit that's not hard be careful
not<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.790> pinch<00:03:21.030> your<00:03:21.210> fingers<00:03:21.470> but<00:03:22.470> once<00:03:22.680> that

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
not to pinch your fingers but once that

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.280 
not to pinch your fingers but once that
is<00:03:23.670> done<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.390> house<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.840> essentially

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
is done the house is essentially

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.560 
is done the house is essentially
assembled<00:03:25.920> at<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.550> point<00:03:26.820> all<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.300> need<00:03:27.480> to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
assembled at this point all you need to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.040 
assembled at this point all you need to
do<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.870> do<00:03:27.990> your<00:03:28.020> pre-drill<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.070> your<00:03:29.310> screws

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
do is do your pre-drill and your screws

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.680 
do is do your pre-drill and your screws
now<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:32.250> house<00:03:32.430> really<00:03:32.700> doesn't<00:03:33.120> require<00:03:33.330> as

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
now the house really doesn't require as

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.810 
now the house really doesn't require as
many<00:03:33.810> screws<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.560> they're<00:03:34.710> in<00:03:34.830> here<00:03:35.040> but<00:03:35.490> as<00:03:35.760> we

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
many screws as they're in here but as we

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.760 
many screws as they're in here but as we
started<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.510> do<00:03:36.630> kids<00:03:36.900> programs<00:03:37.350> we

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
started to do kids programs we

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.130 
started to do kids programs we
discovered<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:39.390> there<00:03:39.720> really<00:03:39.840> wasn't

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
discovered that there really wasn't

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.040 
discovered that there really wasn't
enough<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:40.890> them<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.160> do<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.360> by<00:03:42.540> adding<00:03:42.900> more

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
enough for them to do so by adding more

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.320 
enough for them to do so by adding more
screws<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.770> gave<00:03:43.950> them<00:03:44.130> more<00:03:44.310> activity<00:03:44.850> use

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
screws that gave them more activity use

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.500 
screws that gave them more activity use
a<00:03:45.360> simple<00:03:45.840> drill<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.920> expensive<00:03:50.460> right<00:03:51.360> down

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
a simple drill and expensive right down

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.180 
a simple drill and expensive right down
to<00:03:51.720> drills<00:03:51.960> that<00:03:52.170> are<00:03:52.230> thirty<00:03:52.680> or<00:03:52.860> forty

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
to drills that are thirty or forty

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.980 
to drills that are thirty or forty
dollars<00:03:53.550> they<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.820> pick<00:03:54.090> up<00:03:54.270> if<00:03:54.630> they<00:03:54.810> don't

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
dollars they can pick up if they don't

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.050 
dollars they can pick up if they don't
happen<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.380> have<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.770> we<00:03:56.070> found<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.550> most

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
happen to have one we found that most

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.030 
happen to have one we found that most
homes<00:03:57.390> do<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.990> one<00:03:58.230> or<00:03:58.470> at<00:03:58.620> least<00:03:58.650> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
drills and they assemble the house

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.980

the screws in and you get the body of
the<00:04:15.060> house

and it would run water down inside the
house<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:46.900> after<00:04:47.860> some<00:04:48.070> thought<00:04:48.250> what<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.550> came

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
house so after some thought what I came

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.390 
house so after some thought what I came
up<00:04:49.000> with<00:04:49.240> was<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.600> folding<00:04:50.170> design<00:04:50.200> rather<00:04:51.100> than

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
up with was a folding design rather than

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.040 
up with was a folding design rather than
a<00:04:51.840> bevel<00:04:52.840> pea<00:04:54.060> best<00:04:55.060> way<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.270> do<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.660> is<00:04:55.930> to

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
a bevel pea best way to do this is to

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.040 
a bevel pea best way to do this is to
put<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.410> pieces<00:04:56.830> down<00:04:57.240> back-to-back<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:58.900> that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
put the pieces down back-to-back so that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.530 
put the pieces down back-to-back so that
the<00:04:59.140> peaks<00:04:59.350> are<00:04:59.500> going<00:04:59.740> up<00:04:59.920> and<00:05:00.520> then<00:05:01.240> all<00:05:01.390> you

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
the peaks are going up and then all you

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.350 
the peaks are going up and then all you
do<00:05:01.690> is<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:01.960> fold<00:05:02.200> it<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:03.700> makes<00:05:03.940> the

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
do is you fold it and that makes the

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.990 
do is you fold it and that makes the
peak<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.660> your<00:05:04.840> house<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:06.280> also<00:05:06.430> makes<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.910> a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
peak of your house it also makes it a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.870 
peak of your house it also makes it a
little<00:05:07.090> easier<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.750> assemble<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.320> panel's

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
little easier to assemble the panel's

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.570 
little easier to assemble the panel's
when<00:05:09.880> you're<00:05:10.030> putting<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:11.010> roof<00:05:12.010> on

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
when you're putting the roof on

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.150 
when you're putting the roof on
you<00:05:13.180> take<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.630> shorter<00:05:14.290> pieces<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:17.650> it's<00:05:17.800> just

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
you take the shorter pieces so it's just

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.420 
you take the shorter pieces so it's just
flush<00:05:18.660> with<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:19.810> here

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.060 

then<00:05:24.880> you<00:05:25.000> caught<00:05:25.240> this<00:05:25.450> piece<00:05:25.720> you<00:05:26.080> put<00:05:26.800> it<00:05:26.920> on

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
then you caught this piece you put it on

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.150 
then you caught this piece you put it on
the<00:05:27.250> same<00:05:27.430> way<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:28.570> what<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:28.900> end<00:05:29.080> up<00:05:29.230> with<00:05:29.290> is

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
the same way and what you end up with is

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.200 
the same way and what you end up with is
a<00:05:30.640> gap<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.540> is<00:05:31.660> sealed<00:05:32.020> would<00:05:32.260> call<00:05:33.060> even<00:05:34.060> if

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
a gap that is sealed would call even if

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.480 
a gap that is sealed would call even if
it<00:05:34.450> separates<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.380> little<00:05:35.410> bit<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:35.890> much<00:05:36.190> less

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
it separates a little bit is much less

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.460 
it separates a little bit is much less
likely<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.970> let<00:05:37.240> water<00:05:37.450> just<00:05:37.720> run<00:05:37.990> through<00:05:38.350> the

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
likely to let water just run through the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.600 
likely to let water just run through the
house<00:05:39.180> once<00:05:40.180> we<00:05:40.360> did<00:05:40.510> that<00:05:41.220> Malia<00:05:42.220> and<00:05:42.400> a

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
house once we did that Malia and a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.310 
house once we did that Malia and a
couple<00:05:42.790> of<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.000> biologist<00:05:43.690> we<00:05:43.840> sent<00:05:44.050> him<00:05:44.110> some

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
couple of a biologist we sent him some

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.680 
couple of a biologist we sent him some
kits<00:05:44.590> they<00:05:44.830> put<00:05:45.010> them<00:05:45.100> together<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:46.570> they

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
kits they put them together and they

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.320 
kits they put them together and they
were<00:05:46.750> able<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.140> certify<00:05:47.590> them<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.280> to<00:05:49.240> my

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
were able to certify them and to my

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.150 
were able to certify them and to my
knowledge<00:05:49.510> this<00:05:49.900> is<00:05:49.960> still<00:05:50.350> the<00:05:50.560> only<00:05:50.770> kit

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
knowledge this is still the only kit

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.120 
knowledge this is still the only kit

the<00:05:54.130> decorative<00:05:54.400> bad<00:05:54.730> I'd<00:05:54.940> mentioned<00:05:55.330> before

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
the decorative bad I'd mentioned before

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.710 
the decorative bad I'd mentioned before
there<00:05:56.260> are<00:05:56.290> two<00:05:56.950> small<00:05:57.520> nails<00:05:57.820> in<00:05:58.090> here<00:05:58.300> what

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
there are two small nails in here what

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.210 
there are two small nails in here what
we<00:05:58.920> let<00:05:59.920> them<00:06:00.070> know<00:06:00.220> they<00:06:00.400> need<00:06:00.550> to<00:06:00.670> do<00:06:00.820> is<00:06:01.660> to

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
we let them know they need to do is to

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.680 
we let them know they need to do is to
put<00:06:03.220> a<00:06:03.430> good<00:06:03.700> amount<00:06:03.910> of<00:06:04.030> caulk<00:06:04.270> on<00:06:04.420> the<00:06:04.540> back

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
put a good amount of caulk on the back

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.800 
put a good amount of caulk on the back
of<00:06:04.900> it<00:06:05.050> something<00:06:05.290> to<00:06:05.440> act<00:06:05.590> like<00:06:05.740> a<00:06:05.770> glue<00:06:06.810> push

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
of it something to act like a glue push

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.600 
of it something to act like a glue push
it<00:06:07.990> down<00:06:08.170> on<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.440> house<00:06:08.620> and<00:06:09.070> then<00:06:09.340> they<00:06:09.430> can

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
it down on the house and then they can

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.300 
it down on the house and then they can
take<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:09.940> two<00:06:10.090> now

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.640 

I<00:06:13.400> mentioned<00:06:14.360> before<00:06:14.420> originally<00:06:15.380> we<00:06:15.530> had

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
I mentioned before originally we had

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.470 
I mentioned before originally we had
thought<00:06:15.800> about<00:06:15.860> nailing<00:06:16.280> them<00:06:16.520> together<00:06:16.670> we

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
thought about nailing them together we

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.160 
thought about nailing them together we
learned<00:06:17.750> very<00:06:18.470> quickly<00:06:18.730> that<00:06:19.730> hammers<00:06:20.510> with<00:06:20.900> 8

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
learned very quickly that hammers with 8

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.500 
learned very quickly that hammers with 8
9<00:06:21.380> 10<00:06:21.560> year<00:06:21.740> olds<00:06:22.010> is<00:06:22.100> a<00:06:22.130> lot<00:06:22.430> worse<00:06:22.610> than<00:06:22.670> just

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
9 10 year olds is a lot worse than just

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.750 
9 10 year olds is a lot worse than just
a<00:06:23.690> drill<00:06:23.960> with<00:06:24.170> 8<00:06:24.320> 9<00:06:24.500> 10<00:06:24.680> year<00:06:24.860> olds<00:06:25.130> they<00:06:25.310> tend

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
a drill with 8 9 10 year olds they tend

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.220 
a drill with 8 9 10 year olds they tend
to<00:06:25.880> at<00:06:26.060> least<00:06:26.270> not<00:06:26.420> try<00:06:26.600> to<00:06:26.660> beat<00:06:26.840> each<00:06:26.870> other

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
to at least not try to beat each other

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.880 
to at least not try to beat each other
with<00:06:27.320> the<00:06:27.530> drills<00:06:29.260> that's<00:06:30.260> really<00:06:30.590> about<00:06:30.830> it

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
with the drills that's really about it

00:06:30.890 --> 00:07:08.040 
with the drills that's really about it
if<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.340> have<00:06:31.490> any<00:06:31.640> questions<00:06:32.090> let<00:06:32.330> me<00:06:32.390> know
