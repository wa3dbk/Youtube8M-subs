Easter Sports is a team sport and lots

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.570 
Easter Sports is a team sport and lots
of<00:00:45.620> running<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.250> both<00:00:47.059> keys<00:00:47.510> required<00:00:48.340> I'm<00:00:49.340> new

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
of running in both keys required I'm new

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.740 
of running in both keys required I'm new
to<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.790> school<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.269> was<00:00:50.390> joined<00:00:50.660> in

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
to the school and I was joined in

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.160 
to the school and I was joined in
January<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.730> what<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:52.760> saw<00:00:53.180> in<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.870> girls

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
January and what I saw in the girls

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.960 
January and what I saw in the girls
would<00:00:54.470> that<00:00:54.620> they<00:00:55.130> have<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:55.700> lot<00:00:55.910> of

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
would that they have a lot of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.680 
would that they have a lot of
determination<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:58.010> spirit<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:58.640> think

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
determination and that spirit I think

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.049 
determination and that spirit I think
put<00:00:59.690> them<00:00:59.809> true<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.320> what<00:01:01.130> we<00:01:01.700> did<00:01:01.850> was<00:01:02.030> just

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
put them true and what we did was just

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.719 
put them true and what we did was just
to<00:01:02.530> address<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.649> gaps<00:01:03.950> that<00:01:04.100> they<00:01:04.280> have<00:01:04.430> in

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
to address the gaps that they have in

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.880 
to address the gaps that they have in
the<00:01:04.940> mental<00:01:05.300> fitness<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.380> think<00:01:06.590> I

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
the mental fitness and I think I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.770 
the mental fitness and I think I
probably<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.550> worked<00:01:07.820> for<00:01:08.090> them<00:01:08.210> very<00:01:08.570> well

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
probably that worked for them very well

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.499 
probably that worked for them very well
as<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.860> said<00:01:09.920> they<00:01:10.220> have<00:01:10.250> guts

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
as I said they have guts

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.850 
as I said they have guts
they<00:01:11.720> have<00:01:12.009> determination<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:14.050> I<00:01:15.050> think<00:01:15.560> in

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
they have determination and I think in

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.790 
they have determination and I think in
terms<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.190> fitness<00:01:16.430> they<00:01:17.180> were<00:01:17.240> already<00:01:17.450> there

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
terms of fitness they were already there

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.690 
terms of fitness they were already there
except<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:18.860> maybe<00:01:19.479> at<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.690> match<00:01:21.140> level<00:01:21.500> and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
except that maybe at the match level and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.100 
except that maybe at the match level and
bigger<00:01:22.700> tournaments<00:01:22.970> like<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.420> they<00:01:23.930> need<00:01:24.080> a

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
bigger tournaments like that they need a

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.199 
bigger tournaments like that they need a
bit<00:01:24.350> more<00:01:24.380> preparation<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.399> we<00:01:25.880> did<00:01:26.030> that

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:26.209 
bit more preparation so we did that

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.779 
bit more preparation so we did that
along<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.780> way<00:01:26.899> I<00:01:27.140> think<00:01:27.319> what<00:01:27.860> we<00:01:28.069> did<00:01:28.670> this

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
along the way I think what we did this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.790 
along the way I think what we did this
year<00:01:28.850> would<00:01:29.179> probably<00:01:29.630> be<00:01:29.750> used<00:01:30.110> as<00:01:30.410> well<00:01:30.619> that

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
year would probably be used as well that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.370 
year would probably be used as well that
series<00:01:31.190> is<00:01:31.490> more<00:01:32.240> like<00:01:32.450> giving<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.170> girls

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
series is more like giving the girls

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.779 
series is more like giving the girls
positive<00:01:33.920> strokes<00:01:34.990> they<00:01:36.369> actually<00:01:37.369> train

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
positive strokes they actually train

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.169 
positive strokes they actually train
very<00:01:38.060> hard<00:01:38.179> and<00:01:38.630> at<00:01:39.590> times<00:01:39.860> they<00:01:40.190> probably<00:01:41.030> I

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
very hard and at times they probably I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.719 
very hard and at times they probably I
think<00:01:41.630> due<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.530> fatigue<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.979> exhaustion<00:01:43.399> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
think due to fatigue and exhaustion and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.180 
think due to fatigue and exhaustion and
school<00:01:44.179> schedules<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:44.929> on<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.649> I<00:01:45.679> think<00:01:45.950> we

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
school schedules and so on so I think we

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.889 
school schedules and so on so I think we
try<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.429> make<00:01:46.729> sure<00:01:46.910> that<00:01:47.060> they<00:01:47.270> have<00:01:47.420> an

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
try to make sure that they have an

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.410 
try to make sure that they have an
opportunity<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.920> be<00:01:49.670> able<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.940> be<00:01:50.030> able<00:01:50.119> a

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
opportunity to be able to be able a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.990 
opportunity to be able to be able a
strong<00:01:50.929> team<00:01:51.140> ever<00:01:52.069> since<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.550> joined<00:01:52.610> a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
strong team ever since I joined a

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.770 
strong team ever since I joined a
woollen<00:01:53.330> sect<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:54.099> 2001<00:01:55.099> so<00:01:55.340> he<00:01:56.119> says<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.630> has

qualities<00:03:42.660> such<00:03:43.350> as<00:03:43.380> perseverance<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.640> also

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
qualities such as perseverance and also

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.480 
qualities such as perseverance and also
mindset<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.080> excellence<00:03:46.590> er<00:03:46.770> which<00:03:47.280> are

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
mindset of excellence er which are

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.940 
mindset of excellence er which are
actually<00:03:48.090> part<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.480> our<00:03:48.660> school<00:03:49.020> values<00:03:49.380> so

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
actually part of our school values so

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.070 
actually part of our school values so
during<00:03:50.250> training<00:03:50.640> we<00:03:50.670> emphasize<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.660> lot<00:03:51.930> on

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
during training we emphasize a lot on

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.160 
during training we emphasize a lot on
our<00:03:52.110> school<00:03:52.620> values<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:53.100> want<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.370> instill

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
our school values you want to instill

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.050 
our school values you want to instill
school<00:03:55.170> values<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.740> develop<00:03:56.190> their<00:03:56.459> character

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
school values to develop their character

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.910 
school values to develop their character
so<00:03:57.630> basically<00:03:57.990> there<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.290> main<00:03:58.800> objective

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
so basically there is a main objective

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.150 
so basically there is a main objective
of<00:03:59.490> CCA<00:04:00.090> actually<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.350> believe<00:04:01.740> it's<00:04:01.950> going

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
of CCA actually so I believe it's going

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.640 
of CCA actually so I believe it's going
to<00:04:02.400> be<00:04:02.700> more<00:04:02.940> challenging<00:04:03.000> next<00:04:03.870> year<00:04:04.050> so<00:04:04.620> I

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
to be more challenging next year so I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.140 
to be more challenging next year so I
think<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.280> work<00:04:05.459> very<00:04:05.490> hard<00:04:05.760> and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
think you have to work very hard and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.540 
think you have to work very hard and
start<00:04:06.510> early<00:04:06.660> probably<00:04:07.380> after<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.950> media

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
start early probably after this media

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.180 
start early probably after this media
exam<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.450> movies<00:04:09.959> start<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.950> ball<00:04:11.160> rolling
