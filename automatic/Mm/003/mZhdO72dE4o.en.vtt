00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
these are really really pigmented and

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.569 
these are really really pigmented and
they've<00:03:41.180> last<00:03:41.480> forever<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.950> metallic<00:03:43.400> one

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
they've last forever the metallic one

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.910 
they've last forever the metallic one
you<00:03:43.820> would<00:03:43.940> think<00:03:44.410> wouldn't<00:03:45.410> really<00:03:45.769> be

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
you would think wouldn't really be

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.039 
you would think wouldn't really be
wearable<00:03:46.459> because<00:03:46.820> it's<00:03:46.940> metallic<00:03:47.269> but<00:03:47.750> it's

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
wearable because it's metallic but it's

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.140 
wearable because it's metallic but it's
really<00:03:48.410> really<00:03:48.769> subtle<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.880> kind<00:03:50.090> of

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
really really subtle and it just kind of

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.180 
really really subtle and it just kind of
adds<00:03:50.299> a<00:03:50.930> sheen<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.290> your<00:03:51.620> lips<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:52.010> kind<00:03:52.160> of

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
adds a sheen to your lips and it kind of

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.220 
adds a sheen to your lips and it kind of
mutes<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.549> color<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.480> color<00:03:53.989> would

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
mutes the color like this color would

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.370 
mutes the color like this color would
probably<00:03:54.829> be<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.480> like<00:03:56.480> BAM<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:57.019> your<00:03:57.140> face

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380

if<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:58.340> was<00:03:58.579> Matt<00:03:59.120> but<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.540> mutes<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.110> color

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
if it was Matt but it mutes the color

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.340 
if it was Matt but it mutes the color
just<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.769> little<00:04:01.040> bit<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:02.540> just<00:04:02.840> looks<00:04:03.230> like

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
just a little bit and it just looks like

just a little bit and it just looks like
natural<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.370> wouldn't<00:04:04.670> think<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.180> metallic

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
natural I wouldn't think that metallic

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.080 
natural I wouldn't think that metallic
lipstick<00:04:06.440> would<00:04:06.620> look<00:04:06.769> natural<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.060> I
