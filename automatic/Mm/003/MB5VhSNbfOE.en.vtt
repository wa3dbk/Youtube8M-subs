00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.920 
don't know why it's a Baltimore thing it
makes<00:01:28.710> no<00:01:28.829> sense<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:30.119> doing<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
makes no sense so I'm doing a like a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
makes no sense so I'm doing a like a
ball<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> big<00:01:31.890> sort<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.220> meringue<00:01:32.939> sort<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
ball like a big sort of meringue sort of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
ball like a big sort of meringue sort of
fall<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.130> gonna<00:01:35.250> carve<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
fall and then I'm gonna carve out the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
fall and then I'm gonna carve out the
middle<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> user<00:01:37.079> granite<00:01:37.530> say<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
middle do the user granite say on the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
middle do the user granite say on the
inside<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.880> made<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:39.150> little

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
inside and then we made these little

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.780 
inside and then we made these little
time<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.770> Saab<00:01:41.040> lays<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.430> snickerdoodles

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
time like Saab lays like snickerdoodles

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.700 
time like Saab lays like snickerdoodles
so<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> time<00:01:43.020> cookie<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:43.619> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
so it's like a time cookie and then it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.230 
so it's like a time cookie and then it's
gonna<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> yuzu<00:01:45.000> and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
gonna go right on top of the yuzu and
that's<00:01:45.570> sort<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:45.930> our<00:01:46.200> Intermezzo<00:01:46.799> is
