00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.059
 not to miss the new fascinating 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.910
 video so hello again to you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.279
 Alexander chess player and today we 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.570
 let's talk about such a thing men did 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.289
 let's talk about such a thing as tactics 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.099
 vs 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:32.930
 442 schemes as you know the most popular 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:40.500
 the scheme here it is with which the players are playing 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:46.010
 how to beat her save go 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 The first tactic is 4312 I mean 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.600
 four defenders 3 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.390
 blur not like this 3 midfielder 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 staying so started scared noisy on 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.250
 its position on it is desirable that all 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.449
 the players stood their ground as 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.810
 i just do 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:14.430
 guide is not so important and most important 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.090
 what you need to do is put tee 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 gear in the center to put the patient 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.229
 why the matter is that we have the most 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.009
 saturated it turns out the center but if 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.710
 does the opponent play with good 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.010
 flank midfielders there 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.140
 then it is desirable on the left and right 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.440
 they must stand very nice people 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.660
 players with the biggest skill 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.870
 there is naturally a desirable 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.050
 on their positions another tactic 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.830
 called 433 that is it all starts 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.730
 like this 4 3 3 hitters four 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.480
 quarterback 3 midfielder and 3 strikers 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.590
 but as for me it is the worst 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.660
 tactic against 442 she is very strong 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.150
 breaks the fountain it doesn't even help 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.730
 defenders on the word of honor very much call 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.850
 mail from not win is very very difficult 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.630
 and 100 shiva attack for floor 3 people 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:30.330
 better to put someone here 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:35.530
 the next is 41 41 41 so 4 right now we will return 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.390
 into place again 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:43.709
 so avalanche 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.709
 this ms that's sad 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:53.840
 let's do this 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.840
 and further away he is such a scheme 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:06.340
 This is a very strong scheme, especially if 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.700
 play it against the player on 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.909
 order above yours that is which 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.409
 skill 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:22.519
 this one here is but a lot of your bodies exceeded 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:25.219
 there u not laziness is the mistake that we all 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.150
 everything is fine which exceeds from this 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.150
 here is the skill 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.810
 big it is very very well and we even 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.490
 say i recommended you this scheme 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.040
 next is 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:49.970
 play three defenders one 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:54.280
 centurion then 4 midfielders and with one 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.080
 zapnik a and with one striker 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.710
 the most important thing in this silhouette pattern 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.380
 play but where to put the TV 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.380
 short pass and so there are no seats 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.409
 here is the gear style you need to put short 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.870
 not so easy 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:17.250
 in short you will be very fast 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.810
 lead the attacker to his position for 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.350
 the very blow 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.720
 very very good scheme can be 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.370
 also set if it's worth 4 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.010
 midfielder can be anyway 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.010
 set or if the next average 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.330
 such a weak player puts them in 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:45.150
 attack or put defense to 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.580
 they came back helped by a defender so 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.440
 one more circuit is very strong for 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.440
 hold it 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.430
 352 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.530
 This is a very strong communication scheme with 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:08.050
 midfielder they stand in principle 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:11.340
 principle walled and the whole attack of the enemy 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.580
 near will break about this our 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.710
 the chinese wall next they will 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.660
 very, very rarely take place but just in 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.440
 case you need to put extreme 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.509
 midfielders to return 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.389
 practiced 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:31.330
 so here are these pies guys 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.509
 subscribe to channel like 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.419

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:41.259
 can you suggest new tactics by 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.099
 comparing 42 or else 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.729
