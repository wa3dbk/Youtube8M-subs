00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
picking up here you can reduce this the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.880 
picking up here you can reduce this the

your<00:02:35.019> green<00:02:35.349> within<00:02:35.709> about<00:02:35.890> halfway<00:02:36.629> once<00:02:37.629> you

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
your green within about halfway once you

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.300 
your green within about halfway once you
get<00:02:37.870> any<00:02:38.019> higher<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.560> have<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> possibility<00:02:39.069> of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
get any higher you have a possibility of

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.399 
get any higher you have a possibility of
clipping<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:40.480> good<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.689> always<00:02:40.780> test<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.290> out

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
clipping it's good to always test it out

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.490 
clipping it's good to always test it out
before<00:02:41.889> you<00:02:42.849> record<00:02:43.480> because<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.139> don't<00:02:44.319> want

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
before you record because you don't want

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.559 
before you record because you don't want
to<00:02:45.220> start<00:02:45.609> recording<00:02:45.879> that<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.239> realize<00:02:46.450> you

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
to start recording that and realize you

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.119 
to start recording that and realize you
say<00:02:46.720> something<00:02:47.019> louder<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.500> clip<00:02:47.799> so

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
say something louder and you clip so

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.770 
say something louder and you clip so
it's<00:02:48.639> good<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.790> do<00:02:48.939> a<00:02:48.970> little<00:02:49.120> test<00:02:49.419> kind<00:02:49.689> of

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
it's good to do a little test kind of

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.210 
it's good to do a little test kind of
range<00:02:50.109> your<00:02:50.349> voice<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.650> little<00:02:50.739> bit<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.189> how

here<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:30.370> that's<00:03:30.459> pretty<00:03:30.729> much<00:03:30.879> it<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.239> then

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
here but that's pretty much it and then

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.939 
here but that's pretty much it and then
you're<00:03:31.449> ready<00:03:31.569> to<00:03:31.720> record<00:03:31.840> I'm<00:03:32.409> gonna<00:03:32.829> make

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
sure whichever track you're going to

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.930 
sure whichever track you're going to
record<00:03:34.629> on<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.169> have<00:03:35.319> it<00:03:35.409> selected<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
record on and you have it selected and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.069 
record on and you have it selected and
then<00:03:37.150> over<00:03:37.329> here<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.569> have<00:03:37.599> some<00:03:37.780> different

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
then over here you have some different

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.390 
then over here you have some different
settings<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.680> can<00:03:38.739> kind<00:03:38.979> of<00:03:39.040> actually

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
settings that you can kind of actually

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.020 
settings that you can kind of actually
sort<00:03:39.639> through<00:03:39.849> after<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.690> record<00:03:41.849> for<00:03:42.849> voice

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
sort through after you record for voice

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.339 
sort through after you record for voice
you<00:03:43.269> have<00:03:43.359> kind<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.629> two<00:03:43.720> different<00:03:43.750> sections

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
you have kind of two different sections

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.460 
you have kind of two different sections
I<00:03:44.470> think<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:44.859> more<00:03:45.040> for<00:03:45.220> singing<00:03:46.470> you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
I think this is more for singing you

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.659 
I think this is more for singing you
know<00:03:47.530> if<00:03:47.709> you're<00:03:47.829> gonna<00:03:47.919> be<00:03:48.099> recording<00:03:48.579> a

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
know if you're gonna be recording a

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.479 
know if you're gonna be recording a
vocal<00:03:49.000> track<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.840> singing<00:03:50.620> then<00:03:51.220> use<00:03:51.459> that

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
vocal track and singing then use that

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.509 
vocal track and singing then use that
but<00:03:51.849> podcasting<00:03:52.780> or<00:03:52.989> just<00:03:53.829> basic<00:03:54.159> things<00:03:54.189> do

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
but podcasting or just basic things do

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.110 
but podcasting or just basic things do
surprised<00:03:54.849> about<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.239> pretty<00:03:55.359> good<00:03:55.479> effects

you<00:04:02.349> can<00:04:02.500> do<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.620> few<00:04:02.889> tests<00:04:03.280> make<00:04:03.459> sure<00:04:03.579> it's

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:03.729 
you can do a few tests make sure it's

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.219 
you can do a few tests make sure it's
good<00:04:03.879> but<00:04:04.090> once<00:04:04.569> you're<00:04:04.689> ready<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.900> record

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229

instead<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.739> just<00:04:05.829> hitting<00:04:05.919> play<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.790> I

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
instead of just hitting play like I

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.490 
instead of just hitting play like I
think<00:04:06.939> when<00:04:07.509> you<00:04:07.599> first<00:04:07.720> start<00:04:08.019> using<00:04:08.169> audio

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
think when you first start using audio

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.199 
think when you first start using audio
recordings<00:04:09.009> you<00:04:09.220> kind<00:04:09.549> of<00:04:09.579> think<00:04:09.759> do<00:04:09.849> you<00:04:10.060> want

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209
