00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
one of our videos we tested my air vent

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.270 
one of our videos we tested my air vent
system<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.660> crude<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:59.010> eat

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
system it's I know it's crude don't eat

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.779 
system it's I know it's crude don't eat
me<00:00:59.489> alive<00:00:59.520> over<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.559> hoping<00:01:02.190> Polaris

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
me alive over it but I'm hoping Polaris

manufacturer will come up with a real
vent<00:01:10.960> system<00:01:11.530> but<00:01:12.160> I<00:01:12.430> want<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.090> report<00:01:13.540> this

vent system but I want to report this
worked<00:01:14.890> we<00:01:15.790> get<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.030> nice<00:01:16.420> volume<00:01:16.870> of<00:01:17.440> air<00:01:18.510> out

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
worked we get a nice volume of air out

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.130 
worked we get a nice volume of air out
of<00:01:19.840> this<00:01:20.050> hose<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.640> comes<00:01:21.970> out<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.510> it<00:01:22.720> here<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
of this hose it comes out of it here and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.170 
of this hose it comes out of it here and
I<00:01:23.260> did<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.090> trip<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.540> found<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:27.400> I<00:01:27.730> got<00:01:27.970> a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
I did on the trip I found that I got a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.410 
I did on the trip I found that I got a
better<00:01:28.420> airflow<00:01:28.870> by<00:01:29.560> moving<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:31.650> vent<00:01:32.650> hose

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
better airflow by moving this vent hose

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.170 
better airflow by moving this vent hose
over<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.050> right-hand<00:01:35.380> side<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.730> extreme

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
over to the right-hand side the extreme

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.260 
over to the right-hand side the extreme
right-hand<00:01:37.810> side<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.560> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
right-hand side that the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.480 
right-hand side that the
inch-and-a-quarter<00:01:40.270> hose<00:01:40.630> will<00:01:40.930> fit<00:01:41.200> into

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
inch-and-a-quarter hose will fit into

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.060 
inch-and-a-quarter hose will fit into
and<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.660> little<00:01:43.900> cooler<00:01:44.350> it's<00:01:44.530> behind<00:01:44.830> the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
and it's a little cooler it's behind the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.730 
and it's a little cooler it's behind the
tire<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:46.090> it's<00:01:46.240> away<00:01:46.570> from<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.960> engine<00:01:47.590> a

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
tire so it's away from the engine a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.580 
tire so it's away from the engine a
little<00:01:48.010> bit<00:01:48.160> more<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:49.450> did<00:01:49.930> test<00:01:50.560> one<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.370> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
little bit more we did test one of the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.710 
little bit more we did test one of the
people<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.770> responded<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.640> my<00:01:54.790> video<00:01:55.180> said

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
people that responded to my video said

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.880 
people that responded to my video said
Sam<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.860> need<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.250> move<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.820> up<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.590> mirror

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
Sam you need to move it up to the mirror

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.010 
Sam you need to move it up to the mirror
area<00:02:00.930> folks<00:02:01.930> we<00:02:02.620> took<00:02:02.890> his<00:02:03.130> advice<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:04.090> try<00:02:04.840> and

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
area folks we took his advice to try and

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.630 
area folks we took his advice to try and
get<00:02:05.170> fresh<00:02:05.500> air

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
get fresh air

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.320 
get fresh air
I<00:02:06.700> took<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.870> hose<00:02:08.110> loose<00:02:08.619> from<00:02:08.980> here<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.610> I

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
I took the hose loose from here and I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.430 
I took the hose loose from here and I
attached<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.220> was<00:02:12.370> right

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
attached it so that it was right

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.100 
attached it so that it was right
and<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:15.300> did<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.840> work<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.530> well<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.720> air

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
and it did not work as well the air

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.670 
and it did not work as well the air
temperature<00:02:19.770> was<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.280> any<00:02:20.640> better<00:02:21.030> than<00:02:21.680> what

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
temperature was not any better than what

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.640 
temperature was not any better than what
I<00:02:22.740> was<00:02:23.010> getting<00:02:23.370> before<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:25.110> think<00:02:25.380> if<00:02:25.500> you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
I was getting before and I think if you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
I was getting before and I think if you
see<00:02:25.950> you're<00:02:26.370> getting<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.970> clean<00:02:27.440> air<00:02:28.440> flow<00:02:29.810> from

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
see you're getting a clean air flow from

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.680 
see you're getting a clean air flow from
experience<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.640> best<00:02:32.760> place<00:02:33.390> for

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
experience this is the best place for

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.320 
experience this is the best place for
that<00:02:33.980> air<00:02:34.980> vent<00:02:35.790> hose<00:02:36.440> now<00:02:38.180> another<00:02:39.180> thing

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
that air vent hose now another thing

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.040 
that air vent hose now another thing
that<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:40.320> encounter<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.850> our<00:02:42.330> test

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
that we encounter in our test

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.820 
that we encounter in our test
there's<00:02:43.470> also<00:02:44.390> another

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.830 

that<00:02:48.130> there<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:49.180> hole<00:02:50.790> where<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.420> tube

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
that there is a hole where this tube

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.350 
that there is a hole where this tube
goes<00:02:53.200> into<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.070> through<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.970> engine

drastically cut down the heat so we

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.830 
drastically cut down the heat so we
