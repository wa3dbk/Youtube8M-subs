00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.660
 * play song 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.470
 This is what you get when you rent a rogue 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.980
 I can convince anyone of anything 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.200
 You see, there's a scientific method to get people to trust you. 

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:36.955
 I'm in. 

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:38.735
 Definitely not with your current experience. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.760
 Maybe ... you can teach me ... 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.640
 in your room ... 

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:45.118
 It's so naughty 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.980
 is it? 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.260
 Does it feel sexy on your face? 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.180
 so pretty 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.300
 Do this? Well, let's go. 

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:51.557
 We are about 30 strong 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.940
 Everyone gets a percentage. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.400
 Make it fast and get out. 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.220
 Who is the girl? 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.980
 She's our apprentice. 

00:00:58.556 --> 00:00:59.756
 Are you going to strike there? 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.900
 I'm with you. 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.020
 No Farhad, I'm not going to strike there, 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.900
 You have to hit it. 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.000
 We always stay in character 

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:09.407
 never break. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.520
 Where are the black people? 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.680
 I got it. 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.180
 What? 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.660
 Oh! Oh, sorry. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.880
 Congratulations. You're a rogue. 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.513
 You're probably the best I've ever seen. 

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:27.076
 So what about the great fraud 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.700
 I thought you were just playing big 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.894
 You mean the one where we make so much money that we all retire? 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.260
 It must happen quietly. No problems. 

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.134
 You look trustworthy, but you don't know me. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 Is he your target? 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.980
 It's great. 

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.466
 He's not a guy you want to cross swords. 

00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:56.118
 everything 

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:56.618
 1.1 million. 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.589
 Nicky, that's my money too. 

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:01.536
 For now, you're making things interesting 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 There is no room for caring in the game. 

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.196
 It will cause you death. 

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:06.968
 How does it feel? 

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:07.468
 Woow 

00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:15.193
 There are two kinds of people in this world. 

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:18.135
 There are hammers .... and nails. 

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:21.935
 You decide which one you want to be.
