00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.450
 good morning, diverse people, we are here 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:09.389
 on YouTube you will grant the micro and today you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.389
 I bring the presentation of the new system 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.089
 start of the season ruiz as already 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 you know they are not going to make the system 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.470
 start that we already had in season 2 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 but they are going to impose one that is new 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 for the season fruit in which it goes to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.060
 be everything better balanced this new 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.240
 system is going to be divided into six levels 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.600
 or 6 pierce that are the 5 that we know 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.100
 already of all the life that is to say bronze silver 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.900
 platinum gold and diamond plus one that's going to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.060
 be the aspirant who then you 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.530
 I will explain well and to detail what 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.840
 serves that level 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.539
 these three that you have seen here are going to 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.620
 be formed by leagues and each league 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:58.750
 will have a capacity of 250 players or 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.030
 of 250 teams these 250 players will be 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.629
 of a similar level since being in the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.089
 same league 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.610
 you will all have a level more or less 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.100
 similar to each of the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.830
 members 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.200
 while the feet are divided into 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.990
 leagues the leagues are divided into 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.590
 divisions each division will have a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.960
 capacity of 50 people or 50 teams 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.659
 as we see here every division has a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.690
 logo or badge where you can 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 observe that if the division is of minor 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.170
 degree then the badge is also more 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.369
 small while if we go up to the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 fifth division which is the largest 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.100
 It is the best and that is why we will have a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.170
 much bigger badge and much more 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 achieved with a larger diamond the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.190
 location where they are going to place us is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.830
 say in time they will place in the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.080
 league will have to do with the games that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.840
 you played during the preseason is 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.940
 say during this period and they will make a 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.200
 mean with the current elo you have and the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.869
 maximum of what you have got 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.630
 whereas if you have not played any 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.909
 start during the preseason 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.509
 you will have to play 10 rne that if 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.670
 you play in only yuc or five starts if 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.739
 you play for teams so they give you a 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.440
 esteemed and they can place you in a 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.040
 close once you are located in a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.890
 tier iv in one 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.319
 begins the progression stage for 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.150
 be able to progress to next levels what 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.760
 what you will have to do is play games 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.489
 run that in the case of losing a game 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.290
 start that will subtract points but for the 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.230
 otherwise in the case of winning the game 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.390
 I will add points and in the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.730
 when you reach 100 points 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.950
 will develop the promotion phase of your 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.549
 current division to ascend to division 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.389
 what we will have to do is win this 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.730
 promotion phase to the best of 3 while 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:51.250
 that to ascend to a new land is 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.799
 say to ascend for example from the tier 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.629
 from silver to gold tier what we have 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.629
 what to do is play the promotion phase 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.310
 to the best of five if by some chance not 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.159
 you win this promotion phase 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.650
 that is to say if to ascend from division 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.530
 you only earn one of three or to ascend 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.650
 of 100 you only win 2 out of 5 what they are going to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.389
 to do is to take away a series of points 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.400
 the current division and the current one in 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.139
 the one that you were for example if 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.760
 we had 100 points they are going to leave us with 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.909
 60 points 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.650
 when we have the 100 points again 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.470
 we can choose again to fight for 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.970
 move up from division or land if 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.790
 we get promoted from division or from 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.000
 tier on the next level we will have 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.610
 again 0 points but do not worry 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.440
 because despite having zero points 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.180
 we will enter a period of grace in the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.150
 which we can lose a series of 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.329
 games without descending of division but 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.920
 if once past this grace period 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.409
 we keep losing what will happen to us is 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.299
 that we will defend division but if 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.120
 we ascend from earth for example they 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.250
 they have money and making gold already 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.980
 As much as I lose, I will not be able to go down 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.470
 lose money there is only one rule 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.389
 that if you are 28 days inactive if that 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.239
 you can go down to the silver tier but if 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.400
 you lose games and have just accessed 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.700
 tier de oro you will never be able to download 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.530
 Silver rent let 's talk about the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.359
 abandonment just when we are in the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.239
 election of champions 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.039
 if we are playing only the first 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.500
 abandonment will take away a point of 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.080
 division and will leave us a minute without 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.789
 to play the next game is 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.250
 say without being able to enter the next 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.620
 election of champions while by 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.439
 consequently knowing we will be taken away 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.930
 many more points not only one and in addition 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:40.719
 they will lower us to be able to play starts 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.500
 for 30 minutes if we're playing in 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:44.439
 team 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.030
 the thing changes since if we abandon one 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.129
 tail and we're playing as a team 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.129
 will remove the team 10 points 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:54.610
 penalty but there will be no time 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.379
 to be able to join again is to say only 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.719
 they took 10 points and you can join 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.939
 again to the minute and if we take for 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.710
 leave the queue in the system 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.270
 competition is to say when we are 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.969
 competing for promotion of division or 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.580
 of the level the competition system is 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.259
 cancel and you are eliminated from power 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.110
 aspire to a new level or a new 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.180
 earth and good rock up here the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.560
 first part of the new start system 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.650
 that they will put on the season switch 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.710
 and tomorrow I'll hang the second part and I'll 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.690
 I will talk about the new one who is called aspiring 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.520
 and many more things so I do not 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.360
 lose and see you in the next rock 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.360
 see you later
