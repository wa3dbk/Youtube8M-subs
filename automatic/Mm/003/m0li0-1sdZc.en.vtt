00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
going to cover them in detail or

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.060 
going to cover them in detail or
actually<00:01:49.979> no<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.399> sorry<00:01:50.579> two<00:01:51.030> new<00:01:51.299> races<00:01:51.780> and

one new deathmatch one new parachute and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.160 
one new deathmatch one new parachute and
one<00:01:54.960> new<00:01:55.110> survival<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.689> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
one new survival so really it's not that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.899 
one new survival so really it's not that
much<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.740> mean<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.159> already<00:01:59.280> tons<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
much I mean there are already tons of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
much I mean there are already tons of
races<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.630> they're<00:02:01.170> only<00:02:01.200> adding<00:02:01.649> two<00:02:01.829> more

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
races and they're only adding two more

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.499 
races and they're only adding two more
so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.369> mean<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.060> big<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
so I mean it's really not that big of a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.569 
so I mean it's really not that big of a
deal<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.049> nonetheless<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:05.040> suppose<00:02:05.399> that's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
deal but nonetheless I suppose that's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.609 
deal but nonetheless I suppose that's
cool<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.689> here's<00:02:06.899> where<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> gets<00:02:07.200> more

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
cool but here's where it gets more

described<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.310> as<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.460> quite<00:03:49.790> effective<00:03:50.240> way<00:03:50.420> of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
described it as a quite effective way of

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.020 
described it as a quite effective way of
delivering<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.320> appropriate<00:03:51.860> message<00:03:52.070> in<00:03:52.610> up

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
delivering the appropriate message in up

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.230

close<00:03:53.450> combat<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.950> sounds<00:03:55.220> cool<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.850> guess

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
close combat so that sounds cool I guess

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.580

it'll<00:03:56.420> probably<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.960> same<00:03:56.990> effect<00:03:57.290> it's

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
it'll probably have the same effect it's

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.990 
it'll probably have the same effect it's
kind<00:03:57.740> of<00:03:57.770> like<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:57.920> knife<00:03:58.160> maybe<00:03:58.580> with<00:03:58.820> a<00:03:58.850> bit

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
kind of like a knife maybe with a bit

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.760 
kind of like a knife maybe with a bit
more<00:03:59.060> blood<00:03:59.420> or<00:03:59.570> something<00:03:59.720> not<00:04:00.380> really<00:04:00.590> sure

more blood or something not really sure

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.370 
more blood or something not really sure
