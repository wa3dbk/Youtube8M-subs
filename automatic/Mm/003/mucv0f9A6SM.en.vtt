 Hi everyone Cezanne Airy touch shadow today 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.610
 I would like to make makeup easily using the new color cassis brown eye shadow 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.120
 I will 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:26.520
 I think that I want to use the color of the lower left corner of the eye shadow to the main 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:32.369
 In we will start 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:37.190
 Take the eye shadow on the lower left eyebrow of the can makeup IBS 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.190
 I will extend the entire eyelid 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.330
 me 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 uh 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.030
 I feel like this 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:59.510
 Next the plaza limited pinmel 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.170
 blur using the wide of the mat in the middle of the nude in the box 2 No. raised 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.170
 I will 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 Go back to the lower left eye shadow of the previous sedan 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.990
 It will also paint the entire lower eyelid 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.630
 Top right color 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.630
 From the eyes side 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.400
 Integrated Cat Look Liquid Rider 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.200
 With limited color plum rate 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.200
 I will draw the eye line 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.130
 I'm done from the end 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.580
 It is good even if it is this 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.670
 Because the color was a bit confusing in the video 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.090
 Add the color of the lower right a little 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.090
 It was 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.010
 I think a little clearer by imposing a little 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.440
 Look at the balance and put the lower left color on the lower eyelid 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:03.660
 I will continue 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.660
 With the eyebrow under the inner corner of the eye in the upper left corner of the highlight color 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:21.990
 The color is a bit faint in the video, but it is actually a bit darker 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.990
 Thank you for watching until the end
