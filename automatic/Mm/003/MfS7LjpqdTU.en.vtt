complete their journey and I was
watching<00:01:46.140> TV<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> show<00:01:47.070> about

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
watching TV and it was a show about

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.830 
watching TV and it was a show about
people<00:01:47.460> who<00:01:47.640> had<00:01:47.790> near-death<00:01:48.090> experiences

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
people who had near-death experiences

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.319 
people who had near-death experiences
and<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.890> had<00:01:50.340> gotten<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> idea<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.180> what

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and I had gotten the idea of what what

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
and I had gotten the idea of what what
happens<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.740> make<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
happens if you just don't make it to the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
happens if you just don't make it to the
light<00:01:53.640> where<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> end<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
light where do you end up and just that

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
light where do you end up and just that
whole<00:01:55.890> idea<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.460> world<00:01:56.700> between<00:01:56.939> life<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
whole idea of a world between life and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.499 
whole idea of a world between life and
death<00:01:57.979> really<00:01:58.979> caught<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.670> imagination<00:01:59.790> what

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
death really caught my imagination what

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.999 
death really caught my imagination what
particularly<00:02:01.049> made<00:02:01.320> me<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> write<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
particularly made me want to write it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
particularly made me want to write it
was<00:02:02.640> when<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> realized<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.299> would<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.630> in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
was when I realized what would be in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.610 
was when I realized what would be in
this<00:02:03.960> world<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.219> places<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.729> no<00:02:06.329> long

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
this world all the places that no long

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.200 
this world all the places that no long
exists<00:02:07.010> but<00:02:07.190> yet<00:02:07.370> hold<00:02:07.580> such<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:07.820> place<00:02:08.000> in<00:02:08.150> our

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
exists but yet hold such a place in our

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.210 
exists but yet hold such a place in our
hearts<00:02:08.510> and<00:02:08.630> our<00:02:08.780> memories<00:02:09.260> will<00:02:09.740> still<00:02:10.040> be

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
hearts and our memories will still be

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.340 
hearts and our memories will still be
there<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:11.540> realized<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.200> World

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
there and I realized that the World

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.560 
there and I realized that the World
Trade<00:02:12.560> Center<00:02:12.950> would<00:02:13.640> be<00:02:13.820> an<00:02:13.940> ever<00:02:14.120> loss<00:02:14.360> in

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
Trade Center would be an ever loss in

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.000 
Trade Center would be an ever loss in
there<00:02:14.780> those<00:02:15.080> towers<00:02:15.470> will<00:02:15.620> stand<00:02:15.860> forever

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
there those towers will stand forever

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.420 
there those towers will stand forever
and<00:02:16.400> nothing<00:02:16.850> will<00:02:16.970> ever<00:02:17.090> tear<00:02:17.360> them<00:02:17.510> down
