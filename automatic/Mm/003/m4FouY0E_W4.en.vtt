little edge right there where you can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.860 
little edge right there where you can
see<00:00:34.680> right<00:00:34.710> under<00:00:35.190> him<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:36.000> take<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> look

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
see right under him but take a look

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.680 
see right under him but take a look
under<00:00:37.739> his<00:00:37.860> wheels<00:00:38.090> there's<00:00:39.090> nothing<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.600> his

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
under his wheels there's nothing on his

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.869 
under his wheels there's nothing on his
wheels<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:41.180> nothing<00:00:42.800> nothing<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
wheels see nothing nothing at all so I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.209 
wheels see nothing nothing at all so I
so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> guess<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> could<00:00:46.289> say<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:47.039> under

so I guess you could say and look under

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.100 
so I guess you could say and look under
here<00:00:47.329> looks<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.510> different<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
here looks very different than the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.760 
here looks very different than the
original<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> guess<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.390> could<00:00:51.449> say<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
original so I guess you could say what I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.869 
original so I guess you could say what I
call<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> guess<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.460> could<00:00:53.579> say<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
call I guess you could say it's a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.750 
call I guess you could say it's a
prototype<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.629> something<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.190> I'd<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> was

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
prototype or something I I'd say it was

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
prototype or something I I'd say it was
because<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.239> has<00:00:57.329> no<00:00:57.360> name<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:58.050> has<00:00:58.379> no<00:00:58.590> number

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

don't<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.649> if<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> prototype

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
don't know if it's not a prototype

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
don't know if it's not a prototype
someone<00:01:54.000> telling<00:01:54.240> me<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.840> say<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
someone telling me but I I say it's a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.649 
someone telling me but I I say it's a
prototype<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.850> has<00:01:56.969> nothing<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
prototype because it has nothing on the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.170 
prototype because it has nothing on the
wheels<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.369> kind<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.670> reminds<00:01:59.969> me<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
wheels it's a it kind of reminds me of

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.929 
wheels it's a it kind of reminds me of
our<00:02:00.329> both<00:02:00.540> Hills<00:02:00.890> prototype<00:02:01.890> Thomas<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
our both Hills prototype Thomas so I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.910 
our both Hills prototype Thomas so I
guess<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.479> kind<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.259> his

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
guess it's kind of like that because his

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740 
guess it's kind of like that because his
prototype<00:02:05.369> Thomas<00:02:05.909> has<00:02:06.119> nothing<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
prototype Thomas has nothing on the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.139 
prototype Thomas has nothing on the
wheels<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.469> does<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.770> Henry<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.789> Henry

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
wheels and so does this Henry this Henry

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.570 
wheels and so does this Henry this Henry
has<00:02:09.300> absolutely<00:02:09.810> nothing<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> wheels<00:02:10.800> no

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
has absolutely nothing on the wheels no

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.120 
has absolutely nothing on the wheels no
name

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
name

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.730 
name
no<00:02:12.760> nothing<00:02:13.150> just<00:02:13.360> did<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> couple<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.620> little

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
no nothing just did a couple of little

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.500 
no nothing just did a couple of little
circles<00:02:15.250> there<00:02:15.460> but<00:02:15.670> that's<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:16.030> there's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
circles there but that's it there's

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.940 
circles there but that's it there's
nothing<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.200> wheel<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.420> yeah<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.830> think

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
nothing on the wheel so yeah so I think

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.220 
nothing on the wheel so yeah so I think
it's<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.310> prototype<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.330> now<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:23.080> a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
it's a prototype so now I have a

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.430 
it's a prototype so now I have a
prototype<00:02:23.590> Henry<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.030> that's<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.050> now<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.380> is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
prototype Henry so that's so now this is

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.070 
prototype Henry so that's so now this is
my<00:02:26.530> rarest<00:02:27.160> wooden<00:02:27.520> train<00:02:27.820> in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> world<00:02:28.330> the

my rarest wooden train in the world the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.160 
my rarest wooden train in the world the

little stuffy and yeah so I call it a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.680 
little stuffy and yeah so I call it a
prototype<00:02:58.540> Henry<00:02:59.340> here's<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:01.420> yeah

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
prototype Henry here's just so yeah

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.830 
prototype Henry here's just so yeah
crazy<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.970> coupling<00:03:03.970> together<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.540> why

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
crazy in the coupling together and why

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.270

they would the touch of a finger you can

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.170 
they would the touch of a finger you can
uncouple<00:03:06.580> them<00:03:06.820> so<00:03:07.780> yeah<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.760> thought<00:03:10.000> you'd

thin wooden wheels no stable bottoms but
nothing<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> wheel<00:03:23.520> it's<00:03:24.520> crazy<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.600> had

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
nothing on the wheel it's crazy you had

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.570 
nothing on the wheel it's crazy you had
nothing<00:03:25.960> on<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.350> wheels<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.070> call<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.490> a

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
nothing on the wheels so I call it a

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.570 
nothing on the wheels so I call it a
prototype<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:29.320> yeah<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.980> yeah<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.160> think<00:03:33.310> that's

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
prototype so yeah so yeah I think that's

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.730 
prototype so yeah so yeah I think that's
the<00:03:33.700> last<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.240> so<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:35.410> all<00:03:35.620> my

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
the last of it so that's all my
