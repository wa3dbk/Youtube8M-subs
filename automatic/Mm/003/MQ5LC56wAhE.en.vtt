00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
here is a real nice like visual of the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.550 
here is a real nice like visual of the
plane<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:21.720> club<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> travel

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
plane that the club is going to travel

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.240 
plane that the club is going to travel
on<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:23.520> maybe<00:01:24.450> you've<00:01:24.659> seen<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.560> Ben<00:01:25.770> Hogan

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
on now maybe you've seen the Ben Hogan

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
on now maybe you've seen the Ben Hogan
sheet<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.939> glass<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.540> visual<00:01:28.020> real<00:01:28.530> good

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
sheet of glass like visual real good

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.350 
sheet of glass like visual real good
visual<00:01:29.100> visualizing<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> swing<00:01:30.150> plane

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
visual visualizing what the swing plane

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
visual visualizing what the swing plane
is<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.060> whole<00:01:33.240> plane<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.960> comes<00:01:34.200> up

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
is is so this whole plane just comes up

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.370 
is is so this whole plane just comes up
like<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:36.150> comes<00:01:36.299> over<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
like so and it comes over like that it's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.280 
like so and it comes over like that it's
just<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.650> continuous<00:01:38.189> plane<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
just a continuous plane so now that the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.630 
just a continuous plane so now that the
planet<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.740> talking<00:01:41.009> about<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
planet I'm talking about here is the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.969 
planet I'm talking about here is the
plane<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.869> shaft<00:01:43.140> okay<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.909> right<00:01:45.060> there

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
plane of the shaft okay so right there

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.380 
plane of the shaft okay so right there
this<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> give<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.790> real<00:01:48.210> nice

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
this is going to give you a real nice

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.590 
this is going to give you a real nice
visual<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> plane<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
visual of that plane I'm just like so

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.959 
visual of that plane I'm just like so
okay<00:01:53.600> get<00:01:54.380> little<00:01:54.679> shots<00:01:54.890> like<00:01:55.069> that<00:01:57.939> now<00:01:58.939> I

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
okay get little shots like that now I

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.559 
okay get little shots like that now I
know<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.659> my<00:02:00.229> short<00:02:00.590> game<00:02:00.679> I<00:02:01.100> tend<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.000> get<00:02:02.240> a

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
know in in my short game I tend to get a

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.649 
know in in my short game I tend to get a
little<00:02:03.289> bit<00:02:03.759> like<00:02:04.759> jump<00:02:05.060> over<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.509> ball

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
little bit like jump over the ball

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.989 
little bit like jump over the ball
sometimes<00:02:06.020> which<00:02:06.709> is<00:02:06.859> going<00:02:07.039> to<00:02:07.159> cause<00:02:07.700> me<00:02:07.909> to

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
sometimes which is going to cause me to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.430 
sometimes which is going to cause me to
go<00:02:08.090> like<00:02:08.239> that<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.750> can<00:02:08.869> see<00:02:09.080> right<00:02:09.110> there

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
go like that now you can see right there

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.949 
go like that now you can see right there
i'm<00:02:09.709> outside<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.819> plane<00:02:11.090> i'm<00:02:11.330> off<00:02:11.599> playing

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
i'm outside the plane i'm off playing
