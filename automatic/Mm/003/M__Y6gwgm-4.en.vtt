motorola moto g and the sony xperia m2

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.109 
motorola moto g and the sony xperia m2
so<00:00:23.400> let's<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.330> started<00:00:25.760> starting<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
so let's get started starting with the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.439 
so let's get started starting with the
build<00:00:27.390> quality<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.199> motorola<00:00:28.619> moto<00:00:29.130> g<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.609> 199

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
build quality the motorola moto g is 199

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.470 
build quality the motorola moto g is 199
point<00:00:30.900> 9<00:00:31.109> mm<00:00:31.439> tall<00:00:31.679> while<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.279> Sony<00:00:32.550> Xperia<00:00:32.790> m2

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
point 9 mm tall while the Sony Xperia m2

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.100 
point 9 mm tall while the Sony Xperia m2
is<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.500> 39.6<00:00:35.460> mm<00:00:35.820> thought<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> its

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
is one 39.6 mm thought because of its

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.920 
is one 39.6 mm thought because of its
big<00:00:37.440> display<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.489> thickness<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.570> motorola

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
big display in thickness the motorola

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.670 
big display in thickness the motorola
moto<00:00:40.469> g<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:41.600> thicker<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> Sony<00:00:43.440> Xperia

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
moto g is thicker than the Sony Xperia

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
moto g is thicker than the Sony Xperia
m2<00:00:44.219> by<00:00:44.640> 3<00:00:44.969> mm<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.750> Sony<00:00:46.260> Xperia<00:00:46.590> m2<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.600> slimmer

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
m2 by 3 mm so Sony Xperia m2 is slimmer

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.500 
m2 by 3 mm so Sony Xperia m2 is slimmer
than<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.020> motorola<00:00:49.649> moto<00:00:49.950> g<00:00:50.129> also<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.329> weight

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
than the motorola moto g also the weight

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
than the motorola moto g also the weight
of<00:00:51.809> motorola<00:00:52.469> moto<00:00:52.680> g<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.629> 143<00:00:54.629> grams<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.620> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
of motorola moto g is 143 grams and that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.770 
of motorola moto g is 143 grams and that
of<00:00:56.219> sony<00:00:56.460> xperia<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:58.129> 148<00:00:59.129> grams<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
of sony xperia is 148 grams so the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.709 
of sony xperia is 148 grams so the
motorola<00:01:01.260> moto<00:01:01.469> g<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:02.219> thicker<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.480> as

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
motorola moto g just thicker but not as

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.620 
motorola moto g just thicker but not as
high<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.830> Sony<00:01:05.159> Xperia<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.970> coming

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
high as that of Sony Xperia and coming

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.570 
high as that of Sony Xperia and coming
to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> hardware<00:01:07.170> specifications<00:01:07.979> starting

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
to the hardware specifications starting

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.850 
to the hardware specifications starting
with<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> chipset<00:01:09.360> both<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.990> them<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.560> same

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with the chipset both of them have same

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.289 
with the chipset both of them have same
chipset<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.390> com<00:01:12.720> Snapdragon<00:01:13.530> 400

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
chipset that is all com Snapdragon 400

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
chipset that is all com Snapdragon 400
the<00:01:15.299> processor<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.259> both<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.890> cortex<00:01:17.610> a7

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the processor they both have cortex a7

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.870 
the processor they both have cortex a7
in<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.560> GPU<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.009> also<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> same

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
in them and the GPU is also the same

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
in them and the GPU is also the same
that<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.830> adreno<00:01:22.830> 305<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.890> hardware

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that is adreno 305 so in the hardware

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
that is adreno 305 so in the hardware
they<00:01:26.640> both<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:27.090> similar<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> each<00:01:27.960> other<00:01:28.259> now

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
they both are similar to each other now

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.090 
they both are similar to each other now

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the memory the motorola moto g comes in

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.600 
the memory the motorola moto g comes in
8gb<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.000> 16gb<00:01:33.240> variant<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.430> an

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
expandable slow while on the other hand

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.300 
expandable slow while on the other hand
the<00:01:38.460> sony<00:01:38.729> xperia<00:01:39.270> m2<00:01:39.619> comes<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:41.009> 8gb

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the sony xperia m2 comes with 8gb

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.719 
the sony xperia m2 comes with 8gb
internal<00:01:41.790> memory<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> has<00:01:43.530> an<00:01:43.799> XL<00:01:44.250> undable

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
internal memory but has an XL undable

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.190 
internal memory but has an XL undable
slot<00:01:45.240> 4<00:01:45.600> 32gb<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.189> sony<00:01:47.520> xperia<00:01:48.119> m2<00:01:48.329> has<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> plus

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
slot 4 32gb so sony xperia m2 has a plus

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.859 
slot 4 32gb so sony xperia m2 has a plus
point<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:50.130> Motorola<00:01:50.610> MOTO<00:01:50.939> G<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.420> also

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
point but Motorola MOTO G is also

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.520 
point but Motorola MOTO G is also
supported<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> OTG<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
supported with the OTG so there if you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.459 
supported with the OTG so there if you
want<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> expand<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.670> memory<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.630> OTG<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
want to expand your memory so OTG is a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.310 
want to expand your memory so OTG is a
nice<00:01:58.770> option<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.280> you

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
nice option for you

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.360 
nice option for you
now<00:02:00.470> they<00:02:01.130> both<00:02:01.400> have<00:02:01.760> 1gb<00:02:02.300> of<00:02:02.450> RAM<00:02:02.840> also<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:03.950> in

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
now they both have 1gb of RAM also so in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.580 
now they both have 1gb of RAM also so in
the<00:02:04.670> hardware<00:02:04.970> specifications<00:02:05.870> almost<00:02:06.380> all
