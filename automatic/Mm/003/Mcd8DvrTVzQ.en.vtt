00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.200
 very good all kids how are you 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.000
 I hope very well of course and if I already 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.160
 I'm back I once again 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.730
 madrid we return to normal with this 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.710
 super hyper triple low but good I'm 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.150
 here once again I am in the 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.279
 comments I am answering all 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.419
 the ones that I can to the messages I've also 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.640
 returned to play today after about 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.919
 how many days a week dow a bit bad 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.470
 because the command was super weird 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.079
 when I take it and today I bring you a super 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.999
 super map I know a little bit late but 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.720
 I bring you a super first because it is 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.460
 a death assault is a very fast 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.170
 be assault in little more than three 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.090
 minutes or three minutes and something I do not know 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.530
 because I just pulled it out right now 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.660
 and speaking is super fast because 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.670
 I want to upload this video as soon as possible 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.870
 which is very late especially for the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.790
 Spanish schedule not for 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.920
 South American but grant as it was 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.140
 saying this game like I do 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.090
 some that other times I'm going to 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.350
 leave the description because all 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.900
 those people who are always 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.100
 saying the same thing as if it were also 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.470
 I would like for me to touch on those 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.149
 banks that I do not know I do not know how many 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.800
 I will leave for you this 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.200
 heading in the description 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.390
 so you can see how bad the bad thing happened 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.550
 and how badly the whole team had it 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.100
 because as you see we are losing we are going to 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.720
 keep losing more and more and more and 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.930
 we get back we get 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.510
 go up the game and round kids 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.190
 the video is round but they forgive 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.900
 what do you kill that I'm just going to 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.120
 bring the most obvious to have the streak with 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.130
 wizards always and good 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.660
 Tell you when you are with subscribers 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.160
 with a lot of subscribers this afternoon and 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.010
 I want to clarify a little something that 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.880
 it worries me because the truth 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.710
 many of you find 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.350
 with me very much art and you want 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.720
 play with me in the play me the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.040
 saturnal to messages and it's something that 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.080
 made me rethink the first time 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.880
 close the privacy and so I did my 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.620
 main account but the account 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.320
 subscribers I do not want to do it but from 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.110
 true sometimes guys if you are 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.120
 with me tell me you tell me by the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.890
 micro frame I do not know what invite me and six 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.860
 spaces I truly invite you 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.440
 or you invite me once and I in case of 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.640
 that there is space as I say I invite you but 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.040
 what you can not do here this for 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.159
 he has that because he does not catch me 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.530
 a couple or three people after they join 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.420
 at the game not because obviously 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.340
 when you begin to divide the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.500
 good people are leaving and then other people are 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 connect that thank god was more bad 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 especially in sniper that you will see me 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.140
 gives the buap of how bad it is but good 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.819
 as I was saying please do not 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.480
 saturÃ© jsa messages that the play is me 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.519
 blocks then almost all the time not 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.340
 because you are constantly sending me 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.030
 messages play with me add me 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.680
 invitation invitation invitation 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.750
 invitation invitation invitation and is 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.459
 something is a little messy the truth so 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.590
 good thing is running out and I 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.480
 It seems that I only have one uncle left 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.370
 here I think this is what I do not see 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.200
 is this and another one to give me love 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.540
 and as I say I just got it 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.409
 right now I think it's my best death 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.689
 assault 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.060

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.980

 like button because this is my best 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.209
 this is my best assault mode of all 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.919
 what I carry very warfare players 3
