00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
message on one of my videos asking for

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.810 
message on one of my videos asking for
some<00:00:10.760> more<00:00:10.850> information<00:00:11.330> on<00:00:11.450> the<00:00:11.630> 400<00:00:12.820> regards

some more information on the 400 regards

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.200 
some more information on the 400 regards
to<00:00:14.060> the<00:00:14.350> acceleration<00:00:15.350> and<00:00:15.710> braking<00:00:16.129> so<00:00:17.060> that

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
to the acceleration and braking so that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.570 
to the acceleration and braking so that
might<00:00:17.359> be<00:00:17.539> a<00:00:17.570> good<00:00:18.010> you<00:00:19.010> know<00:00:19.100> kind<00:00:19.310> of<00:00:19.369> test

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
might be a good you know kind of test

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.169 
might be a good you know kind of test
anyway<00:00:19.990> so<00:00:20.990> I<00:00:21.410> got<00:00:22.339> the<00:00:22.429> steel<00:00:22.669> here<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:22.999> miles

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
anyway so I got the steel here in miles

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.300 
anyway so I got the steel here in miles
per<00:00:23.359> hour<00:00:23.509> so<00:00:24.079> people<00:00:24.890> will<00:00:25.009> be<00:00:25.130> able<00:00:25.160> to

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
per hour so people will be able to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.040 
per hour so people will be able to
understand<00:00:25.730> what<00:00:25.880> that<00:00:25.999> what<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:26.779> hell<00:00:26.929> the

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
understand what that what the hell the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.769 
understand what that what the hell the
numbers<00:00:27.349> mean<00:00:27.499> and<00:00:28.029> I<00:00:29.029> think<00:00:29.089> the<00:00:29.359> speedo<00:00:29.630> in

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
numbers mean and I think the speedo in

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.140 
numbers mean and I think the speedo in
this<00:00:29.900> thing<00:00:30.050> reads<00:00:30.289> a<00:00:30.380> little<00:00:30.619> low<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:31.159> don't

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
this thing reads a little low I don't

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.330 
this thing reads a little low I don't
know<00:00:32.210> if<00:00:32.270> that's<00:00:32.450> normal<00:00:33.140> or<00:00:33.470> not<00:00:33.620> it<00:00:33.950> seems

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
know if that's normal or not it seems

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.650 
know if that's normal or not it seems
whatever<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.730> go<00:00:34.880> through<00:00:35.090> like<00:00:35.239> when<00:00:35.570> those

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
whatever I go through like when those

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.520 
whatever I go through like when those
radar<00:00:36.399> thingies<00:00:37.399> it<00:00:37.640> always<00:00:38.260> shows<00:00:39.260> me<00:00:39.289> about

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
radar thingies it always shows me about

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.910 
radar thingies it always shows me about
five<00:00:39.739> kilometers<00:00:40.280> low<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:40.879> I<00:00:41.739> assume<00:00:42.739> that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
five kilometers low so I assume that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.729 
five kilometers low so I assume that
means<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.160> got<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.370> go<00:00:43.460> to<00:00:43.519> like<00:00:43.989> 63<00:00:44.989> miles<00:00:45.530> an

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
means I got to go to like 63 miles an

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.680 
means I got to go to like 63 miles an
hour<00:00:45.859> or<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.190> get<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.340> 60<00:00:46.910> miles<00:00:47.149> an<00:00:47.359> hour

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
hour or to get to 60 miles an hour

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.110 
hour or to get to 60 miles an hour
63<00:00:48.350> on<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.530> speedo<00:00:48.769> so<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.550> guess<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:49.789> guys<00:00:49.879> can

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
63 on the speedo so I guess you guys can

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.639 
63 on the speedo so I guess you guys can
watch<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.480> speedo<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:50.809> time<00:00:51.140> for<00:00:51.350> yourself

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
watch the speedo and time for yourself

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.049 
watch the speedo and time for yourself
and<00:00:52.719> keep<00:00:53.719> in<00:00:53.840> mind<00:00:54.019> that<00:00:54.170> I'm<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.670> I'm<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:55.730> novice

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
and keep in mind that I'm a I'm a novice

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.130 
and keep in mind that I'm a I'm a novice

rider and I'm out here on a very lonely
deserted<00:01:00.739> Road<00:01:00.949> here<00:01:01.160> for<00:01:01.879> obvious<00:01:02.210> reasons

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
deserted Road here for obvious reasons

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:15.500 
deserted Road here for obvious reasons
all<00:01:04.220> right<00:01:04.370> well<00:01:04.670> here<00:01:04.879> we<00:01:04.970> go

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.410 

but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.240 

and<00:01:18.570> blue<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:20.370> blue<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.760> shift<00:01:21.150> bad<00:01:21.510> oh

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
and blue that and blue that shift bad oh

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.140 
and blue that and blue that shift bad oh
yeah<00:01:23.250> try<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.760> again

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.240 

okay<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.420> go

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
okay here we go

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:39.149 
okay here we go
0-60

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.649 

the<00:01:39.460> lady<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.880> don't<00:01:40.000> know<00:01:40.180> what<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.420> works

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
the lady I don't know what that works

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.249 
the lady I don't know what that works
out<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:41.049> time<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:42.340> was<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:42.939> one<00:01:43.259> so

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
out to a time how was it to that one so

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:52.920 
out to a time how was it to that one so
now<00:01:44.409> check<00:01:44.710> for<00:01:45.219> Kravitz<00:01:45.869> drop<00:01:46.869> down<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:48.689> zero

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:07.219 

oh<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.890> totally<00:01:56.890> locked<00:01:57.070> up<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.370> back<00:01:57.550> there

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:30.680 

not<00:02:08.229> all<00:02:08.349> squidy<00:02:09.300> try<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.479> again

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.440 

so<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.720> guess<00:02:31.960> that's<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.000> zero

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
so I guess that's that that's the zero

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.570 
so I guess that's that that's the zero
60<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.050> 62<00:02:35.440> zero<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:38.220> want<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> little<00:02:39.400> high

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
60 and 62 zero and I want a little high

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.880 
60 and 62 zero and I want a little high
on<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:40.120> speedo<00:02:40.540> because<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:43.270> doesn't<00:02:43.830> nothing<00:02:44.830> a

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
on a speedo because it doesn't nothing a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.730 
on a speedo because it doesn't nothing a
reads<00:02:45.130> correctly<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.900> don't<00:02:47.440> know<00:02:47.620> this

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
reads correctly like I don't know this

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.830 
reads correctly like I don't know this
is<00:02:47.860> all<00:02:48.040> motorcycles<00:02:48.760> where<00:02:48.880> they<00:02:49.000> they

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
is all motorcycles where they they

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.460 
is all motorcycles where they they
rigged<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> speedo<00:02:51.690> reads<00:02:52.690> uh<00:02:52.960> a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
rigged it so that the speedo reads uh a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.400 
rigged it so that the speedo reads uh a
little<00:02:54.160> bit<00:02:54.280> high<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.820> on<00:02:55.480> line<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.930> noticed

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
little bit high but on line I noticed

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.660 
little bit high but on line I noticed
that<00:02:56.620> when<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.980> go<00:02:57.130> through<00:02:57.160> those<00:02:57.430> radar

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
that when I go through those radar

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.230 
that when I go through those radar
things<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:59.830> always<00:03:00.070> like<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.880> know<00:03:00.970> five

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
things I'm always like you know five

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.050 
things I'm always like you know five
kilometers<00:03:01.950> slower<00:03:02.950> than<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.280> think<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.700> am<00:03:03.820> like

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
kilometers slower than I think I am like

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.530 
kilometers slower than I think I am like
this<00:03:04.180> feel<00:03:04.480> receives<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.960> read<00:03:05.110> five<00:03:05.320> fly<00:03:05.890> fast

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this feel receives to read five fly fast

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.250 
this feel receives to read five fly fast
so<00:03:07.540> that's<00:03:07.720> that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
so that's that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.100 
so that's that
the<00:03:08.470> other<00:03:08.590> question<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.810> reason<00:03:11.050> I'm

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
the other question on the reason I'm

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.420 
the other question on the reason I'm
doing<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.590> guess<00:03:11.740> is<00:03:11.890> because<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
doing this I guess is because of the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.860 
doing this I guess is because of the
somebody<00:03:13.030> asking<00:03:13.240> a<00:03:13.300> question<00:03:13.600> about<00:03:13.630> all

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
somebody asking a question about all

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.370 
somebody asking a question about all
this<00:03:13.959> stuff<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:17.020> other<00:03:17.140> question<00:03:18.070> was

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
this stuff but the other question was

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.290 
this stuff but the other question was
about<00:03:20.380> shifting<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:23.610> would<00:03:24.610> have<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> say

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
about shifting and I would have to say

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.010 
about shifting and I would have to say
that's<00:03:25.810> difficult<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.920> answer<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.720> mean<00:03:28.720> in

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
that's difficult to answer I mean in

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.509 
that's difficult to answer I mean in
some<00:03:29.530> respects<00:03:30.570> yes<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:32.290> had<00:03:32.530> issues<00:03:33.370> with

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
some respects yes I have had issues with

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.900 
some respects yes I have had issues with
shifting<00:03:34.380> but<00:03:35.380> those<00:03:35.620> issues<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.670> think<00:03:36.700> are

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
shifting but those issues I think are

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.509 
shifting but those issues I think are
largely<00:03:37.300> because<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:37.780> my<00:03:38.050> inability<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.160> shift

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
largely because of my inability to shift

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.979 
largely because of my inability to shift
because<00:03:40.150> I'm<00:03:40.239> like<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> new<00:03:40.690> new<00:03:41.050> rider<00:03:41.350> but<00:03:41.850> I

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
because I'm like a new new rider but I

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.320 
because I'm like a new new rider but I
find<00:03:43.989> if<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:45.010> come<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.700> stoplight<00:03:46.030> or

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
find if I I come to a stoplight or

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.420 
find if I I come to a stoplight or
something<00:03:46.750> I'm<00:03:46.840> stolen<00:03:47.170> third<00:03:47.410> shifting<00:03:48.280> from

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
something I'm stolen third shifting from

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.280 
something I'm stolen third shifting from
you<00:03:48.640> know<00:03:48.760> when<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> bike<00:03:49.360> is<00:03:49.510> stock<00:03:49.780> shifting

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
you know when a bike is stock shifting

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.979 
you know when a bike is stock shifting
down<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:51.150> difficult<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.390> don't<00:03:52.690> know<00:03:52.870> whether

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
down is difficult I don't know whether

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.470 
down is difficult I don't know whether
that's<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.440> this<00:03:53.590> biker<00:03:53.860> or<00:03:54.790> bikes<00:03:55.269> in

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
that's just this biker or bikes in

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.040 
that's just this biker or bikes in
general<00:03:56.100> but<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:58.120> that's<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.510> problem<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:58.900> if<00:03:58.989> I

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
general but so that's a problem but if I

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.540 
general but so that's a problem but if I
the<00:03:59.110> bike<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.650> motion<00:03:59.800> I<00:04:00.070> don't<00:04:00.250> seem<00:04:00.519> to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
the bike is in motion I don't seem to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
the bike is in motion I don't seem to
have<00:04:00.730> any<00:04:00.910> problem<00:04:01.420> especially<00:04:02.140> now<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:03.540> yeah<00:04:04.540> I

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
have any problem especially now I yeah I

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.000 
have any problem especially now I yeah I
guess<00:04:04.780> as<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.019> said<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.260> used<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.620> have<00:04:05.769> more

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
guess as I said I used to have more

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.330 
guess as I said I used to have more
problems<00:04:06.160> than<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.459> have<00:04:06.640> now<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.650> don't<00:04:09.280> know

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
problems than I have now so I don't know

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.220 
problems than I have now so I don't know
whether<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.550> was<00:04:09.730> just<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.540> bike<00:04:10.750> breaking

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
whether that was just the bike breaking

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.400 
whether that was just the bike breaking
in<00:04:11.440> or<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:13.060> inability<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.720> know<00:04:13.959> how<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.140> chef

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
in or my inability to know how to chef

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.759 
in or my inability to know how to chef
and<00:04:14.620> that's<00:04:14.790> that's<00:04:15.790> pretty<00:04:16.060> much<00:04:16.150> it

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
and that's that's pretty much it

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.129 
and that's that's pretty much it
anyway<00:04:17.489> hope<00:04:17.699> this<00:04:17.910> was<00:04:18.389> instructable<00:04:18.959> for

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
anyway hope this was instructable for

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.139 
anyway hope this was instructable for
you<00:04:19.199> guys<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.819> I'll<00:04:20.819> see<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.720> next<00:04:21.780> time
