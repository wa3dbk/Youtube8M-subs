00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.340 
able to when you're playing the game if
someone<00:04:24.360> speaks<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.660> different<00:04:24.750> language<00:04:24.930> and

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
someone speaks a different language and

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.260 
someone speaks a different language and
will<00:04:25.500> translate<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.250> into<00:04:26.400> your<00:04:26.730> language<00:04:26.970> and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
will translate it into your language and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.370 
will translate it into your language and
you'll<00:04:27.360> be<00:04:27.450> able<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.630> understand<00:04:28.020> them<00:04:28.230> I

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
you'll be able to understand them I

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
you'll be able to understand them I
think<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:28.740> really<00:04:28.860> great<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.220> be<00:04:29.340> able

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
think this is really great to be able

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.470 
think this is really great to be able
understand<00:04:29.820> like<00:04:29.970> maybe<00:04:30.150> some<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.419> the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
understand like maybe some of the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.180 
understand like maybe some of the
Russians<00:04:30.780> or<00:04:30.900> Brazilians<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.620> we<00:04:31.950> sort<00:04:32.130> of

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
Russians or Brazilians that we sort of

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.700 
Russians or Brazilians that we sort of
isolate<00:04:32.580> ourselves<00:04:32.700> from<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:34.020> vice<00:04:34.200> versa

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
isolate ourselves from and vice versa

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.260 
isolate ourselves from and vice versa
the<00:04:35.160> only<00:04:35.400> issue<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.640> could<00:04:35.820> see<00:04:35.970> with<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.240> is

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
the only issue I could see with it is

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.940 
the only issue I could see with it is
that<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.510> doesn't<00:04:37.050> translate<00:04:37.290> slang<00:04:37.710> or

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
that it doesn't translate slang or

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.010 
that it doesn't translate slang or
misspelled<00:04:38.340> words<00:04:38.640> so<00:04:39.150> other<00:04:39.510> than<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.840> I

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
misspelled words so other than that I

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.840 
misspelled words so other than that I
think<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.620> would<00:04:40.890> really<00:04:41.100> help<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:41.700> that

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
think that it would really help but that

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.940 
think that it would really help but that
might<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.060> know<00:04:42.240> clog<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.020> up<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.169> bit<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.530> think

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
might you know clog it up a bit I think

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.110 
might you know clog it up a bit I think
it<00:04:44.040> might<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.280> great<00:04:44.520> addition<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.060> it

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
it might be a great addition and it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.450 
it might be a great addition and it
might<00:04:45.240> help<00:04:45.630> tone<00:04:46.320> down<00:04:46.530> some<00:04:46.590> hostility<00:04:47.160> that

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
might help tone down some hostility that

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.370 
might help tone down some hostility that
we<00:04:47.790> seem<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.270> get<00:04:48.480> towards<00:04:48.930> people<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.320> we

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
we seem to get towards people that we

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.130 
we seem to get towards people that we
can't<00:04:49.620> understand<00:04:50.040> if<00:04:50.220> we're<00:04:50.370> not<00:04:50.550> like<00:04:50.730> us

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
can't understand if we're not like us

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.330 
can't understand if we're not like us
the<00:04:52.140> application<00:04:52.590> also<00:04:52.710> doesn't<00:04:53.040> trigger<00:04:53.160> the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
the application also doesn't trigger the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.070 
the application also doesn't trigger the
anti<00:04:53.640> cheat<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.660> actually<00:04:54.780> like

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
anti cheat so it's actually like

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.800
