00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.090
 your opi today 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.460
 but in general on my channel will be 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.679
 there is such a heading 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.199
 of course you support her that is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.480
 Like the general heading 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.949
 opencs is called frankly is opening 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.199
 case of arbitrariness 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.490
 I think in principle it is cool but also 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.609
 principle so not cheap entertainment 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.270
 but she principle today will open 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.270
 one key and since this is the first video and in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.040
 In principle, I think something will fall into 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.550
 general key I have a far departure 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.850
 general drank so even sincere in incentive 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 but generally back than baksan if anyone can 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.289

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.040
 the opening in this game is okay in general 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.100

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.110
