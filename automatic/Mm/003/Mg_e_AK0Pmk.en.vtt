tomorrow<00:01:20.160> because<00:01:21.160> she's<00:01:21.370> already<00:01:21.610> doing

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
tomorrow because she's already doing

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670 
tomorrow because she's already doing
pretty<00:01:23.530> poorly<00:01:23.950> with<00:01:24.790> her<00:01:24.940> breathing<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
pretty poorly with her breathing and I

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.070 
pretty poorly with her breathing and I
don't<00:01:26.740> want<00:01:27.040> her<00:01:27.160> to<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.400> in<00:01:27.520> pain<00:01:28.080> she's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
don't want her to be in pain she's

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.520 
don't want her to be in pain she's
losing<00:01:29.830> coordination<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.080> can<00:01:32.380> only

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
losing coordination and so I can only

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.620 
losing coordination and so I can only
guess<00:01:32.800> that<00:01:33.040> that<00:01:33.190> is<00:01:33.400> from<00:01:34.140> prolonged<00:01:36.630> oxygen

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
guess that that is from prolonged oxygen

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.370 
guess that that is from prolonged oxygen
deprivation

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
deprivation

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:48.370 
deprivation
I<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:40.240> booth<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.360> she's<00:01:43.570> been<00:01:43.720> real<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:44.140> list

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.640 

she's<00:01:49.380> having<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.890> much<00:01:50.009> trouble<00:01:50.220> breathing
