00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.160
 welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.300
 play saving I know you are there 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.189
 unfortunately you were waiting for a retro topic 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.680
 but we didn't have a material with which 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.109
 fill it because simply a few of 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.689
 you wanted to participate in that 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 project and for this we will wait for 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.030
 have other videos for those who didn't 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.620
 following the episode did not know what is the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.050
 asks how we look at the end 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.239
 of this video where you will find all the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.800
 case information 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.690
 But always remember to three minutes 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.789
 maximum of videos so we will wait for 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.890
 receive more videos and then we will publish 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.449
 the episode is sorry because in the end 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.010
 to a column we did for you 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.809
 to give you a voice to give you the chance 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.460
 to appear one of our videos and then 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.440
 let us see your indie channel we are 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.879
 remained somewhat disappointed a moment has 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.379
 did not like this 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.239
 idea you don't have to be afraid ie to 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.340
 end is simply a video there 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.590
 you really scared to crash 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.950
 vatel a video as we return to ours 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.870
 heading to the theme of this episode that knows 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.100
 play saving third bet 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.980
 in this episode we will talk about 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.300
 gay cd resellers do not steam like 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.800
 we did in the last episode but 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.720
 simply the cd sellers that that 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 then they allow you to activate them on the various 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.530
 platforms 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.740
 there are so many but so many 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.440
 so many that it would be impossible to review you 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.940
 all of these and put you on a list in 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.970
 a single list so we decided to 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.830
 insert two of the two most important ones 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.080
 two who do the research on behalf 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.350
 yours on all sites and giving i 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.450
 results in order of price then in 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.180
 this way you can find the with the cd 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 in play the cd key you are interested in is 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.050
 know exactly where to go to 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.000
 buy to pay as little as possible 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.430
 let's start from the first one that is dl with per 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.680
 of buying a very much archive 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.330
 very large of dealers from which 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.430
 to be able to draw precisely the CDs that i 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.890
 unfortunately, however, it has a game catalog 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.200
 very restricted is based above all 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.090
 on the latest releases or games that 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.250
 sell for the greater the benefit 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.920
 what is the advantage is that as we said 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.710
 first lets you search on all the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.490
 his suppliers or at least all his 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.500
 partner where you can find the fireplace 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.000
 lost more when we look for the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.650
 our game if in the list of games 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.690
 su dl con to appear at this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.700
 simbolino means that there will be one 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.920
 additional 5 percent discount will 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.600
 being 10 also by 20 depends on 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.010
 discount to get it we just have to 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 click on that symbol and we will come 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.460
 sent to a page where on 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.950
 left we will find a coupon with a 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.020
 promotional code to be inserted later on 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.300
 site where we are going to buy the cd dear 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.690
 let's move on to second service which is game 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.790
 that the finder allows to search 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.740
 as of the purchases in a whole 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.110
 database of online services that sell 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.450
 tell us what more you have in it 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.370
 many more games like indies like i 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.650
 games a little niche will be much more 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.660
 easy to find and view this kind of 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.880
 games compared to shopping 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.020
 obviously here too we would have been like one 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.270
 subdivision into letters where 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.620
 we will select our game and one 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.420
 once clicked on our game we will have 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.260
 the list of all the sites sell it a 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.520
 what price 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.970
 so let's start now with ours 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.230
 never buy tips that you have Russian 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.300
 if you are watching this video yes 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.400
 assumes that you are Italian then 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.130
 do not buy Russian because not only 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.870
 there is a language barrier but 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.510
 simply because the owners of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.680
 platforms like steam uplay origins e 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.440
 tell them about it 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.780
 often band not the Russian keys this 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.060
 because because in russia the keys 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.959
 are sold at bargain prices and 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.030
 to avoid a 10 Dec Russian withdrawal 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.260
 have decided to make these blocks 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.510
 obviously nothing is certain 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.910
 you can go unnoticed as you can 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.440
 be stuck as soon as you try to 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.970
 register us with that 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.810
 the advice we can give you is 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.380
 avoid spending maybe 12 euros more and 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.780
 buy the Italian or English gay cd o 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.520
 multi language but avoid the red ones 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.230
 also because you risk losing everything 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.790
 the account maybe in the account you have 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.270
 lots of registered games and it would be 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.980
 a shame 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.349
 obviously those two sites that we have there 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.110
 provided with to the purchases that in keyfinder 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.390
 are search engines among 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.910
 fair quotes 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.470
 discounts and bargain prices of course 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.500
 they do nothing but direct you 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.810
 to other sites with the discount you have 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.180
 searched then use common sense if 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.920
 you never bought on the internet 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.440
 Information how inquire whether 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.550
 that site is reliable or not looked at 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.140
 a bit of feedback 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.100
 don't go without fail if you don't 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.160
 never did so go there ie ours 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.570
 advice is calm if not if 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.340
 you are not sure 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.080
 ask before buying why 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.610
 are a myriad of different sites and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.500
 to know them all is practically 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.540
 impossible so maybe rely on 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.040
 feedback from kybit before you have 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.020
 bought something 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.000
 having said that we will see each other again next time 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.500
 bet to play while saving if you have 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.180
 advice on the subject from the deal 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.500
 write it in the comments 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.510

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.890

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.430

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.290
 to keep this video as a point of 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.120
 reference for such services mi 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.380

 bet where the question will be what is there 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.470
 wait for the new generation 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.360
 videogame now that xbox 360 e 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.700
