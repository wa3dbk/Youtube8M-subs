00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:26.450
 but today I bring you an English class 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:30.529
 neither are skills that we are in the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.810
 epoch but it is not a cake nor is it more 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.650
 common here if it's not all different than 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.650
 I'm sure you'll like it a lot 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.140
 there it is very usual and you can 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.960
 do with any result though 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.870
 traditional with cherries that's why they have 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.120
 prepare today with this fruit I'm going to 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.190
 make a single version that never 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.960
 has said to see how it was proven in the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.880
 dead larger as the square in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.890
 round as you want so you have to 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.239
 be careful to disassemble it because no 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.550
 It's a sponge cake that is demanded with 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.400
 ease so working please 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.400
 We will try a mobile phone delicately 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.910
 or else with baking paper if you like 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.080
 more for one we can give with ease 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.840
 then the teeth are very simple 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.630
 cream milk or cream from the country in the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.430
 I 'm being white sugar eggs 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.830
 a little to mind has as I said 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 for the molds there is a white beggar 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.730
 normal 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.590
 and then you can love an excerpt from 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.380
 vanilla that if you have why that is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.200
 fundamental and then the cherries that are 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.880
 the Queens 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.039
 and now I have all that pile of slopes 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.750
 appointments but I hope to teach here now 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.750
 accept as a couple 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.530
 Well, you have to bachoco on this day 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.980
 It's a normal pen that I've 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.680
 removed what is the ink and that of 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.830
 up laundry and we use to 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.210
 Bone our cherries with the side 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.870
 who has tradition or people to 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.209
 otherwise we press but if you do not 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.070
 with white clothes because you can put 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.890
 lost you see we are just going 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.170
 pushing the bone out 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.709
 and we have cherries and 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.270
 completely round and ready to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.050
 use is much faster than going 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.370
 cutting and removing the bone then what 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.470
 you do is that here you give me a 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.470
 little bit of water blows and knows everything 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.819
 I'm going to finish these cherries I wash the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.859
 hands and we start with the recipe 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.510
 let's mix this bowl you can do 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.389
 equal in thermomix more or less in one 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.790
 speed 34 following the same order no 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.520
 we need to put butterflies we are going to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.910
 mix the flour 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.220
 all salt flour 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 and with sugar but not with all the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.190
 double bass look like one more spoonful or 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.450
 less 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.450
 for the collective 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.870
 we mix 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.569
 the sounds that we add the eggs 1 1 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.250
 and 2 cause that I'm both going to add 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.020
 first 1 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.710
 and when it is fully integrated 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.710
 we add the other 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.540
 once in the East given the eggs we're going 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.540
 to add the liquids that is the cream 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.890
 and milk 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.640
 the milk to add it and we add it 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.830
 then the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.390
 in vanilla extract that as I have 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.000
 said before is not mandatory but it 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.270
 create a dot if it has a natural or 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.460
 without melting the milk 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.770
 in the night before for example or 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.840
 boil it and then that energy is a 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.150
 little more mess can be used the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.420
 vanilla extract one more spoonful or 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.420
 less 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.590
 we already have what is the preparation of 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.590
 our cake 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.560
 as I told you never of action 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.780
 individual or I do not know how much they will leave 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.510
 because they are a little bit bigger is 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.970
 really that for a person with this 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.860
 amount you have bread or some cake for 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.239
 6 people perfectly what I do not know if 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.239
 they will come out 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.430
 6 tarts I will try good 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.590
 we put what are the cherries well 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.669
 placed the way you like that 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.530
 Soaring a square mold is 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.289
 superchulo because you can put them 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.259
 perfectly aligned and then they come out 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.830
 some pretty pieces and what we do 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:38.229
 then cover it with the cream that 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.550
 we have done is not high up because 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.400
 As you can see, it's a pretty big 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.050
 tartlets so they saved us a 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.509
 folder and very very large 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.780
 start to good compression of 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.280
 silicones and what is still greased that 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.240
 is the oven that we have already hot to 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.150
 180 degrees okay I'll try with 4 am and 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.360
 how it goes and we reach after pouring 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.430
 the mixture of the molds is only in the 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.710
 oven the sugar that we have booked goes to 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.280
 be for when they are already cooked 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.280
 our fruits 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.400
 here you have our skin of these 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.230
 impressive we can declare it with 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.150
 sugar in degree as I told you when 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.270
 are hot today this time 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.090
 put a little icing sugar for 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.699
 over 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.310
 I get off a little bit but this is the idea 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.610
 but the decoration is quite simple 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.010
 and you will like it as commented before 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.139
 this dessert gave place for a person 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.870
 or if you want to share with a little bit of 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.720
 whipped cream would say great or even a 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.669
 ice cream scoop to the super summer that 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.010
 you think this our comments and 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.110
 leave me a like I like the recipe 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.300
 You can also come to see me 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.780
 facebook twitter and good instagram 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.780
 until next time
