00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
could come with the kind of job like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.649 
could come with the kind of job like
this<00:01:45.890> no<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> mean<00:01:47.729> he<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.509> in

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
this no I don't think so I mean he is in

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
this no I don't think so I mean he is in
a<00:01:48.930> fortunate<00:01:49.320> position<00:01:49.380> where<00:01:49.860> he<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> should

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
a fortunate position where he I should

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.410 
a fortunate position where he I should
have<00:01:50.850> homeschool<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.810> rather<00:01:52.560> than<00:01:53.210> maybe<00:01:54.210> see

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
have homeschool so rather than maybe see

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
have homeschool so rather than maybe see
a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.630> bit<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.020> conventional<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
a little bit in conventional kind of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.190 
a little bit in conventional kind of
speech<00:01:56.640> therapy<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.329> seems<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> work<00:01:57.960> for

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
speech therapy but it seems to work for

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.929 
speech therapy but it seems to work for
him<00:01:58.320> cause<00:01:58.439> he<00:01:58.500> doesn't<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:59.490> bored<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.880> tired

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
him cause he doesn't get bored or tired

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.490 
him cause he doesn't get bored or tired
practicing<00:02:00.689> doing<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.259> he<00:02:01.380> actually

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
practicing doing it because he actually

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
practicing doing it because he actually
has<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> genuine<00:02:02.460> interest<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.850> doing<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
has a genuine interest in doing it and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.999 
has a genuine interest in doing it and
it's<00:02:04.140> quite<00:02:04.259> interesting<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
it's quite interesting for the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.069 
it's quite interesting for the
imagination<00:02:05.610> isn't<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
imagination isn't it this because it's a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.719 
imagination isn't it this because it's a
boy<00:02:07.259> who<00:02:07.469> uses<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.829> device<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.160> turn<00:02:08.489> into

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
boy who uses a device to turn into

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.430 
boy who uses a device to turn into
different<00:02:08.819> aliens<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.720> sort<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.200> really

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
different aliens it's sort of it really

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.370
