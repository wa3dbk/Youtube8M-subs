00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 the alarm is in danger to see to be 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.379
 in the world and already the possibility 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.139
 also to fight for being the scorer of 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.780
 this championship and these five matches 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.849
 to take it with the greatest seriousness and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.090
 finish in the best way the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.369
 championship giving a better image to what 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.150
 that we are living and try that the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.210
 team finish better positioned kingfisher 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.029
 we are live for 90 minutes in fox 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.560
 sports your record was a bit off 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.360
 because you yourself said you felt 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.320
 uncomfortable with the theme of the celebration 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.990
 it happened already I kept chewing that 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.270
 it would have been better in another way than 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.150
 It would have been better to leave it 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.030
 forms and I do not think that 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.570
 the important thing would have been to turn everything 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.020
 about the event that of the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.940
 miracle of what I had gotten from what 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.820
 that everything was waiting was maybe 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.280
 many weeks that were 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.800
 going on and talking about when I was going to do 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.800
 the day of the record later I surely know 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.890
 was implemented after the game something 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.170
 it had happened that I already talked about it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.520
 I think it's a topic that for me 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 closed and and there is evidence of what 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.619
 he went inside the court but nothing else 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.310
 I do not have about that to clarify 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.620
 nothing or justify anything I think what 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.070
 more important than I could 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.230
 to analyze personally is to have arrived 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.320
 to the record 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.780
 this weapon that was the cutest thing that I 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.510
 happened and with all the mouth people that 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.070
 I also enjoy it very much trying 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.650
 to find explanations to that 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.750
 celebration begins to talk about a 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.120
 meeting on Sunday afternoon then 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.880
 of training with members of the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.940
 swollen what can I say about that yes 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.810
 it existed yes yes yes it was made they are 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.990
 issues that I do not have no reason why 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.050
 have to clarify 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.730
 or justify after what happened 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:21.180
 inside the court I talk about what 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.660
 happened and with regard to the other are 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.260
 things that have come out that have been said 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.020
 but good if nobody saw it or nobody was 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.750
 part of that by those who 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.180
 maybe they could say it I'm not going to 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.730
 speak to me then what today 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.910
 Today I'm interested and I try to talk 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.750
 about the moment he touched me live 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.890
 after so much waiting for it and it 's something 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.370
 only that maybe I will not go back to 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.010
 live because this is it personally 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.310
 a unique achievement 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.170
 that not many have the privilege of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.439
 achieve will not have achieved iron in its 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.860
 When I played, I also played 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:14.129
 pass it but the post what else that 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.430
 surrounds the circumstance that was at the 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:21.209
 no, I will not comment and my point of view 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.849
 view and for each one analyze to take out 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.280
 your own conclusions conjectures but 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.989
 I 'm not talking about that anymore 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.239
 martín we are united by thesis is by 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.770
 in sportia how is your relationship today with 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.040
 riquelme 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.680
 what I said yesterday is the only thing that unites us 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.680
 is to go out on the court to have the same 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.500
 T-shirt give everything by mouth nothing else 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.320
 we have another relationship we do not have dialogue 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.110
 a good day respect 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.010
 hello that such nothing else is that the only thing 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.910
 that for today does not relate and then I think 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.950
 that we are two references we are examples 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.800
 for the little ones and that when we left 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.430
 on the court we try to do our best and 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.860
 each one contributes from his place all 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.240
 for the team you always decide what 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.880
 you want to retire to a mouth shirt 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.160
 the president just recently in 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.830
 that place said there is the decision of 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.830
 renew them to palermo and riquelme tenés 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.360
 intention to follow in the mouth sure yes yes 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.170
 It's the desire and I keep it 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.930
 always to finish my career in the 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.690
 I've been doing it for three years 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.800
 renovations back I did it with Mauricio 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.750
 with pedro last year with Jorge 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.699
 and why I'm not going to keep 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.190
 that always in every renewal existed or 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.800
 maybe it showed that I could 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.569
 go to another place or that there was 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.879
 possibilities I always said no 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.879
 they go through the economic or nothing happens 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:57.449
 the desire to end up in the club where 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:00.270
 win everything where today I am inside 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.069
 of history for something that I got and 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.080
 I want to finish at the club with the 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.090
 mouth shirt are happy are you 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.509
 happy today at this moment that they are 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.169
 living in the mouth because it's weird or 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:15.509
 On the one hand, it passes to iron , 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.409
 maximum of the story but like no 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:22.080
 everything was complete I think no one is 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.259
 today, having the best time and 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.009
 enjoying the situation that is being 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.719
 living 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.180
 I think I see mouth in the position that 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:33.000
 is in the protagonists of the 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.590
 championship watching the Copa Libertadores 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.970
 By television 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.490
 they are all things that we are not 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.910
 accustomed and the fan or us 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.990
 because we have a malacostumbramos 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.240
 greater role then I think the 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.610
 concern goes through everything for the 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.340
 leaders by the technicians who have 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.360
 gone through us the players in the 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.180
 which we are missing something and then 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.120
 you do not enjoy it is not complete no no no 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.780
 you enjoy winning a game and 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.390
 then lose three or lose four and 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.430
 I think that we are not used to 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.560
 then you do not work quietly in the 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:18.690
 week there is no harmony that leaves you 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:23.160
 think how good next Sunday 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:26.490
 will continue adding results and that adds up 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.950
 confidence to add a level of play that 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.130
 we have not shown it then it does 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.640
 that this is not in tune as 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.640
 we all want
