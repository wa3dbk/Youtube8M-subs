00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
then you play a flat a flat C E and then

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.490 
then you play a flat a flat C E and then
G<00:02:58.120> see<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.660> can't<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.110> whole<00:03:02.349> three

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
this one only so a flat G a flat C GC

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.130 
this one only so a flat G a flat C GC
unlike<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.300> other<00:03:10.510> hand<00:03:10.840> where<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.020> play

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
to C or D flat sorry D flat F and a flat

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.990 
to C or D flat sorry D flat F and a flat
then<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.670> go<00:03:30.760> up<00:03:30.790> one<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.769> my<00:03:33.150> G<00:03:34.150> be<00:03:35.019> right<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.710 

you

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.930 

ok

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
ok

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.880 
ok
now<00:03:50.630> for<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.900> vs<00:03:51.260> it's<00:03:51.410> pretty<00:03:51.560> much<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.770> same

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
now for the vs it's pretty much the same

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.900

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
switch my G C

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.460 
switch my G C
then<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.870> go<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.459> D<00:04:17.459> flat<00:04:17.669> um<00:04:18.600> f<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:20.030> flat<00:04:21.470> so

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.040 

the<00:04:29.850> run<00:04:29.970> over<00:04:30.120> those<00:04:30.210> opening<00:04:30.630> moment<00:04:30.990> I'm

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
the run over those opening moment I'm

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.150 
the run over those opening moment I'm
it's<00:04:31.229> so<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:32.009> F<00:04:32.490> D<00:04:33.240> or<00:04:33.509> F<00:04:33.569> a<00:04:34.050> flat<00:04:34.289> C

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.340 

you<00:04:38.160> flag<00:04:38.460> GC

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
you flag GC

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.860 
you flag GC
then<00:04:40.950> it's<00:04:41.100> D<00:04:41.880> flat<00:04:42.150> F<00:04:42.420> a<00:04:42.810> flat

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
then it's D flat F a flat

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.750 
then it's D flat F a flat
so<00:04:45.410> here's<00:04:45.590> our<00:04:45.650> celtics<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.370> verse<00:04:46.520> sounds

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
so here's our celtics the verse sounds

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:56.700 
so here's our celtics the verse sounds
like

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.020
