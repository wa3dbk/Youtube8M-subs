00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.220
 today two barendrecht against FC 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.410
 lisse and stylists that plays with 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.019
 mourning tires because Mr. Overevest of the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.599
 association deceased is only a real one 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.309
 heavy looking for points because the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.379
 the first two games both 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.130
 zero point on life lessons start what 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.880
 better with two out of two values ​​with many 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.220
 injuries between adjusted team 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.109
 what is the delano craco here and in it again 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.420
 the team is an excellent langewal 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.960
 where mark de vries looks at and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.239
 it is only maurits that the ball can 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 of insertion but that is a bit too far 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.850
 turned to the side in for that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.850
 this doesn't work out 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.000
 re- purchase in who tried the ball 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.000
 to bring in read them conquered to the ball 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.489
 tries to defend but it is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.890
 over there 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.770
 via girls with sure your eyes that are possible 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.280
 from opening to us everything brings the ball 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.230
 give birth to left to daniel esajas 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.809
 who brings excellent action to the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.760
 ball in and it's staring at the video 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.799
 we have to return to their own language 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.770
 a chest that entitles you to within 6 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.420
 minutes to draw an excellent 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.939
 start for barendrecht because anyway 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.640
 strong source here quickly comes to a 0 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.280
 the animal john man who 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.479
 Luydens yesterday is on the left 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 Laurens fishing does go inside 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.530
 lice strong right leg always 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.189
 and that ball that just got over 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 violation on bob 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.479
 take deeply on daniel esajas that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.729
 and there has been the keeper 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.729
 mark the freeze that parry the ball 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.780
 as said Barendrecht 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.659
 strong but gradually after the goal was 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.979
 erase the field game inherited worst 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.320
 yet it was barendrecht what every 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.600
 times dangerous came out like here with 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.990
 the danielle dull when they fling 16 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.479
 but Mark de Vries came the ball 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.079
 simply from a moment later to the other 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.369
 side 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.989
 free kick for lessons via method and 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.690
 the body bounces dangerously in the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.150
 tool mouth 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.070
 and the atari can not use there 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.270
 out of it 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.770
 and that ball is concealed and 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.770
 ultimately at the expense of a corner 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.720
 the danger is passed over how long you are 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.970
 ball on a heap of buffer coin that 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.650
 brings the ball excellent for a must 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.520
 bas my this you actually the two zeros 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.140
 to draw my head the ball next to 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.680
 moments later on the other side it dog 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.270
 game waved back and forth here can tons 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.000
 sons are excellent for that 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.130
 opponent come but the shot 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.290
 yes, that mark tellers cannot a 'with it 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.710
 instill 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.220
 then it's lisse over the left side again 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.820
 brings the trees hangari 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.400
 but the middle is something about that 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.380
 Cocoa came over the left again 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.170
 and a bad pass garibaldi 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.060
 bounces twice to the bar and then 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.910
 for sure say looks somewhat on that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.710
 ball and stop danger 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.860
 good block of maurits can therefore 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.020
 defend the jolly young man 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.330
 who is welcome at Bob and steers 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.120
 to laurens fisherman away laurens fisherman 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.340
 goes in the 16 again shoots who tries 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.690
 with markers over the freezer 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.220
 but of course just not good hammond 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.840
 Will played today for him 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.430
 strange left back position but did that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280
 excellent 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.590
 bring it to esajas and then get it 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.769
 so everything from back is free 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.370
 good shot but well parried by the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.370
 dries 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.510
 who grabbed many balls from the many chances 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.090
 who got barendrecht in the first half 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.600
 then it is now in injury time of 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.000
 the first half corner barendrecht and 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.760
 then a person is much in control there 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.620
 of the ton, this ball is just the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.090
 you don't see it 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.650
 and therefore it remains a 0 a pair of 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.870
 second half 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.599
 but Lisse should go looking for it 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.909
 make an equal 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.699
 they also immediately go a number 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.470
 also to brecht spy vermeulen gives the 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.220
 ball for but tellers can the ball 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.220
 easy to catch 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.660
 moments later salas tries to clear the ball 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.330
 to work 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.940
 but with about 20 duels it brings construction 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.800
 for the sea the ball stopped but ak that 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.900
 came in which 16 that can lash 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.900
 and that ball that just passes 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.590
 danger of lisse here it is all mine 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.060
 does not indicate a good play ball 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.100
 on aon 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.810
 yes and then it is there from the mountain that 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.240
 has an excellent opportunity that must 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.669
 ball actually resemble atari 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.910
 he does not and therefore comes 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.410
 barendrecht with the fright free 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.900
 moments later a mistake it 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.699
 in the back and as a result 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.830
 Laurens Fisherman Enable Esajas 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.830
 that it concerns the action and come so 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.080
 therefore on typical of the rising and 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.539
 The one that keeps me away from is Ajax 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.039
 it is a penalty for barendrecht 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.530
 and that is easily through the middle 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.910
 shot by arriving and sitting now 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:25.419
 200 barendrecht barendrecht on rose 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.370
 escort had the 2 0 plus here in the second 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.990
 half a bit more effort to complete the game 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.800
 the way they do in the first half 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.479
 did what barendrecht what what 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.490
 easier to play football 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.580
 a good shot to an action from here 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.419
 which about gastel but it is again the 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.740
 freeze that the construction reverses gradually 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.139
 of course it goes on in that 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.090
 last 20 minutes 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.650
 you teach wooden ball before and then 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.150
 the ball is shot by to agree 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.229
 but that tree is about to clear up 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.270
 then badly defending from 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.159
 defending lisse 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.970
 so again fisherman who can leave 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.470
 shoot but shoot over the sights of 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.449
 clowns in didn't get up today 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.639
 a good number on practice-oriented scanning 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.889
 shoot come 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.169
 then it is again fast than your 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.939
 science that is one-on-one with the 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.490
 defender played him excellent 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:22.949
 but it is stable mark de vries peter 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.479
 excellent party not only on the 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.469
 but also for the goal, he did well 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.430
 agree that defensible and beyond 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.469
 can grab 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.659
 anyway man brings laurens there and again 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.249
 fisherman setting that shoots and in this 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.909
 case that is probably better for bob 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:41.550
 we can choose where the ball is that 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:43.379
 Holes believe things 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.750
 here for a chance of lisse 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.340
 just before the end we go to the 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.219
 last minutes 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.400
 excellent ball there and there and there 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:54.779
 the substitute of lisse and actually being 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.360
 here they are closest to the goal the 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:59.009
 bottom of the bar bounce door out 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.449
 You were also there is not than 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.460
 Barendrecht actually that they are here 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.699
 dragging in a competition like this 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.139
 heat freezing during injury time 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.000
 only mistake you might be 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.710
 substitute marwin richard none can 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.300
 make use of 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.379
 to hit the ball in the empty goal 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.330
 shoot 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:16.500
 so it goes well to the end 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.599
 for barendrecht and go barendrecht 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.389
 recorded the first victory here 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:22.680
 half to three points and job can 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.889
 a bit quieter that it also goes ice 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.889
 look
