ounces<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> mechanism<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.800> frame

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
ounces and then the mechanism is frame

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.650 
ounces and then the mechanism is frame
lock<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.539> locks<00:01:00.800> like<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.660> it's

i think it let me zoom out a little bit

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.510 
i think it let me zoom out a little bit
i<00:01:29.210> think<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:31.560> great<00:01:31.920> knife<00:01:32.159> for

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.910 
i think it's a really great knife for
the<00:01:32.640> price<00:01:32.909> there's<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.869> smaller<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the price there's a smaller one of this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.850 
the price there's a smaller one of this
for<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.280> ten<00:01:35.790> dollars<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.799> one

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
for about ten dollars but I got this one

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
for about ten dollars but I got this one
because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.700> thought<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.390> would<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600

hands<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.170> don't<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.040> begins<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> don't<00:02:24.850> do

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
hands I don't have begins so I don't do

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.730 
hands I don't have begins so I don't do
it<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.090> way<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.810> third<00:02:25.990> way<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.200> open<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.620> is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
it that way the third way to open it is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.490 
it that way the third way to open it is
again<00:02:27.010> using<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.730> little<00:02:28.060> knob<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:29.020> open<00:02:29.410> it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
again using this little knob you open it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.240 
again using this little knob you open it
a<00:02:29.590> little<00:02:29.620> bit<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:30.220> flick<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.360> out<00:02:32.250> so

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
a little bit and then flick it out so

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.670 
a little bit and then flick it out so
yes<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.700> does<00:02:33.850> flick<00:02:34.090> out<00:02:34.270> but<00:02:34.600> not<00:02:34.960> from

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
yes it does flick out but not from

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.770 
yes it does flick out but not from
closed<00:02:36.100> position<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.540> closed

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
closed position like if I have it closed

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.610 
closed position like if I have it closed
it's<00:02:38.230> not<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.040> flick<00:02:39.550> out<00:02:39.700> um<00:02:40.620> so

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
it's not just going to flick out um so

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's not just going to flick out um so
what<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.830> need<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.070> do<00:02:42.220> again<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.000> just

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
what you need to do again like I just

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.170 
what you need to do again like I just
said<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:44.350> pull<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.740> little<00:02:44.770> bit<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.340> then

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
said just pull it a little bit and then

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.510 
said just pull it a little bit and then
flick<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.510> out<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.860> look<00:02:48.100> like<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.460> from

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
flick it out it can look like it's from

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.010 
flick it out it can look like it's from
closed<00:02:48.850> position<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.810> really<00:02:49.900> fast

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
closed position if you do it really fast

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.070 
closed position if you do it really fast
like<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.750> said<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.050> doesn't

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
like this so it like I said it doesn't

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.050 
like this so it like I said it doesn't
actually<00:02:56.470> go<00:02:56.740> from<00:02:56.950> closed<00:02:57.160> position<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:57.940> it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
actually go from closed position but it

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.460 
actually go from closed position but it
can<00:02:58.330> look<00:02:58.570> like<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.320> do<00:02:59.440> it

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
can look like it if you just do it

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.850 
can look like it if you just do it
really<00:02:59.620> fast<00:02:59.740> and<00:03:00.190> if<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.270> see<00:03:01.709> when<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.830> open

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
really fast and if you see when you open

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.740 
really fast and if you see when you open
it<00:03:03.390> that's<00:03:04.390> how<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.750> locks<00:03:05.020> is<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:07.420> little

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
it that's how it locks is this little

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.229 
it that's how it locks is this little
river<00:03:09.239> goes<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.540> side<00:03:10.780> when<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:12.180> open<00:03:13.180> it

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
river goes to the side when you open it

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.940 
river goes to the side when you open it
so<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.620> way<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.830> close<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:16.950> push

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
so the way you close it is you just push

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.460 
so the way you close it is you just push
it<00:03:17.980> back<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.950> close<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.959> be<00:03:23.140> open

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
it back and close it so it can be open

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.410 
it back and close it so it can be open
with<00:03:23.500> one<00:03:23.950> hand<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.380> let's<00:03:26.380> just<00:03:26.620> have<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.800> open

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
with one hand so let's just have it open

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.870 
with one hand so let's just have it open
push<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.540> with<00:03:28.630> your<00:03:28.690> thumb<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.370> go<00:03:30.550> like<00:03:30.700> that

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
push it with your thumb and go like that

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.250 
push it with your thumb and go like that
so<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.870> pretty<00:03:32.140> easy<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.680> open<00:03:32.920> close<00:03:33.400> and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
so it is pretty easy to open close and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.970 
so it is pretty easy to open close and
one<00:03:35.260> more<00:03:35.500> thing<00:03:35.530> about<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.370> knife<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.940> that

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
one more thing about this knife is that

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.170 
one more thing about this knife is that
this<00:03:38.980> little<00:03:39.370> part<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:40.500> not<00:03:41.500> sharp<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.580> mean<00:03:43.150> I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180
