00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.440 
three drawers right the way it works is
if<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.409> win<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> first<00:01:47.159> drone<00:01:47.610> challenge<00:01:48.090> but

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
if you win the first drone challenge but

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990 
if you win the first drone challenge but
you<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> drone<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.490> catch<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you get a drone but the catch is you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.210 
you get a drone but the catch is you
have<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.899> what<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.040> say<00:01:53.189> right

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
have to do what so you have to say right

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
have to do what so you have to say right
I'm<00:01:53.729> gonna<00:01:53.880> keep<00:01:54.149> my<00:01:54.210> drone<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.259> gonna<00:01:55.380> go

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
I'm gonna keep my drone and I'm gonna go

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.160 
I'm gonna keep my drone and I'm gonna go
home<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.219> gonna<00:01:56.969> take<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> second<00:01:57.899> course

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
home or I'm gonna take the second course

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.800 
home or I'm gonna take the second course
and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> might<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.490> fail<00:01:59.759> lose<00:02:00.420> my<00:02:00.600> first

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and then I might if I fail lose my first

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.230 
and then I might if I fail lose my first
roan<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.799> win<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> drones<00:02:02.759> so

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
roan but if I win I get to drones so

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.179 
roan but if I win I get to drones so
basically<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:04.079> happens<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> win<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
basically what happens is if you win the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.830 
basically what happens is if you win the
first<00:02:05.399> challenge<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> drone<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.689> can
