00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
songs and I I realized that they did

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
songs and I I realized that they did
that<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> new<00:00:49.530> co-op

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that because of the new co-op

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
that because of the new co-op
multiplayer<00:00:50.129> mode<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:51.000> allows<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.449> player

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
multiplayer mode which allows the player

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.139 
multiplayer mode which allows the player
