 hello with you technical reviews 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.150
 astroscope labs 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.490
 I'm Victor Leonidov probably every 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.150
 man has a clear idea of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.820
 what is a microscope but not many 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.250
 know about digital microscopes which 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.730
 open up new opportunities 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.530
 Today your attention is invited to 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.930

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.720
 microscope button is the same 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.509
 serves to change the digital 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.520
 one to four times 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:05.330

 optical change slider 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.950
 increase 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.510

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.990
 The ok button is used to record video and photos. 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.960
 there are lugs on the sides of the device 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.140
 mounts 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.820
 strap most likely it is intended to 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.700
 wearing around his neck turned the microscope we 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.190
 see a lens equipped with its four 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.540
 LED element illumination and 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.290
 the focus system is located near 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.600
 connector for mounting the stage 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.260
 on the subject table is present 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.110
 additional focusing mechanism is 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.400
 this microscope is no more than 150 grams and 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:31.560
 completely fit in the hand and so 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.830
 turn on the device and immediately go to 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.950

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.620
 move through the menu by two 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.070
 buttons on the right display and the main menu 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.620
 contains the following sections 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.260
 record video take a single shot 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.080
 take a series of shots 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.280
 exposure adjustment and additional 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.490
 Settings for selecting the desired partition 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.710
 press the open button with this 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.670
 the same buttons can be and I will change 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.680
 microscope 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.140
 chose pictograph and gzip go back to 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.810
 shooting mode and select the object 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.260
 observations use a microscope can 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.170
 both with the subject table and without it 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.140
 just putting or putting on 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.270
 observable pattern optical change 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.480
 increase done by 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.850
 slider on the front of the device and 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.960
 change of digital multiplicity 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.360
 photo and video enable button 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.650
 written to a card or built-in 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.980
 memory if the microscope under bakes pda then 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.110
 data is saved to hard disk for 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.240
 view the results 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.800
 you must press the lower right button 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.860
 on the front of the microscope 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.970
 to connect the device 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.110
 must first be in the menu 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.610
 microscope select the mode stop 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:18.230
 otherwise the microscope does not work 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:21.590
 will be the magnification range of the microscope from 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.920
 three and a half to 140 times the maximum 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.490
 possible resolution for photo 1600 on 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.340
 1200 pixels for video 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.150
 the device works in two formats you 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.080
 same q and you both format gives very 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.080
 decent picture 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.610
 LED backlight is bright enough 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.290
 due to which the observed sample 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.110
 gets the necessary degree 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.510
 illumination but focusing 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.300
 carried out very roughly it 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:58.010
 essentially prevents getting pictures 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:00.800
 good quality l sits 2 and 4 10 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.410
 inch or 6 cm display 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.040
 allows you to comfortably view photos and 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.800
 video 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.580
 and also makes navi 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.860
 fathers on the microscope menu quite convenient 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.680
 resolution settings and picture quality 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.199
 can be rebuilt as through the camera menu 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.720
 so and through a special program on 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:24.639
 the computer that comes with the disk 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.770
 photo processing functions and 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.740
 photomizer video 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.530
 very meager you can change 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.190
 image resolution its format and 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:39.280
 set process scaling type 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.139
 installation is very simple and intuitive 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.240
 is understandable 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.479
 just press the button continuously further and 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.159
 the driver becomes self then 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.979
 need to install the program 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:54.460
 view photomizer photo video 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.800
 Alas, but the complete version of the program is not 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:01.110
 allows you to view images and 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.110
 video on full computer screen 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.490
 conclusion I want to say that the microscope 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.360
 left very pleasant about myself 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.029
 impression 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.150
 image and video quality 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:17.629
 very decent daytime navigation 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.749
 Intuitive and easy high 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:22.939
 constructive and quality device 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:25.069
 glass lens lens and all that 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:28.150
 advantage of this microscope 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:30.529
 if you are repairing 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.749
 high-precision soldering and you need 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:34.870
 evaluate its quality work and in 

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:37.520
 jewelry workshop either 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.110
 dental laboratory are fond of 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.830
 collecting 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:45.110
 then bresser hank hill will be useful to you 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.870
 feeds the microscope and for home 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.180
 use any bug leaf 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.330
 pebble and much more brought from 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.819
 streets and children can easily explore 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.309
 Yes, and probably every adult will 

00:07:55.819 --> 00:08:00.139
 interesting to play with this device 

00:07:58.309 --> 00:08:01.490
 you had a technical review from 

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:06.009
 astroscope labs 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.009
 see you soon in our store
