00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 live 3 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.240
 many were waiting for many were afraid and everything 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.910
 why and because the developers decided 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.000
 affect the players for the holiest of 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.640
 kv-1s and for hellcat will have you all 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.349
 said and here is what we give 18 I'm not sure 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.720
 let's see what are you 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.910
 represented the witch before almost 9 and 3 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
 due to the complete absence of booking 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.599
 in the case of its mass in the amount of good 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.520
 the engine gave him the opportunity to be 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.739
 very mobile on the map and act 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.570
 like a medium tank the presence of a tower is very 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.580
 seriously expanded the capabilities of the tank 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.620
 good weapon with good damage in 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.450
 a minute allowed a lot of damage 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.940
 Gold breakthroughs fight tanks 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.010
 even 10 levels of vertical guidance 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.990
 high speed back class 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.850
 masking ratio for pc and excellent 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.329
 review allowed him not to take damage by 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.010
 to myself 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.410
 developers have solved this problem 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.210
 in its own way all the changes are very 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.280
 significantly reduced the comfort of playing on 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.699
 tank let's go through each 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.020
 change separately 1 damage per minute 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.299
 frankly his change is so 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.130
 seriously, our recharge has become 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.750
 about half a second longer 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.540
 if i use rammer i 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.790
 I consider not so serious the second moment 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.740
 mobility first entering the test right away 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.049
 there was a feeling that something was wrong 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.000
 either the wrong gasoline was poured into the tank 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.190
 either we started driving around kissel because 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.600
 that the tank became less dynamic during acceleration 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.610
 power density itself 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.900
 still remained high 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.880
 but maneuverability was 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.640
 somewhat bitten which entailed 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.409
 a decrease in mobility and if the first 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 two points not so seriously affected 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.320
 on the general gameplay 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.840
 then the third and fourth in my opinion 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.909
 the most significant is about 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.040
 stabilization and speed and reverse 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.869
 if earlier when turning the body our 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.000
 the range of information was not too large and 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.280
 you could even afford to shoot 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.380
 without waiting for it to end now 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.450
 any movement of the tower and even more so 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.760
 hull increases appeared to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.710
 huge size is now dynamic 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.299
 battle shooting substantial below because 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.310
 will have to spend either significantly more 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.020
 time for a guaranteed shot either 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.629
 make it almost random 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.420
 well, the latest and almost the most 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.950
 significant speed back never 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.409
 I probably wouldn't say that this parameter 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.150
 important but now after the shot tank 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.720
 awfully moves back 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.310
 if earlier it was possible under 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.440
 Do you need a quick shot after 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540
 which even lit roll for 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.920
 the hill and you this visibility limits 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.960
 now the probability of such a maneuver 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.580
 significantly reduced because for 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.410
 the time of our care tank can 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.330
 fly back with a man 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.240
 recoil lice 950 fights on this unit 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.730
 I can safely say what exactly it made 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.500
 the greatest discomfort in the game let you down 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.420
 totals to change each of four 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.190
 points influenced the overall dynamics and 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.320
 the audacity of the game on the tank so 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.090
 the ability to effectively deal damage 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.800
 my mind there 18 will become balanced not 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.330
 so many of the other parameters that 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.320
 will cease to allow showed very 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.850
 high scores 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.560
 how much due to so much 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.280
 experienced players to drive them all 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.230
 sixth level 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.360
 just stop playing it though 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.680
 I repeat this is just my personal opinion in 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.900
 the result is now the sixth level has become 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.430
 more or less balance between themselves about their 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.430
 wolves maniac all good luck and bye
