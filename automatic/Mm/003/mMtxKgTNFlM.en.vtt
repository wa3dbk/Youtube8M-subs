00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the action is going to be higher and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.979

to talk briefly about these licks so you
can<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.969> categorize<00:00:42.450> them<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.899> you'll

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
can kind of categorize them and you'll

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
can kind of categorize them and you'll
know<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.320> you're<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.500> against<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.789> the

most common licks you'll see again will

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.520 
most common licks you'll see again will
be<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.340> back<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> key<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.350> we<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
be go back to the key of a we got a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
be go back to the key of a we got a
minor<00:00:49.950> pentatonic<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> blue<00:00:51.390> scale

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
minor pentatonic and the a blue scale

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.529 
minor pentatonic and the a blue scale
where<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.170> throw<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> flat<00:00:52.890> five<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.640> very

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
where we throw in that flat five a very

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.830 
where we throw in that flat five a very
common<00:00:55.079> opening<00:00:55.829> lick<00:00:56.070> would<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.460> four<00:00:57.090> then

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
common opening lick would be four then

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.860 
common opening lick would be four then
either<00:00:58.170> 25<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:59.070> two<00:00:59.190> flat<00:00:59.489> five<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
either 25 or two flat five then you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.000 
either 25 or two flat five then you
immediately<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.559> five<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> one

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
immediately go to the five and the one

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.260 
immediately go to the five and the one
it's<00:01:05.010> kind<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> phrase<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.060> know

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it's kind of like the phrase you know

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.030 
it's kind of like the phrase you know
that's<00:01:06.540> used<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.080> over<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that's used and over you so much in

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.899 
that's used and over you so much in
English<00:01:08.250> language<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.150> ligand<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.729> see

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
English language this ligand so you see

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.100 
English language this ligand so you see
what<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.119> doing<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.659> goes<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
what I'm doing there it goes back to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
what I'm doing there it goes back to
that<00:01:16.200> theme<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.680> variations<00:01:17.159> idea<00:01:17.549> play<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that theme and variations idea play that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
that theme and variations idea play that
lick<00:01:23.960> wherever<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:26.070> anyway

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
lick wherever you want to go but anyway

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
lick wherever you want to go but anyway
back<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> technique<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> play<00:01:27.720> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
back to the technique when you play this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.740 
back to the technique when you play this
lick<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:29.189> can't<00:01:29.490> bend<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.479> first

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
lick you can't bend with that first

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.899 
lick you can't bend with that first
finger<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> dampening<00:01:31.710> posture<00:01:32.189> because

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
finger in the dampening posture because

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.280 
finger in the dampening posture because
then<00:01:33.210> you'd<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.570> move<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> over<00:01:33.930> it's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then you'd have to move it over it's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260 
then you'd have to move it over it's
inefficient<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.100> also<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.579> lose<00:01:35.939> leverage

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
inefficient and also you lose leverage

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.690 
inefficient and also you lose leverage
remember<00:01:36.780> i<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> term<00:01:37.200> earlier<00:01:37.860> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
remember i use that term earlier so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.030 
remember i use that term earlier so
again<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> setup<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.770> riff

know<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.290> there's<00:02:23.590> another<00:02:23.800> issue<00:02:24.069> here<00:02:24.750> when

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
know and there's another issue here when

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.250 
know and there's another issue here when
you<00:02:26.760> when<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.790> release<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> fretted<00:02:28.780> note<00:02:28.810> it's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
you when you release a fretted note it's

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.199 
you when you release a fretted note it's
really<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.590> two<00:02:29.830> part<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.250> fair<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.640> see<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> lot<00:02:31.150> of

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
really a two part of fair I see a lot of

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.550 
really a two part of fair I see a lot of
my<00:02:31.420> students<00:02:31.870> doing<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.200> sort<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.470> thing

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
my students doing this sort of thing

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.800 
my students doing this sort of thing
they'll<00:02:32.800> play<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.130> up<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.120> they<00:02:34.300> yank<00:02:34.630> their

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
they'll play it up and they yank their

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.930 
they'll play it up and they yank their
finger<00:02:35.140> off<00:02:35.260> almost<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.800> if<00:02:35.950> they<00:02:36.100> suddenly

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
finger off almost as if they suddenly

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.640 
finger off almost as if they suddenly
were<00:02:37.239> touching<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.660> 200-degree<00:02:38.050> piece<00:02:38.500> of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
were touching a 200-degree piece of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.840 
were touching a 200-degree piece of
metal<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:41.080> what<00:02:41.260> happens<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.610> string

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
metal and what happens is the string

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.309 
metal and what happens is the string
sticks<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.269> your<00:02:43.330> flesh<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.840> get<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> ghost

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
sticks to your flesh and you get a ghost

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.140 
sticks to your flesh and you get a ghost
open<00:02:44.739> string<00:02:45.010> or<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.250> brush<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.790> pull<00:02:46.030> it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
open string or you brush it you pull it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.090 
open string or you brush it you pull it
you<00:02:46.269> get<00:02:46.390> kind<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.780> quasi<00:02:47.200> pull<00:02:47.530> off<00:02:47.709> right

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
you get kind of a quasi pull off right

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.759 
you get kind of a quasi pull off right
that's<00:02:48.610> no<00:02:48.850> good<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.840> practice<00:02:50.170> playing

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
that's no good so practice playing

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.680 
that's no good so practice playing
staccato<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:54.670> don't<00:02:54.880> pick<00:02:55.060> your<00:02:55.180> fingers<00:02:55.510> up
