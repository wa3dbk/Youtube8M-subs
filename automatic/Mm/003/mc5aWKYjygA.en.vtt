especially<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> full-frame<00:00:20.039> camera<00:00:20.520> it'll

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
especially on a full-frame camera it'll

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.040 
especially on a full-frame camera it'll
work<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> 1.6<00:00:22.980> crop<00:00:23.550> factor<00:00:23.699> body<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
work on a 1.6 crop factor body but it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
work on a 1.6 crop factor body but it
really<00:00:25.410> shines<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> full-frame<00:00:26.609> sensors

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
really shines on the full-frame sensors

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750 
really shines on the full-frame sensors
like<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> 5d<00:00:28.019> mark<00:00:28.619> ii<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.310> if<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
like a 5d mark ii so if you have a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
like a 5d mark ii so if you have a
full-frame<00:00:30.330> camera<00:00:30.840> or<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.410> think<00:00:31.710> you're

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
architecture lens interior it's great
but<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.899> about<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but the one thing I really like about it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.819 
but the one thing I really like about it
is<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.340> fast<00:01:50.700> lens<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.360> 2.8<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is it is a very fast lens at 2.8 the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.270 
is it is a very fast lens at 2.8 the
focusing<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> very<00:01:54.689> quick<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.799> sharpness

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
focusing is very quick and the sharpness

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.999 
focusing is very quick and the sharpness
is<00:01:56.460> also<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.030> very<00:01:57.210> good<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.770> build

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
is also very very good the build

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
is also very very good the build
construction<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.700> very<00:01:59.909> nice<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.420> has<00:02:00.600> some

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
construction is very nice it has some

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
construction is very nice it has some
weather<00:02:01.590> proofing<00:02:02.009> has<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> weather<00:02:02.490> proofing

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
weather proofing has a weather proofing

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.399 
weather proofing has a weather proofing
seal<00:02:03.119> around<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.350> base<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.640> waterproof

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
seal around the base it's not waterproof

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
seal around the base it's not waterproof
but<00:02:07.429> for<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> most<00:02:08.670> part<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> keep

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but for the most part it's going to keep

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660 
but for the most part it's going to keep
most<00:02:09.750> dust<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.619> dirt<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.250> lens<00:02:11.459> if

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
most dust and dirt out of the lens if

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
most dust and dirt out of the lens if
you<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> weather<00:02:12.390> sealed<00:02:12.690> body

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you have a weather sealed body

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.550 
you have a weather sealed body
now<00:02:13.830> there<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.700> another<00:02:15.150> lens<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:16.140> performs

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
now there is another lens that performs

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.240 
now there is another lens that performs
even<00:02:16.800> better

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
even better

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.690 
even better
it's<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.730> 14<00:02:18.330> millimeter<00:02:18.769> 2.8<00:02:19.769> we're<00:02:20.459> taking

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
it's the 14 millimeter 2.8 we're taking

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's the 14 millimeter 2.8 we're taking
linear<00:02:20.819> lens<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.690> problem<00:02:22.019> with<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.170> lens

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
linear lens the problem with that lens

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.940 
linear lens the problem with that lens
is<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.310> really<00:02:24.000> expensive<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:24.660> almost

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
is it's really expensive it's almost

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.670 
is it's really expensive it's almost
$3,000<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.660> are<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> professional

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
$3,000 so if you are a professional

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.930 
$3,000 so if you are a professional
photographer<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.459> needs<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.790> good

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
photographer that needs a good

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.710 
photographer that needs a good
wide-angle<00:02:30.450> solution<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.160> probably

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
wide-angle solution this is probably

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.440 
wide-angle solution this is probably
more<00:02:33.720> cost-effective<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:35.299> there<00:02:36.299> is<00:02:36.420> that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
more cost-effective but there is that

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.390 
more cost-effective but there is that
one<00:02:36.660> better<00:02:37.110> lens<00:02:37.379> it's<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> zoom<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.280> is

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
one better lens it's not a zoom this is

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.559 
one better lens it's not a zoom this is
the<00:02:38.519> better<00:02:38.700> wide-angle<00:02:39.239> with<00:02:39.390> less

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
the better wide-angle with less

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.619 
the better wide-angle with less
Distortion<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.319> any<00:02:40.830> event<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.599> highly<00:02:42.599> highly

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
Distortion in any event I highly highly

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.110 
Distortion in any event I highly highly
recommend<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.319> 16<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.769> 35<00:02:44.129> if<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.610> have<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
recommend the 16 to 35 if you have the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.400 
recommend the 16 to 35 if you have the
money<00:02:45.269> for<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.569> because<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> great

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
money for it because it is a great

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
money for it because it is a great
all-purpose<00:02:47.299> wide-angle<00:02:48.299> lens<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.810> I'm

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
all-purpose wide-angle lens and I'm

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.330 
all-purpose wide-angle lens and I'm
Michael<00:02:49.410> Andrew<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.799> I'll<00:02:49.890> see<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.130> next
