00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to power this thing as before I almost

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679

stayed<00:00:28.980> away<00:00:29.189> from<00:00:29.369> those<00:00:29.519> things<00:00:29.820> don't<00:00:30.510> know

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
stayed away from those things don't know

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.290 
stayed away from those things don't know
why<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> works<00:00:31.349> great<00:00:31.880> I'll<00:00:32.880> stop<00:00:33.180> for

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
why but it works great I'll stop for

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.580 
why but it works great I'll stop for
some<00:00:33.480> reason<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.930> extra<00:00:34.350> sound

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
some reason there would be extra sound

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.990

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
daisy-chaining all the pedals together
and<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.870> always<00:00:37.050> believed<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> had<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.129> go

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
and I always believed that I had to go

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
and I always believed that I had to go
through<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> Furman<00:00:38.910> board<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> nice

through the Furman board to get a nice

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.139 
through the Furman board to get a nice
clean<00:00:40.440> sound<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.340> conditioned

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
clean sound because it was conditioned

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.860 
clean sound because it was conditioned
and<00:00:42.329> whatnot

options<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.450> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
options on it and so I really like that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.310 
options on it and so I really like that
pedal<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.740> kind<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.460> an<00:02:00.420> OCD<00:02:00.930> clone

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
pedal this is kind of a an OCD clone

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.150 
pedal this is kind of a an OCD clone
it's<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.409> custom<00:02:05.329> pedal<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.780> 100%<00:02:07.469> sure<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:08.009> just

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it's a custom pedal not 100% sure I just

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's a custom pedal not 100% sure I just
tried<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.789> loved<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
tried it out and loved it it's a it's a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.680 
tried it out and loved it it's a it's a
real<00:02:11.099> nice<00:02:11.280> pedal<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> kind<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.480> call<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
real nice pedal but I kind of call it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.920 
real nice pedal but I kind of call it
like<00:02:12.900> an<00:02:13.020> OCD<00:02:13.319> clone

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
like an OCD clone

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.390 
like an OCD clone
then<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.170> use<00:02:14.319> this<00:02:14.439> seymour<00:02:14.769> duncan<00:02:14.859> booster

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
then I use this seymour duncan booster

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.080 
then I use this seymour duncan booster
pedal<00:02:16.170> usually<00:02:17.170> use<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.530> really<00:02:18.459> low<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:19.000> to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
pedal usually use it really low just to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.080 
pedal usually use it really low just to
add<00:02:19.209> some<00:02:19.510> extra<00:02:20.939> volume<00:02:21.939> clean<00:02:22.870> boost<00:02:23.170> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
add some extra volume clean boost to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.929 
add some extra volume clean boost to
some<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.150> these<00:02:25.209> over<00:02:25.540> drives<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:27.670> I've<00:02:27.790> got

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
some of these over drives then I've got

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.910 
some of these over drives then I've got
it<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.239> into<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.780> Hall<00:02:29.049> of<00:02:29.079> Fame<00:02:29.230> reverb

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
it going into the Hall of Fame reverb

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.349 
it going into the Hall of Fame reverb
pedal<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.489> these<00:02:30.730> pedals<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.389> sometimes<00:02:31.719> go<00:02:33.359> to

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
pedal and these pedals I sometimes go to

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.699 
pedal and these pedals I sometimes go to
an<00:02:34.450> effects<00:02:34.750> loop<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.200> right<00:02:35.349> now<00:02:35.469> I'm<00:02:35.590> using

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
an effects loop but right now I'm using

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.259 
an effects loop but right now I'm using
a<00:02:35.950> bad<00:02:36.129> cat<00:02:36.400> amp<00:02:36.579> that<00:02:36.790> doesn't<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.150> an

a bad cat amp that doesn't have an
effects<00:02:37.569> loop<00:02:37.799> already<00:02:38.799> in<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.129> I'm<00:02:39.280> using<00:02:39.549> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
effects loop already in it I'm using the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.670 
effects loop already in it I'm using the
cub<00:02:39.909> 2r<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.900> doesn't<00:02:41.139> have<00:02:41.290> an<00:02:41.409> effects

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
cub 2r and it doesn't have an effects

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.879 
cub 2r and it doesn't have an effects
loop<00:02:41.769> currently<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.840> when<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> do<00:02:44.109> use<00:02:44.469> my<00:02:44.680> Ma's

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
loop currently but when I do use my Ma's

loop currently but when I do use my Ma's
18<00:02:45.250> junior<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.879> just<00:02:46.359> go<00:02:46.450> ahead<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.720> throw

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
18 junior I just go ahead and throw

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.159 
18 junior I just go ahead and throw
those<00:02:47.019> into<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.409> effects<00:02:47.680> loop<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.049> is

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
those into the effects loop so this is

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.080 
those into the effects loop so this is
the<00:02:50.260> hall-of-fame<00:02:50.470> reverb<00:02:51.250> some<00:02:51.939> of<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
the hall-of-fame reverb some of the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.559 
the hall-of-fame reverb some of the
settings<00:02:52.329> I<00:02:52.419> use<00:02:52.569> for<00:02:53.530> worship<00:02:53.950> are<00:02:54.159> I<00:02:54.569> usually

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
settings I use for worship are I usually

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.659 
settings I use for worship are I usually
always<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.169> room<00:02:57.269> reverb<00:02:58.269> on<00:02:59.669> and

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:00.669 
always have the room reverb on and

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.020 
always have the room reverb on and
sometimes<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.120> get<00:03:01.209> some<00:03:01.419> nice<00:03:02.639> organ<00:03:03.639> or<00:03:03.790> pad

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
sometimes to get some nice organ or pad

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.670 
sometimes to get some nice organ or pad
sounds<00:03:04.689> I<00:03:04.870> use<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.609> church<00:03:06.609> or<00:03:06.790> mod<00:03:07.030> settings

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
sounds I use the church or mod settings

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.289 
sounds I use the church or mod settings
and<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.739> think<00:03:08.950> those<00:03:09.069> are<00:03:09.219> kind<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.430> nice<00:03:09.609> and

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
and I think those are kind of nice and

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.159 
and I think those are kind of nice and
you<00:03:10.659> can<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:11.079> mess<00:03:11.620> around<00:03:11.769> with<00:03:12.040> these<00:03:13.169> pre

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
you can just mess around with these pre

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.199 
you can just mess around with these pre
delays<00:03:14.560> short<00:03:15.040> or<00:03:15.250> long<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.489> depending<00:03:16.150> on

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
delays short or long just depending on

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.939 
delays short or long just depending on
what<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.540> want<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.349> truly<00:03:17.560> does<00:03:17.739> make<00:03:17.919> a

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
what you want it just truly does make a

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.099 
what you want it just truly does make a
difference<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.549> I'll<00:03:19.150> turn<00:03:19.329> up<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.510> decay

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
difference and I'll turn up the decay

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.869 
difference and I'll turn up the decay
and<00:03:20.409> the<00:03:20.500> effects<00:03:20.739> level<00:03:21.129> or<00:03:21.220> whatnot<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.760> get

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
and the effects level or whatnot to get

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.210 
and the effects level or whatnot to get
some<00:03:22.060> nice<00:03:22.269> really<00:03:22.659> ambient<00:03:23.109> noises<00:03:23.290> then

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
some nice really ambient noises then

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.899 
some nice really ambient noises then
I've<00:03:24.340> got<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.760> DD<00:03:25.180> 20<00:03:25.479> pedal<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.530> one<00:03:26.909> is

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
I've got the DD 20 pedal this one is

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.259 
I've got the DD 20 pedal this one is
actually<00:03:28.180> kind<00:03:28.569> of<00:03:28.659> somewhat<00:03:29.019> noisy<00:03:29.909> it<00:03:30.909> gives

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
actually kind of somewhat noisy it gives

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.330 
actually kind of somewhat noisy it gives
us<00:03:31.479> nice<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:32.139> always<00:03:32.979> thought<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:33.220> was<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
us nice I always thought it was the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.030 
us nice I always thought it was the
patch<00:03:33.549> cables<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.120> was<00:03:34.209> using<00:03:34.389> I<00:03:35.040> don't

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
patch cables that I was using I don't

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.189 
patch cables that I was using I don't
use<00:03:36.189> always<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.579> best<00:03:36.970> patch<00:03:37.209> cables<00:03:37.720> but<00:03:37.959> I

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
use always the best patch cables but I

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.379 
use always the best patch cables but I
always<00:03:38.709> thought<00:03:38.979> it<00:03:39.099> was<00:03:39.220> those<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.090> test

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
always thought it was those and I test

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.080 
always thought it was those and I test
them<00:03:40.540> all<00:03:40.689> individually<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.849> really<00:03:42.849> none<00:03:43.060> of

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
them all individually and really none of

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.379 
them all individually and really none of
them<00:03:43.299> they're<00:03:43.870> all<00:03:43.900> very<00:03:44.199> quiet<00:03:45.239> until<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.269> hook

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
them they're all very quiet until I hook

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.689 
them they're all very quiet until I hook
up<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.659> CD<00:03:46.989> 20<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:48.009> I<00:03:48.040> just<00:03:48.189> got<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.370> lot<00:03:48.549> of

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
up the CD 20 and I just got a lot of

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.249 
up the CD 20 and I just got a lot of
either<00:03:48.819> popping<00:03:49.359> noises<00:03:49.599> you<00:03:49.989> know<00:03:50.109> it's

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:50.259 
either popping noises you know it's

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.879 
either popping noises you know it's
really<00:03:50.560> subtle<00:03:51.189> or<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:52.810> very<00:03:53.229> high-pitched

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
really subtle or a very high-pitched

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.670 
really subtle or a very high-pitched
whistling<00:03:54.280> noise<00:03:54.699> at<00:03:55.629> a<00:03:55.689> very<00:03:55.959> low<00:03:56.139> volume<00:03:56.319> but

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
whistling noise at a very low volume but

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.360 
whistling noise at a very low volume but
something<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.549> definitely<00:03:58.030> notice<00:03:59.370> when

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
something that I definitely notice when

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.319 
something that I definitely notice when
compared<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.000> all<00:04:01.419> these<00:04:01.689> other<00:04:01.750> pedals<00:04:03.329> not

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
compared to all these other pedals not

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.300 
compared to all these other pedals not
plugged<00:04:04.689> in<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.379> if<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.769> not<00:04:05.919> in<00:04:06.159> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
plugged in so if this is not in the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.429 
plugged in so if this is not in the
chain<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:07.060> doesn't<00:04:07.359> have<00:04:07.479> that<00:04:07.509> then<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.290> have

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
chain it doesn't have that then I have

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:13.949 
chain it doesn't have that then I have
the<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:11.079> little<00:04:11.439> tap<00:04:12.189> tempo<00:04:12.489> here<00:04:12.939> that<00:04:13.900> he

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
the this little tap tempo here that he

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.229 
the this little tap tempo here that he
used<00:04:14.199> to<00:04:14.379> tap<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:14.769> songs<00:04:15.040> on<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.370> fly<00:04:15.609> but

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
used to tap in songs on the fly but

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.379 
used to tap in songs on the fly but
that's<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.930> board<00:04:17.169> right<00:04:17.349> there<00:04:18.180> not<00:04:19.180> sure

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
that's the board right there not sure

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.729 
that's the board right there not sure
what<00:04:19.570> else<00:04:19.690> I'm<00:04:19.840> going<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.049> add<00:04:20.199> to<00:04:20.349> this<00:04:20.440> pedal

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
what else I'm going to add to this pedal

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.209 
what else I'm going to add to this pedal
board<00:04:20.949> but<00:04:21.190> it's<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.930> super<00:04:23.380> clean<00:04:23.620> compared

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:24.219 
board but it's just super clean compared

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:26.610 
board but it's just super clean compared
to<00:04:24.460> my<00:04:24.760> old<00:04:24.789> pedal<00:04:25.270> board<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.320> like<00:04:26.500> the

to my old pedal board and I like the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.140 
to my old pedal board and I like the
extra<00:04:26.950> space

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
extra space

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.749
