00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.820
 good companions my name is albert 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.149
 lÃ³pez I come to talk about the payola 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.980
 The payola is a very important method of 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.100
 investment that one makes in your product 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.880
 musical or video or artistic and so on 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.760
 any means 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.750
 why payola is important because 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.900
 that's being an investment investment 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.630
 that the producer the director or the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.820
 promoter they need because they do not 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.650
 It is convenient to place any song 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.250
 any video or any painting of 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.020
 an artist without results what concept 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.660
 they have many payola artists who 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.010
 they will not pay because they believe 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.860
 which is a silver that they are going to steal 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.500
 but it is not like that that silver serves to 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.690
 motivate the director to place his song 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.790
 because as I said earlier if not 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.590
 it does not motivate they are not going to have any 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.290
 result of that song to be able to 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.030
 place it an artist before thinking about 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.070
 your first production should think about the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.960
 payola to give more commitment to his 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.540
 work there are many artists who see this 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.189
 as something unethical but it's not like that 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.409
 movie should be seen as by a 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.329
 artist as something you need to 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.040
 promote your product because we are 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.990
 selling a product and if not the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.369
 we promote as we do to avoid 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.450
 have more economic results 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.369
 ahead 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.409
 you have to see it as a harvest as something 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.600
 that we are going to plant little by little and 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.850
 later we will collect all that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.100
 product today we are in a world 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.469
 updated technology in which 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.149
 We can make a product with 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.100
 very easy tools that we found 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.829
 in the house as is the example of doing 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.840
 a song with a usb microphone and a 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.100
 cellular as well as make a video 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.750
 musical with a cell phone camera 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.640
 among other examples that we can 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.890
 raise but that is not the idea here 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.899
 we are talking about the importance that 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.420
 has the payola and not the bad image that 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.670
 is given from this on the street this is a 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.530
 very common issue does not have to close the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.450
 her album is something that all are given 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.729
 the means that you see everywhere in the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.280
 world is a good investment that we should 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.500
 perform then the directors 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.119
 having both validate water can not not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.280
 be promoting any product 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.319
 because today any person 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.690
 does call artist this is where he arrives 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.549
 magic the word be sighted or 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.620
 indirectly in the economic was 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.269
 making a business or agreement in which 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.750
 you commit to collaborate in what 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.210
 needed and so your song 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.370
 will have one more vote of confidence to be 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.530
 promoted and you will see in this way that 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.900
 that talk did not get on the contrary 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.690
 is bearing fruit you can get 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.660
 more touches go to concerts have more 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.720
 contacts go to events that what you're going 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.670
 to need 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.950
 but do not think that only pay the majority 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.170
 you're going to hit not sir, it's not like that 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.380
 besides that you have to support yourself 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 among your family fans or friends to 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.150
 do a fieldwork in what 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.760
 consists of massifying your product or 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.860
 publish it on social networks 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.530
 in the cell phone states and in 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.140
 different means more so that for that 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.020
 more people have knowledge of this and 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.970
 can they ask for the numbers then 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.600
 we can conclude that the payola is 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.220
 project our product is to invest 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.360
 invest do not be reduced to these 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.890
 this is something very important we need 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.680
 promote our product to give it 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.850
 to know and find results 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.850
 economic later
