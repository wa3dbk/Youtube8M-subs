properties<00:01:17.009> we're<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.400> make<00:01:17.490> both<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
properties we're going to make both of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.130 
properties we're going to make both of
those<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.560> four<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.570> four<00:01:21.840> on

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
those to about four just put four on

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.780 
those to about four just put four on
each<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.659> make<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> little<00:01:24.930> tiny<00:01:25.080> square

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
each one and make a little tiny square

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.789 
each one and make a little tiny square
and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:26.880> we'll<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.150> into<00:01:27.330> our<00:01:27.750> nerves<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and then we'll go into our nerves and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.120 
and then we'll go into our nerves and
grab<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> sweep<00:01:29.369> NURBS<00:01:30.170> we'll<00:01:31.170> grab<00:01:31.439> our<00:01:31.590> text

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
grab a sweep NURBS we'll grab our text

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
grab a sweep NURBS we'll grab our text
and<00:01:32.340> make<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.150> child<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> sweep<00:01:33.990> NURBS

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and make that a child of the sweep NURBS

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.620 
and make that a child of the sweep NURBS
and<00:01:34.670> we'll<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> same<00:01:36.150> thing<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and we'll do the same thing with the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
and we'll do the same thing with the
rectangle<00:01:37.259> grab<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> make<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> child

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
rectangle grab that and make it a child

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
rectangle grab that and make it a child
of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> sweep<00:01:38.970> NURBS<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
of the sweep NURBS and as you can see it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.460 
of the sweep NURBS and as you can see it
made<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.400> outline<00:01:41.850> around<00:01:42.000> our<00:01:42.299> text<00:01:42.750> now

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
made the outline around our text now

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620 
made the outline around our text now
we'll<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.070> select<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.670> once

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
we'll go down here and select on once

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
we'll go down here and select on once
you<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:45.930> rectangle<00:01:46.380> selected<00:01:47.030> check

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you have your rectangle selected check

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.480 
you have your rectangle selected check
rounding<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.350> makes<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.649> little<00:01:49.740> smooth<00:01:50.280> edge

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
rounding it makes a little smooth edge

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.649 
rounding it makes a little smooth edge
around<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.000> hole<00:01:51.210> outside<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:53.420> okay<00:01:54.420> then

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.310 
with in radius make your height around
800<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.780> we'll<00:03:11.200> just<00:03:11.380> drag<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.650> up<00:03:12.090> into

800 and we'll just drag that up into
position<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:14.350> basically<00:03:15.100> curves<00:03:15.340> around<00:03:15.520> our

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910

and go back to your nerves grab another

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.010 
and go back to your nerves grab another
sweep<00:03:35.410> NURBS<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.850> as<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.120> did<00:03:37.270> before<00:03:37.300> grab

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
sweep NURBS and do as we did before grab

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.900

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
your helix make it a child of your sweep

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.780 
your helix make it a child of your sweep
NURBS<00:03:40.620> same<00:03:41.620> thing<00:03:41.830> with<00:03:41.980> your<00:03:42.100> circle<00:03:42.520> grab

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
NURBS same thing with your circle grab

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.460 
NURBS same thing with your circle grab
that<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.180> drag<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.600> up<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.930> your<00:03:44.050> sweep<00:03:44.290> NURBS

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that and drag it up to your sweep NURBS

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.190 
that and drag it up to your sweep NURBS
and<00:03:44.709> make<00:03:44.800> it<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.950> child<00:03:45.190> as<00:03:45.310> well<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:47.080> gives
