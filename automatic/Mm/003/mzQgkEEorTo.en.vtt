so now that we have the army composition
out<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.960> way<00:02:15.110> let's<00:02:15.320> head<00:02:15.650> into<00:02:15.800> how<00:02:16.010> to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
out of the way let's head into how to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.860 
out of the way let's head into how to
efficiently<00:02:16.520> train<00:02:17.030> your<00:02:17.180> troops<00:02:17.210> with<00:02:17.660> my

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
efficiently train your troops with my

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.960 
efficiently train your troops with my
composition<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.800> would<00:02:19.250> say<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.520> does<00:02:19.700> work<00:02:19.940> a

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
composition I would say it does work a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.120 
composition I would say it does work a
bit<00:02:20.270> better<00:02:20.540> with<00:02:20.810> level<00:02:21.140> 9<00:02:21.290> plus<00:02:21.650> barracks

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
bit better with level 9 plus barracks

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.680 
bit better with level 9 plus barracks
since<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.850> won't<00:02:23.000> need<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.150> continuously

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
since you won't need to continuously

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.420 
since you won't need to continuously
fill<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> barrack<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.800> also<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.280> a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
fill a barrack and also so that a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.740 
fill a barrack and also so that a
barrack<00:02:25.820> won't<00:02:26.030> take<00:02:26.210> longer<00:02:26.480> than<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
barrack won't take longer than the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.900 
barrack won't take longer than the
others<00:02:27.050> another<00:02:27.740> good<00:02:27.950> thing<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.160> do<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.640> once

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
others another good thing to do is once

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.880

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
what I would suggest would be to at

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.240 
what I would suggest would be to at
least<00:04:08.510> have<00:04:08.810> your<00:04:08.870> heroes<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.500> next<00:04:09.980> hero

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
ability say for example if your heroes

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.039 
ability say for example if your heroes
are<00:04:12.560> level<00:04:12.920> 1<00:04:13.070> take<00:04:13.430> them<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:13.579> level<00:04:13.880> 5<00:04:14.090> level<00:04:14.840> 5

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
are level 1 take them to level 5 level 5

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.770 
are level 1 take them to level 5 level 5
go<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.350> level<00:04:15.650> 10<00:04:15.860> 10<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.669> 15<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.359> take<00:04:17.510> full

go to level 10 10 to 15 and take full

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.420 
go to level 10 10 to 15 and take full
advantage<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:18.500> because<00:04:18.979> it's<00:04:19.250> basically

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
advantage of this because it's basically

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.460 
advantage of this because it's basically
a<00:04:19.669> free<00:04:19.940> ability<00:04:20.450> for<00:04:20.630> your<00:04:20.750> heroes<00:04:21.049> which

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
pushing and the next thing I would

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.170 
pushing and the next thing I would
recommend<00:04:24.680> would<00:04:25.190> be<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.520> have<00:04:25.729> your<00:04:25.910> heroes
