00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.420
 this is bluer black with lumen express 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.639
 they rich light tour with vd ferwerda and 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.620
 other members of the e-coaching 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.799
 I discuss here the specific 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.570
 problems are from this combination 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.520
 for that it is also necessary to finish her off 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.920
 far from her comfort zone to get the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.590
 for example through conscious tension 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.020
 moments or other unwanted situations 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.910
 to build in 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.880
 we make an analysis and then go 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 get started with customized exercises 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.780
 we think that is the only way 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 ensure that it is out of fitness 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
 has added value 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 because it makes no sense to everyone the same 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 exercise 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.730
 it can even backfire if you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.620
 this well and will pane 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.700
 really all levels and benefits 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.950
 to have 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.559
 and watch horses will with a lot 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.720
 more fun by the job we are going 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.520
 getting started with laura 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.090
 his guy so many critical looks 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.950
 exciting and you can see a little 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 her horse is a bit eager 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.799
 walk a little dauer 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.380
 it falls away under the outside shoulder 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.880
 we observe 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 the horse laurels a bit to the left 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.380
 Citizens are what matters 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 therefore she pinches something as compensation 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.780
 with the thighs too, she tightens her jaws 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 and neck a bit 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 very carefully analyzes him for that 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.840
 both more difficult exercises and things 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.570
 who are not going quite right to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.939
 laura her back and abs too much 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.700
 resistance rockes her upper body somewhat 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.290
 too much from the front to the back to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.420
 compensate 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.570
 they make a back hollow and nod her 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 help in with the inside rein 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.009
 she got a little tense outside 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.689
 while the right relaxed inside 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.939
 should come 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.090
 she moves a lot with her shoulders you 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.460
 sees that she is going to drive and that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.119
 always comes at the expense of the technical 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.520
 possibilities the cross of laurus pair 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.090
 compact much up it does not gallop 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.580
 more fluently by perpetrator, this is now one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.600
 under a double and therefore reasonable 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.600
 useless practice 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.620
 we are getting close now 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.620
 Laura's problem 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.370
 ferry tells laura that it kinks 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.140
 in her lower back to unlearn by 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.640
 to become aware of her 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.080
 abdominal muscles 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.690
 that she has to work on her 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.540
 corestability 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.850
 that only then they will notice all that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 violence is not necessary at all 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.570
 so you do n't have to compensate for anything 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.180
 to strain 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.320
 Laura strains her shoulders too much and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.320
 breathes too high 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
 we get laura and the horse from one 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.150
 do normal 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.960
 first time we use bars 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.330
 let laure 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.640
 do her feet off the braces for one 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.620
 independent 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 Laurels says they are now much nicer at it 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.020
 her horse is sitting because she has to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.840
 adjust for the last time over the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.630
 cabinet is the horse raises his neck 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.390
 length goes in balance and goes one again 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.390
 due to the jobs it is optimal at the lesson 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.270
 back on the ball working on this 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.370
 balance 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.200
 being aware of the operation of 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.820
 the abs 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.680
 laurels must be in the right way 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.750
 Tighten 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.860
 I think this is the best exercise for it 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.210
 detachment of the shoulders, neck, head 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.830
 that you use the 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.440
 gravity 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.510
 you let everything hang and you open your chest 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.330
 optimal 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.450
 we also pay attention to the abdominal breathing as 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.660
 you exhale you still know loosely about the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.660
 ball 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.170
 very does for how you get to it 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.050
 match in deep-set abdominal muscles 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.360
 that are the muscles that contract 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.610
 by making sure you get it 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.110
 don't talk 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.510
 Laurels here must pretend to be one 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.580
 string on her head, she should 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.520
 rely on who I always hear you say 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.370
 head up and your heart forward 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.430
 Laurels is forced to her ear 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.620
 aligning shoulder and hip 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.170
 balance control remains during the light 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.180
 drive twice 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.280
 in this exercise of a riders often 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.080
 in the back of the saddle 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.010
 Here you can see a nice balance 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.310
 to build 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.100
 gerry says send your hips from you 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.770
 belly blue response they laughed a lot 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.470
 the shoulders and fabiana helps her here 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.680
 to correct hatched and not 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.770
 by tensing legs or shoulders 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.200
 laura is now nice and loose so that every day 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.600
 already 12 horses and before it was up to it 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.090
 tired to the end of the day 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.310
 now she even has energy on it 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.140
 jury members step out and sometimes especially from the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.600
 car to tell how we parents 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.260
 drive and the last period is 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.260
 improved
