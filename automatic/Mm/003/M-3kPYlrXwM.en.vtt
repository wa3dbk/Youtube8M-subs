00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
makes sense that the jump button is in a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
makes sense that the jump button is in a
more<00:00:39.480> convenient<00:00:39.840> place<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:40.620> hand<00:00:40.920> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
battlefield the build that I played on a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
battlefield the build that I played on a
couple<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.710> months<00:02:04.829> ago<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.369> 7v7<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
couple of months ago was 7v7 and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.270 
couple of months ago was 7v7 and
honestly<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.380> action<00:02:07.829> packed<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280

on<00:02:11.069> each<00:02:11.250> site<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.629> do

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
on each site is really going to do

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770 
on each site is really going to do
Reese<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.770> action<00:02:14.130> by<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.730> much<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.630> other
