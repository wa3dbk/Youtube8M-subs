00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.090
 the people who work professionally at motorcity can still be found today at the 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.349
 police the roadside assistance and courier services 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.639
 but less honorable professional groups also use motorcycles 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.599
 this engine is equipped with a license plate on the customer of sir 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.689
 chirac 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.409
 France 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.119
 the driver is a so-called drug run 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.409
 someone who shows potential buyers the way to drug dealers 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.140
 the rotterdam police know the trees because of their occasional lives 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.620
 dangerous handling 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.370
 a little later in the evening via the mobile phone 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.740
 that it is wrong again with our friend 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.960
 he holds out the most stupid antics to escape the police and he 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.750
 is coming our way 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 hear it 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.810
 they lie 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.010
 no, it is not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 we can just dodge at a good time 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 la s 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.300
 hey our can run to a dubious honor to turn into the chase 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.650
 put 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.560
 apple 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.810
 because the driver may be under the influence of some drug 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.880
 means 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300
 I have to be careful 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.710
 for himself 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 the bystanders and the chasing police people 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 and deaf to shake off the police 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.070
 the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.070
 I just stand there in jail for you 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.700
 and there was indeed solution will be best 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.000
 it just goes by a car that suddenly changes direction 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.540
 despite the breakneck speed of the motorcyclist our camera car can be a 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 reasonable 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.689
 carefully we drive onto the tram track 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.719
 and just as suddenly as I started, the chase has ended 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.359
 but a short time later the motorcyclist was stopped 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.439
 and a policeman prepares the motorbike to the desk
