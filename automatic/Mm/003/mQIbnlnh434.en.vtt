00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 a minute review welcome to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.380
 preview my little review format in 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.950
 which only one rule gives the text is allowed 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.560
 no longer than one page of mine 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.869
 moment 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.010
 no no for an innovative review 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.010
 concept I'm too uncreative 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.359
 at a time in the vampire anymore 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 regarded as mystical and dark beings 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 but be nice and extreme 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.360
 Emotionally sensitive people are themselves 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.760
 fall in love and start a family 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.350
 want or the classic on trees 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.840
 climb and glitter in the sun 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.180
 I want you the forgotten mystic 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.879
 and that under dark again a little bit 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.649
 bring closer well ok actually wanted 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.719
 I only bring you closer to castlevania 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.820
 and what exactly it has to do with vampires 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.949
 the castlevania stranger asks himself now 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.600
 Well, almost every kassel if you 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 game is the end boss dracula 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 personally that my friends 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.369
 a real vampire not that here 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.560
 no that here and in this video would like 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.049
 I'm looking at exactly one part of this big one 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.590
 come in series symphony of the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.049
 night 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.210
 the game was released in 1997 for the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.159
 playstation 1 and sega saturn and was 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.960
 also the kastell if you what as 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.509
 first from typical level to level 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.729
 Gameplay distanced and the series in 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.610
 steer in a slightly different direction 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.990
 a good direction yes i know it came before 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 still say minsk west with one 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.409
 similar playing style but in symphony of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.220
 the night where that just a lot better 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.470
 implemented 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.420
 a little corner became a platform 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.700
 big sidescroller adventure with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280
 roleplaying elements I am titled 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.939
 also like the match only in close combat 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.950
 game 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.750
 There is even a section of fans 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.570
 was invented for such a game 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.200
 she calls herself nice if yes or too 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.200
 box 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.330
 in simple the one on the envy you control 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.490
 the white-haired hero alu card through 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.890
 a huge castle that every 100 years 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.960
 appears and as the dwelling of the dark 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.759
 Prince Dracula serves again and again 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 to start a war with humanity 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.420
 And that's exactly what our hero รก la carte wants 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.220
 prevent 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.650
 everything else now to the story 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.050
 betrayed could not be spoiler free 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.880
 and since lords of shadow became lukas 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.470
 history completely rewritten anyway 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.069
 That's why I will not do anything else 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.610
 betray 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:29.560
 in the end, everything reads dracula 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.560
 now it's out now everyone knows 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.890
 Of course you are not alone in the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.870
 closed because it is 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.220
 different opponents the first rule 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.630
 Of course there are lures that has 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.040
 live something hard to make 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.900
 but at the same time they are also the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.280
 source of points of experience 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.080
 needed to go to the next level 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.390
 to be able to ascend and also one 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.910
 source for armor money and other items 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.590
 that in turn means next to the equipment 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.660
 which the opponents drop and find 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.680
 many uncommon in innumerable secret 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.840
 weapons and armor 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.970
 Well and if you are not lucky with the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.130
 has opponents and also through the eyes for 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.570
 secrets, there is also an old one 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.850
 man in the library another 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.859
 equipment sold thus stands one 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.329
 a large selection of items you get on 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.430
 different ways with each other 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.579
 can combine so its own 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.370
 playing style does not find that this 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.299
 enough would be enough for his character 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.459
 There is still the individualize 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.049
 castlevania typical throw items the 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.510
 are in the candles 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.820
 yes in the candles I never understood 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.130
 why in all castlevania play 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.019
 Items to find money in the candles 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.569
 neither do I understand why in 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.930
 hiding some chicken roast chicken 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.120
 are 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.380
 Well, I believe that is one of the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.660
 points I always think of 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.209
 should stop over the logic of a 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.130
 thinking about video games 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.660
 but back to the topic further 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.209
 mastered alu card different 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.889
 spells and a small selection 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.720
 accompany them either with hall 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.549
 sayings and babs support or 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.090
 even a fight as a partner with 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.099
 fight 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.989
 Also in the castle are many powerups 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.360
 Hidden like for example the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.610
 bat shape 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.250
 the gravitation shoes or the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.360
 double jump the power-ups bring one 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.370
 point a to play 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.080
 who tells me that I also understand 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.510
 that this game is not for 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.850
 everyone is this point I mean 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.650
 It's called backtracking even if it's a few 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.690
 Teleportation points are there 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.470
 nevertheless very many courses several times 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.540
 run through 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.130
 So like in the backtracking do not like 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.620
 This game will not necessarily be 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.720
 fallen and the game is very strong 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.100
 on backtracking on the one no 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.380
 predetermined ways in this game 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.480
 you almost always run into one 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.820
 enter into it by going to the 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.400
 boss opponent comes but several small 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.660
 reach branches or secret first 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.580
 if you can, for example, the ability 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.210
 owns a bat too 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.700
 transform 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.110
 that is, you take another away 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.880
 and once you form the bat 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.230
 you get back and go back 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.030
 look around the branches 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.830
 This is not only rare 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.310
 items or reaches a few extra 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.830
 level 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.680
 no, there is also an alternative 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.000
 special questreihe not necessarily 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.770
 obviously, mine is mine 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.780
 most respectful to developers should 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.380
 that she dared to do anything like that 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.210
 to have 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.250
 because if you have this alternative 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.070
 questreihen not finished and directly to 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.030
 Endboss works then you only have half 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.800
 played game 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.050
 Actually, the story is still going on 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.669
 some further and there is a lot 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.979
 would be boring if you go through again 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.350
 the same lock would have to run 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.110
 closed once completely by 180 degrees 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.960
 turned now you think but children 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.760
 it is always the same circuit so as 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.350
 you are right but the feeling that 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.330
 you get when you actually already 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.220
 the whole lock has learned by heart 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.200
 and now completely the other way around must think 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.850
 it just awesome 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.620
 and of course it's not just one 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.650
 Closed on the head of course there is 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.610
 now new stronger opponents new items and 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.250
 new bosses versatility the size 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.010
 the freedom the ingenious posts for the 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.229
 coherent music and the incredibly good 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.600
 Metroid less gameplay is one 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.910
 milestone of the castlevania series like 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.320
 also in the metroid but if you are 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.090
 I actually tell everyone that 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.930
 this video knows knows and loves 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:12.789
 this wonderful game where do you have the 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.889
 spent last 20 years of life 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:20.289
 about on kastl 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:25.150
 wayne I really have that right now 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:28.090
 I just said what could I have done 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.219
 just a bad joke I bring 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.650
 can not continue like this is this 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:34.650
 it's over
