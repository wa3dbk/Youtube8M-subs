00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.120
 good everyone from two to one lived good 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.309
 it seems that good rumors are running 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.940
 pretty good at what revolves around 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.769
 a grand theft auto 5 for pc or the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.450
 first of them is something quite like 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.120
 say it pretty obvious at least 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.220
 I hope it's because being that way because 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.100
 I play running at 30 frames ez 5 lo 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.210
 I started running 30 frames in my pc 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.100
 the eggs fall I hope they do not put 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.320
 no blockage or anything like that 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.810
 as they have done another game if they say that 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.750
 what would already be running at 60 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.150
 frames per second in the title without 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.640
 no problem and without many 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.140
 so optimization requirements tell us 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 how good the optimization bought some 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.700
 grand theft auto 4 that nothing has to 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.920
 see absolutely nothing and that people do not 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.200
 worry basically well also 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.990
 they say the same wrong apt max 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.110
 payne 3 for pc 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.960
 is adapting this very big pc 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.250
 photo 5 and well that's pretty enough 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.170
 Well the truth is that it's something 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.120
 good to listen to me because according to state 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.750
 reading further I'm not reporting on 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.640
 all calm and easy max payne 3 is 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.280
 very well optimized I started with which 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.040
 Well, I've made the best conversions 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.500
 in fact since that time so good 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.720
 really, you have to be alarmed, though 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.340
 the thanks in this regard 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.850
 and good nothing but me the truth while 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.940
 the game runs 60 pesos or 860 fish 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.010
 to 60 frames and other happy long I in 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.990
 the power to capture the game roasts that 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.660
 quality way that I like so much 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.450
 in that sense that logically games 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.770
 they are going to play 30 and not others but 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.440
 it really is always a little more 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.410
 nice to put them to 60 at least in 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.350
 my opinion to 60 or the computer that 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.510
 have the fps that you run the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.850
 game and so on you know that depends 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.880
 from your computer or company 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.560
 if you decide to block them at a rate of 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.180
 frames and others 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.159
 so good but good I think that a 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.640
 from 60 is when you notice the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.780
 difference in what else to say as that the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.789
 game will be very well optimized 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.020
 according to are saying internal sources and 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.209
 others because he's going to do it himself 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.920
 team that is doing it the same 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.959
 team that did it that did it with max 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.330
 payne 3 and others not nothing else there are 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.650
 to wait simply on January 27 and 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.880
 see to see what is happening 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.800
 suppose we have new details 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.720
 soon we will surely even have 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.300
 the odd trailer soon in these 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 Christmas is very very very likely that 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.920
 before the end of this month we have 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.350
 something because there are many probabilities very 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.700
 high so nothing will keep waiting 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.769
 and there are also many possibilities of 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.120
 that robberies are coming this month 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.560
 hundred because if the robberies do not arrive , 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.170
 I drop the eggs or I no longer 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.090
 I understand to register with your delays or 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.099
 be and I imagine that really some 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.630
 Christmas day update will be 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.920
 that dinner 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.720
 will be the robberies I do not know so good 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.400
 nothing more guys this has been everything and nothing 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.670
 see you in the next video until the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.670
 next
