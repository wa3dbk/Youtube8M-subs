00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.109
 pizza will replace that dash well 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.090
 characteristic of disney and today I come 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.850
 bring curiosity about the movie the beautiful 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.060
 asleep which was the sixteenth film 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.980

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.649

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.030
 That's it but it's been a while since I came

 I hope you like it, come on. 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.550
 the film premiered on January 29, 1959 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.260
 the classic was filmed and a quality 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.060
 70mm which was much higher than 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.750
 time it was just a few movies that had 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.750
 that quality 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.060
 was the last disney movie that was 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.430
 hand painted after the process came 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.150
 in geography and all others used 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.150
 this technique 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.490
 was the last film of fairy tale of the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.260
 I audition for him in 1966 and he calls himself 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.440
 of ox on last night almost all 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.690
 believe that zero hunger comes from 81 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.180
 middle east countries including jewelry 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.960
 disney studios will only do it again. 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.070
 films based on fairy tales in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.070
 1989 with the premiere of the little mermaid 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.730
 the film was named Sleeping Beauty 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.730
 that neither the super famous Russian ballet 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.629
 all the songs in the movie are arrangements 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.670
 or adaptations of Russian ballet and were 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.819
 played by the symphony orchestra of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.819
 Berlin 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.090
 the original script was adapted from the short story 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.260
 of charles perrault who was inspired by 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.260
 a tale of the grimm brothers 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.310
 sleeping was the first film based 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:19.440
 in a fairy tale they say they had a 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:21.720
 with the name called 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.910
 tall and slender silhouette of the princess 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.380
 aurora was inspired by the physiognomy of 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.380
 actress audrey rabbani 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.580
 O 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.670
 initially the fairies flora fauna and 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.560
 spring is a super equal and almost no 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.030
 I could recognize another one 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.770
 then they decided that they had 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.320
 that look and personality 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.470
 and we will agree that it was a 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.230
 great choice alive on the globe 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.730
 each scenario took seven to ten days 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.590
 to get ready 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.720
 some ideas used in the movie the beautiful 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.980
 were original ideas of the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.100
 snow white movie and the seven dwarfs 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.810
 1937 under those ideas is a very 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.670
 advanced for the technology they 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:26.630
 They call the 30's so they're done. 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:29.270

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.280
 2014 admitted also released the film takes 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.350
 who has angelina jolie as the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.050
 protagonist and tells a version 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.900
 different from the story of the sleeping beauty 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.900
 which is a version of villain the malevolent 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.770
