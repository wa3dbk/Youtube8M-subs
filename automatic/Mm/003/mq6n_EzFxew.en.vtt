00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
 information that all this is in

 description which parenthesis of this 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.020
 video there and we'll start with the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.520
 information a lot of the ex boxer who 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.320
 is actually right now really 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.820
 really belittled and then I still 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 information for you at the level of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.079
 the release date or here at a level 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.280
 big negative again so that's right 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.629
 that right now and that you will see 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.289
 tomorrow since I will also be coming out 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.000
 other video 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.140
 and coincidence in addition to that it's 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.309
 almost connect so that's 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.969
 new information that I could 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.680
 get 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.330
 and then normally he will also have tomorrow 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.890
 new another video actually to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.950
 about a kind of comparison between 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.840
 the xbox wii and the playstation 4 at 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.860
 level of the type of record you 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 will see tomorrow any case I will you 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.830
 advise to have it because you 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 I think I'm pretty sure 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.860
 you do not know at the pot of his service 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.630
 training from elsewhere who are 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 officially over to information 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.650
 who do not we are going to say that they did not 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.820
 not really been launched ie 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.040
 here you may not have 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.540
 necessarily had to hear about it then 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.100
 so we will start with 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.869
 information here about the xbox one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 about the release date we have 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 some small ideas since we could 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.000
 see the release date of the game call 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.799
 of duty ghost and Thursday call of duty 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 ghost is good but it is tell me what 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.189
 the fuck not just that on the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.350
 call of duty call record that I'm going 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.509
 show you well we can actually see 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.119
 five points 11 points 13 ie the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.560
 September 5, 2013 will be the kind date of 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.659
 release of the game call of duty gossement 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 can also on the picture puts there is everything 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.799
 just the game beats 2 which will be 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.049
 available simply on the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.710
 Consonates the xbox windows platform at 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.240
 microsoft 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.300
 after that it will be available on 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.040
 playstation 4 normally yes 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.420
 but in any case it will be available on 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.130
 this console has so what does it mean 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.780
 that it is simply that we know of 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.120
 anyway and that microsoft it says that 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.070
 the game released at the console and witness 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.750
 will come out in September world knows 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.660
 not when and when we look so 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.400
 apparently on September 5, 2013 there will be 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.960
 the release date of the call of duty game 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.420
 costil but we can simply say that 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.000
 the release date of the game finally from a 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.940
 concept rather the xbox one so by 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.740
 microsoft will release baala the same opportunity 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.630
 in fact the output of the game call of 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.950
 duty go east his sequel quite 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.720
 possible by the way he could go out to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.980
 sell one or two days but I think 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.600
 not actually who I think 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.220
 you clearly that the the column the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.840
 call of duty series 6 times this is a very 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.340
 very big series if you want and I 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.280
 think they will come out at the same time in 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.050
 does that lower than those its release date 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.600
 and so it's true that it can give 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.520
 something so normally there we 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.050
 can confirm all that same xbox one 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.820
 should go out anyway 5 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.610
 September 2013 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.920
 or he can go out before any case 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.210
 it will be taken at the beginning of the month to 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.370
 early September promised the 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.200
 mouse can roll back the date if one 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.520
 says armand sweet singing if you want 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.110
 you also talk to you about something 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.310
 others we there I gave you 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.680
 little information we see the date 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.959
 of exit so it will be early in the beginning 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.060
 of months we will say from September to after 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.380
 will it be the 5th as the date of 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.850
 left call of duty exit so his 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.620
 room to these questions I think they 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.820
 will come out at the same time tell me what 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.020
 I thought about it in the passage of one of 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.950
 all while holding the comment bar 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.000
 and I never say want to you 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.280
 talk about something else 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.750
 at the level of the subscription system gold 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.330
 so for all the people who are on 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.640
 xbox 360 you have you have this little 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.980
 xbox live gold stuff or something like that 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.390
 I 'm not on xbox I do not know 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.790
 not too much but you must pay in any case 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.459
 the xbox live and of course the xbox one 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.190
 there will be a lot of low councilors from 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.920
 pay we'll say the live since everything 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.050
 just well he'll allow in 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.870
 more of that to do things since 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.040
 your console I explain myself a little more 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.510
 your kinect also to a small 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.860
 functionality ie both 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.170
 plays talk tomorrow when 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.480
 ask your kinect to record and 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.519
 well it will save the screen the worry 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.090
 is that this option is only 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.099
 available if you have 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.810
 subscription system gold ie 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.829
 that you can record gameplay 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.449
 that and I'm saying that if you have not 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.549
 this subscription system option 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.810
 gold so I tell them so this is a 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.919
 important thing there are also other 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.590
 little things there for now do not 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.910
 was not too much other things that 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.650
 actually requires you to have this system 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.660
 subscription there will be a system apart 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.669
 between two multiplayer modes since the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.150
 menu something like that or whatever 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.530
 in short, there are things that go that go 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.330
 ask for the gold subscription and I find 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.639
 it's really abusive because it's okay 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.950
 ask again to pay more for 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.200
 finally down get that console 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.030
 to basic and I find that really 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.639
 really got from them after me it's 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.320
 my opinion but when we look at sony who 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.240
 do it for free and then we see 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.160
 microsoft who continues to ask for 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.050
 money and forces them the system 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.010
 gold subscription for not one for 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.410
 record gameplay 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.020
 I find it really really really 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.250
 abusive honestly I think it's up to 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.320
 just about everything for today 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.669
 what I really want to tell you 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.930
 it's just frankly 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.120
 watch the video tomorrow as hours 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.940
 a very very good comparison between the 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.740
 xbox wii and the playstation 4 about the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.240
 registration system conferring its 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.770
 all tomorrow will explain to you and 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.030
 frankly it's really worth it 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.320
 Here thank you to tell me in a 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.669
 processor and a comment bar 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.990

 600 orders placed at 7 6 700 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.360
 comments on my special video 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.410
 forty thousand subscribers it's not that 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.970
 once the people who wrote 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.169
 the story almost as positive as I 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.139
 had to see one or two bad comments 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.450
 wait for it yeah it's low or at 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.460
 99% or 99% 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.380
 but how does a father that's the luis 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.880
 really a shock has the passage really to 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.650
 lecce that this chain although I have 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.289
 created at least see pretty much if I have 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.490
 make a video presentation at least 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.240
 go see that to see a little near this 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.700
 what do you think 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.810
 so basically I'll get out of it will not be 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.820
 immediately there will be another video 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.229
 presentation on this channel there for 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.270
 pretty much you get yourself a little 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.740
 less endures on this chain so has it 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.690
 good after you'll see all this here it's 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.880
 just a two presentations here's the 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.950
 chain and create all that and then that's it 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.420
 So it's all in the description 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.650
 the first link could also kill my 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.300
 page 16 or you can do what you 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.430
 want and then I tell you with
