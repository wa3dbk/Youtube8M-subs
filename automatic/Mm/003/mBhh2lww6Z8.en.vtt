heard I've done some research on the
internet<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.140> I've<00:00:19.230> heard<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.800> canned

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
internet and I've heard that canned

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
internet and I've heard that canned
chicken<00:00:21.680> works<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.949> best<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> that's<00:00:24.480> what

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
chicken works the best so that's what

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.750 
chicken works the best so that's what
we're<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> use<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.710> think<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.460> because

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
we're going to use I think it's because

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.080 
we're going to use I think it's because
it's<00:00:26.970> been<00:00:27.150> canned<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.199> its<00:00:28.349> own<00:00:28.529> broth

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
it's been canned in its own broth

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.179 
it's been canned in its own broth
maybe<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> reason<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.500> right<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.890> let's<00:00:32.070> get

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
maybe the reason all right so let's get

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
maybe the reason all right so let's get
started<00:00:32.790> okay<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.840> things<00:00:34.170> first<00:00:34.260> I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
reason is its weight its glass and it's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.580 
reason is its weight its glass and it's
liquids<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.910> I'm<00:02:32.720> pretty<00:02:33.080> sure<00:02:33.290> I'd<00:02:33.410> never
