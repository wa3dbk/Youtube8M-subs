00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.880
 welcome i am king slim frames for 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.000
 draw good dot hello 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.650
 what to do in this video you will see the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 application of lessons learned 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 in the four previous videos of your 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.720
 first steps in photoshop called in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.090
 the youtube channel draw with photoshop 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.060
 in five minutes with which you will learn 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.329
 from scratch to draw with the program 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.329
 adobe 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.820
 Now you can see the normal process that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.580
 I continue with some of my drawings in this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.830
 I wanted to redesign the helmet of the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.960
 master jean or master gym of the game 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.440
 league of legends known also as 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.440
 LOL 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.170
 once I have the sketch that to me 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.260
 like under the opacity of that layer and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.540
 created a new one over and there I proceed to 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.090
 review and correct the drawing to 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.340
 leave it as I like it in this case 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.250
 I used the brush that you can 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.229
 download in the post your first 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.229
 Photoshop steps like mixing colors 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.990
 drawing is an organic process so 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.720
 the pattern is mutating, changing from 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 the origin to the end and it's changing 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.310
 some parts of your designs 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.060
 when I'm already satisfied with the line 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.060
 we turn to color 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.670
 this time I have tried the drawing 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.560
 as if it were a scan I have 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.200
 collapsed with a white background so that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.540
 see how applying to that layer a way 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 of fusion multiply the white background or 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.390
 disappears and I can work 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.390
 perfectly with her 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.020
 then happened to color normally would go 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.390
 plugging the line with the color up 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.940
 treat it as if it were a painting at 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.970
 oil or an acrylic but in this case 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.310
 for the example I will use a line up to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.310
 final as if it were a comic type drawing 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.849
 remember to put the layer in mode 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.420
 multiply if not the fund will not be made 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.420
 transparent 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.930
 well now I want you to review the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.190
 basic concepts that you have to remember from 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.190
 the previous videos 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.269
 have in the photoshop interface the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.110
 windows browser history and especially 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.110
 the window layers 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.140
 use keyboard shortcuts to navigate 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.470
 above the image the space bar 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.890
 to move and control + bar 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.070
 space for zoom to remember 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.620
 all these essential shortcuts and 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.280
 some more visit in drawing well 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.010
 puntocom the entrance the 23 shortcuts of the day 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.190
 vinci 2.0 there you have all the information 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.550
 you need about keyboard shortcuts 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.550
 to draw 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.530
 constantly use the brush and rubber 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.260
 to erase with the selected brush 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.470
 press alt to select different 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.730
 colors that you have in the palette or in the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.760
 rest of the drawing 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.980
 and alt + right button and dragging the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.739
 stylus from left to right or from 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.200
 up to down to change the size and 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.450
 the hardness or opacity of the cursor 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.700
 remember that keyboard shortcut is 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.730
 shared for the brush and the rubber 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.730
 delete 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.670
 notice that during the video to 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.260
 get some metallic glitters what 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.240
 What I have done is select the brush 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.300
 airbrush with noise that you can 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.640
 download on my website and make a pass 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.090
 global for the metal part in question 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.950
 and then delete with the same type of 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.040
 brush to simulate the brightness 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.040
 metallic 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.740
 plays with the opacity continuously in 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.650
 the brush to get some good 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.930
 transitions in addition to using the brushes 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.700
 airbrush type that you can download 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.440
 in the post your first steps in 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.950
 photoshop tools brush and rubber 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.260
 delete there I left a link for you 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.170
 download an airbrush with noise that goes 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.920
 great is the one that I used in 80% 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.920
 of this drawing 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.740
 manufactures tea in a separate layer a palette 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.730
 with the basic colors that you will use and make 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.380
 your mixes and so you will save time and 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.380
 you will work as it is traditionally done 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.770
 see collapsing the layers as you 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.080
 work using the brush without 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.180
 worry about the edges or other erase 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.360
 what's left of the pigment and once 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.180
 satisfied collapsed so you will avoid a 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.010
 amount of absurd layers and 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.250
 disorganized that in the end will not do more 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.580
 that bother creates a new layer and follows 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.530
 working there when you're satisfied 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:45.400
 it collapses again and so the 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.260
 process again and again and do not forget to go 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.510
 saving your work every so often 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.510
 to avoid unpleasant surprises 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.400
 you already have all the basic tools 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.670
 and you've seen how I do it I repeat this 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.520
 process over and over again until you master it and 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.230
 Once controlled, adapt it to your 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.060
 way to work and do your thing 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.060
 add your personal touch 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:33.819
 if you observe constantly I use the 

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:37.719
 same process in a pinto layer 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:40.719
 indiscriminately and erased with a rubber band 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.729
 of hard edge or with an edge 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:46.149
 softened the airbrush with noise by 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:47.979
 example what interests me and so one and 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:50.949
 again I'm collapsing and I 'm going 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:55.520
 building little by little the colors and 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:58.819
 the lights of the drawing in question 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.789
 the brightness and the trimming lights will be 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:04.909
 the last detail for our drawing a 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:08.090
 little smoke or background will help integrate 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:12.310
 image and give a little more 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.310
 realistic feeling 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.910
 Now comes the good I have prepared a 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:27.480
 exercise so that you can yourself 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.040
 color this same drawing download it in 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.200
 the entrance your first steps in 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.200
 photoshop practical application in 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.020
 www.dipujaen.es starts working 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.330
 you have finished the introduction cycle 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.330
 to the drawing with photoshop following these 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.500
 tips and hard work you can get 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.500
 wherever you want 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.620
 thanks for drawing well or what
