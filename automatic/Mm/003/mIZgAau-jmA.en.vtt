00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.330
 and that 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.330
 let's talk about crepes the crepes 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.490
 they have traces in the books and that 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.380
 they tell us that seven thousand years before 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.360
 Christ they began to eat these 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.849
 flat tortillas made with flour and 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.219
 water only with flour and water in 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.410
 more current times centuries before 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:30.079
 they started to mix with another kind of 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.930
 ingredients what is the flour that is the 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.690
 base before it was flour from other grains 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.000
 as not only wheat and it was wheat 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.770
 integral was not so refined when 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.730
 the industrial revolution begins when 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.410
 start let's say the wealthy families 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.910
 consume the white flours that the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.610
 reality is not the most nutritious but if 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.190
 is the richest thing then they started to 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.399
 Mix it with melted butter with 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.399
 milk with egg and one more dough was left 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.190
 enriched very tasty and that the 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.770
 reality gave them more consistency not 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.630
 it was so brittle to be more flexible 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.520
 They realized they could fill and 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.710
 they could fold it, I brought some 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 booklet here for you to see 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.740
 why have several ways crepas 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.740
 to bend 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.340
 let's think about fan I have my 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.409
 Round tortilla folded it in half and 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.180
 I have a half moon left and then the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.710
 I fold it again in half and I have one more 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.320
 triangle we call that also 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.270
 Fan triangle you can serve 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.920
 351 maybe two but they're better as 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.380
 the odd numbers that the pairs in 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.930
 cook and they will be very tasty 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.409
 your crepes now before moving on to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.430
 masses in the market and by saying market 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.009
 I mean the department stores 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.770
 to stores that sell items of 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.950
 kitchen to gourmet stores can 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.420
 find different containers 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.819
 pans and so on to make crepes one 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 very good would be a Teflon pan with 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.500
 the vertices rounded because we 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.230
 allows you to flip it more easily 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.820
 there are others like this that you are 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.160
 seeing here that I am moving if I 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.160
 you are seeing on the internet that they are very 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.580
 very flat planes there are different 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.150
 sizes are like comals with with say 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.470
 with a wall and these allow us because 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.360
 There are four or five different sizes 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.010
 you diamantes inicial 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.630
 departmentally good I bought it ago 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.870
 many years but huh 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.850
 and that's the the hit is to use it 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.380
 only for crepes nothing that for 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.680
 make little eggs nothing to use it as 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.330
 comal nothing that to make a stew 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 only crepes because because I no longer 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.040
 I'm going to wash again I wash it when I 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.790
 I buy it and then only what 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.739
 clean and put it in a clean cell 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.570
 and I have it saved first so that 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.790
 it scratches second so it does not get contaminated 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.580
 before using it, I'll pass it again 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.470
 very clean cloth and then a napkin 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.989
 with butter or with oil spray 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.959
 or with oil what you want to 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.140
 use it I heat it and then already open my 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.570
 crepe mix there are others that in the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.400
 old were used a lot that are these 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.750
 that are heavy 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.909
 there are French there are Europeans in other 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.709
 parts of the world and also made in 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.049
 USA and even in Mexico because in Mexico 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.329
 we are very ready to work the iron 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.939
 cast forged as you want it uneven 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.489
 these people realize that this is a 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.319
 dish we have a dish with dough what 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.019
 we put to the fire and since it is well 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.549
 hot almost red- hot we do this 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.849
 and we turn this curved or concave part 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.700
 so that it is filled with dough we drain a 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.849
 little we turned over the fire and almost 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.459
 in what respite is already you believe me for 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.889
 perfectly ready I'm going to take it with 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.639
 Beware of plastic wood stick 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.379
 etcetera or else I flip it with if I'm not 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.099
 if I'm brave for the good warm 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.560
 Well, I flipped it over and left it with a blow 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.760
 heat and I always retire of course 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.790
 keeping this cazuelita practice in 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.250
 the fire and having a deep dish but 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.010
 wide with the dough to be able to be 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.090
 taking mass there are other believe pears that 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.459
 are he 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.460
 that also has been more or less what 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.380
 same as this with a plate you 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.720
 you connect far from having it on fire 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.000
 you simply connect it you do this 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.060
 also turns on the mass trickles 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.889
 it's a little bit and in two kicks or what 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.889
 tell you your recipe book of the brand that 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:40.699

 this gadget that is a stick as of 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.240
 Round palette with one as you have seen 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.070
 the clothes racks where clothes are hung 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.580
 pretend that that part above 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.020
 where it goes to the hook or like a hook there 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.090
 this is used a lot especially in the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.070
 business where they sell crepes in san 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.919
 francisco for example at the hotel paris 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.139
 because obviously there are many 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.479
 business of crepas you there in the 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.820
 vegas' sorry there you put a 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.830
 little bit of good dough that I've seen in 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.229
 televisions I'm not presuming you 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.729
 they see for example on television that 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.430
 they're doing with some with soccer balls 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.590
 this size puts in mass and they already do this 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.470
 with a practice and a speed that you 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.950
 gives until envy do 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.100

 dough once made you have to rest the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.050
