00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
to eat the exact same thing so this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.960 
to eat the exact same thing so this
species<00:02:57.960> comes<00:02:58.470> from<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.800> genus<00:02:59.040> testudo<00:02:59.610> and

you'll<00:03:00.270> find<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.720> most<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> testudo

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
you'll find that most of the testudo

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.090 
you'll find that most of the testudo
species<00:03:02.520> or<00:03:02.850> genus<00:03:03.000> stay<00:03:03.990> very<00:03:04.290> small<00:03:04.800> and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
species or genus stay very small and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.980 
species or genus stay very small and
that's<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.550> good<00:03:05.700> thing<00:03:05.940> because<00:03:06.120> these<00:03:06.630> made

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
get big 8 inches is about the biggest

adults<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.920> these<00:03:47.580> guys<00:03:47.820> are<00:03:48.030> you're

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480

pretty<00:03:49.140> much<00:03:50.420> stereotypical<00:03:51.420> pet<00:03:52.200> tortoise

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
pretty much stereotypical pet tortoise

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.770 
pretty much stereotypical pet tortoise
and<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.340> think<00:03:53.580> they<00:03:53.730> make<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> better<00:03:54.390> choice

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
and I think they make a better choice

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.530 
and I think they make a better choice
than<00:03:55.110> some<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.220> your<00:03:56.400> russian<00:03:57.030> tortoises

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
than some of your russian tortoises

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.330 
than some of your russian tortoises
because<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.080> lot<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.500> russian<00:03:58.920> tortoises

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
because a lot of the russian tortoises

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.400 
because a lot of the russian tortoises
which<00:03:59.550> they<00:03:59.700> are<00:03:59.850> related<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.360> are<00:04:00.540> imported

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
which they are related to are imported

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.590 
which they are related to are imported
and<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.860> fact<00:04:02.190> there<00:04:02.610> are<00:04:02.760> many<00:04:03.060> Herman's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
and in fact there are many Herman's

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.479 
and in fact there are many Herman's
tortoises<00:04:04.050> that<00:04:04.200> are<00:04:04.350> imported<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.310> would

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
tortoises that are imported and I would

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.300 
tortoises that are imported and I would
say<00:04:05.670> don't<00:04:06.150> get<00:04:06.720> an<00:04:06.959> imported<00:04:07.500> tortoise<00:04:07.830> they

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
say don't get an imported tortoise they

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.220 
say don't get an imported tortoise they
just<00:04:08.640> never<00:04:08.850> do<00:04:09.180> very<00:04:09.450> well<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.170> country

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
just never do very well in this country

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.650 
just never do very well in this country
it<00:04:11.040> takes<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.430> long<00:04:11.640> time<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:12.030> acclimate<00:04:12.390> and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
it takes a long time to acclimate and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.199 
it takes a long time to acclimate and
usually<00:04:13.470> they<00:04:13.620> get<00:04:13.769> sick<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.280> die<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.940> always

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
usually they get sick and die so always

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.990 
usually they get sick and die so always
try<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.600> locate<00:04:15.900> nice<00:04:16.620> captive<00:04:17.400> raised<00:04:17.640> baby

these<00:04:27.749> guys<00:04:27.990> are<00:04:28.169> able<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.469> incubate<00:04:29.159> in<00:04:29.909> the

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
these guys are able to incubate in the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.520

they<00:04:31.740> also<00:04:32.009> hibernate<00:04:32.699> so<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:33.180> is<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> species

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
they also hibernate so this is a species

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.230 
they also hibernate so this is a species
that<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.199> take<00:04:34.499> cooler<00:04:34.830> temperatures<00:04:35.430> again

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
that can take cooler temperatures again

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.050

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.850 
cold but they can hibernate for short
periods<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.419> time<00:04:42.479> so<00:04:43.319> they<00:04:43.499> are<00:04:43.529> just

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
periods of time so they are just

that I think make fantastic pets of
course<00:07:02.650> there's<00:07:02.860> plenty<00:07:03.039> more<00:07:03.250> and<00:07:03.789> we'll

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
course there's plenty more and we'll

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.580 
course there's plenty more and we'll
investigate<00:07:04.389> them<00:07:04.690> in<00:07:04.990> the<00:07:05.110> months<00:07:05.409> and<00:07:05.530> years
