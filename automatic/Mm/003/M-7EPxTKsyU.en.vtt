 I'll call him hospital 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.700
 so here after here you put a 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.710
 comma after the quotation marks and there you 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 go put now actually a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.920
 space you remember to put 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.310

 mayor can also open the hospital 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.790
 it is a problem 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.390
 and suddenly my medical team is so 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.250
 if you do not know the name of your team 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.920
 you can retrieve it you know in 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.800
 the job point l ua and you just have to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.480
 go on the git up and get that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.410
 in your club for halluin and you 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.930
 go to your site 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.660
 here is the coloring to the alas here you 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.190
 have any new core business actually 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.030
 of arched rhdp after of course if you 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.620
 created a new job 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.739
 you just have to take you know the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.510
 team leader team meetic team major 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.239
 you what what you have created a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.070
 so here you are 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.410
 save and we'll see them that 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.700
 right away to see if the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.290
 changes have been made in 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.850
 account for may group 1 of doors and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.600
 here we are at stake we are going all 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.760
 immediately to the hospital to see if any 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.500
 blow I can configure my hospital with 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.420
 our new group should create 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.440
 so for that I go a little faster 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.910
 hop here is sent there the doors do not 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.120
 are not configured so imagine you 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.860
 that the hospital a mafia buys it 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.989
 It's not going to be very credible 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.930
 a lot for that protects evolved public 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.980
 we will tell the bank the police the place 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.600
 of spawn not that people can 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.120
 buy your doors and the hospital so 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.489
 for that just to do f2 see a little 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.780
 menu that often normally so bbl that 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.470
 it's to buy the door that's 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.190
 for wholesale removed kind if I buy it 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.370
 so select the door and here here 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.260
 so to handle my door may groups 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.850
 so I click on it and there you see 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.040
 is a very small menu that is displayed and 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.019
 I have my hospital just have to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.260
 click case simply smiles 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.120
 and now this door 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.510
 no one else will be able to buy it 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.040
 it will be only for doctors and after 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.840
 I can do that with all my friends 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.959
 are in the hospital like that i'm sure 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.410
 that there is no problem with that while 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.750
 simply 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.620
 it's that simple to us is 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.510
 quite fast 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.070
 after good it is true that it is necessary to 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.660
 do that at stake for all doors 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.879
 from this hospital 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.680
 so that was for my example you 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.519
 can do that for the police for 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.829
 for the town hall and for any other door 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.719
 that you want to block with the purchase as 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.879
 that at least nobody can buy them 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.709
 so that's what you all cough and a little 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.570
 tutorial today it was not very long 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.609
 it was not very difficult but good 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.949
 at least now you know how 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.509
 to configure your doors in game 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.590
 and I think it was important I 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.789
 know she had a lot who did not 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.020
 did not know how to do it and who would 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.220
 asked in the orders so this is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.560
 for that I wanted to make this video 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.660
 in any case it's as usual if 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.100

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.919
 you did not like it but hold ten mike and 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.570
 could leave me a little comment 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.240
 if you do not understand how that 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.009
 works or just to mark a 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.240
 little pot wish everyone a good 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.900
