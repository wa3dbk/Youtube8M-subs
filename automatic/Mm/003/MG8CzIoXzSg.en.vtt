strong players and here is some some
ideas<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.500> introduced<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
ideas that I introduced to you in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240 
ideas that I introduced to you in
opening<00:00:39.420> repertoire<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> develop

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
opening repertoire I want to develop

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.690 
opening repertoire I want to develop
them<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.629> refine<00:00:43.590> them<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.190> little

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
them and little refine them a little

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.260 
them and little refine them a little
more

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
more

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.250 
more
so<00:00:45.989> d5<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.399> main<00:00:47.640> move<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> that's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so d5 is the main move here and that's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.920 
so d5 is the main move here and that's
what<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> play<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.969> order<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> stop

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
what we want to play in order to stop

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.060 
what we want to play in order to stop
efore<00:00:52.910> d5<00:00:53.910> white<00:00:54.390> plays<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.020> tree<00:00:55.489> Bishop<00:00:56.690> e7

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
efore d5 white plays a tree Bishop e7

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
efore d5 white plays a tree Bishop e7
white<00:00:59.070> goes<00:00:59.460> F<00:00:59.789> war<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> that's<00:01:00.660> what<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
white goes F war and that's what the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.070 
white goes F war and that's what the
white<00:01:01.289> White's<00:01:01.829> idea<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:02.640> anytime<00:01:03.480> white

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
white White's idea was anytime white

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100 
white White's idea was anytime white
plays<00:01:04.470> f3<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> opening<00:01:05.990> theory<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
plays f3 in the opening theory in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.580 
plays f3 in the opening theory in
different<00:01:07.619> openings<00:01:08.210> there<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.659> after<00:01:10.500> II

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
different openings there it after II

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.060 
different openings there it after II
maybe<00:01:11.010> played<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:13.049> idea<00:01:13.229> only

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
maybe played with one and one idea only

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.050 
maybe played with one and one idea only
to<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.210> efore<00:01:15.950> otherwise<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.220> cannot<00:01:17.490> justify

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to go efore otherwise you cannot justify

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810 
to go efore otherwise you cannot justify
taking<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.049> f3<00:01:19.439> square<00:01:19.799> away<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.610> your

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
taking the f3 square away from your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.530 
taking the f3 square away from your
night<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.750> after<00:01:22.020> E<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.560> D<00:01:22.799> takes<00:01:23.070> e<00:01:23.310> F<00:01:24.090> takes

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
night so after E for D takes e F takes

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.280 
night so after E for D takes e F takes
II

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290

black<00:01:25.950> goes<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.520> 5<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> obviously<00:01:28.560> white<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
black goes a 5 and obviously white is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.910 
black goes a 5 and obviously white is
not<00:01:29.189> gonna<00:01:29.369> play<00:01:29.640> D<00:01:29.939> takes<00:01:30.270> e<00:01:30.590> because<00:01:31.590> Queen

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
not gonna play D takes e because Queen

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.300 
not gonna play D takes e because Queen
takes<00:01:32.159> D<00:01:32.520> 1<00:01:34.070> followed<00:01:35.070> by<00:01:35.340> Knight<00:01:35.610> g4<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
takes D 1 followed by Knight g4 so this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.590 
takes D 1 followed by Knight g4 so this
is<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:39.329> good<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.200> white<00:01:40.710> D<00:01:41.670> 5<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> main

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
is not good for white D 5 is the main

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.200 
is not good for white D 5 is the main
move<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.079> Bishop<00:01:43.409> c5<00:01:44.270> now<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.659> position

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
move and Bishop c5 now in this position

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.429 
move and Bishop c5 now in this position
there<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.390> 2<00:01:48.689> moves<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:51.200> actually<00:01:52.200> three

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there are 2 moves for actually three

votes for white the the main move is
Knight<00:01:58.680> f3<00:01:59.479> now<00:02:00.479> let's<00:02:00.750> look<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.310> move<00:02:02.310> like

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
Knight f3 now let's look at move like

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.230 
Knight f3 now let's look at move like
Bishop<00:02:02.939> e2<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.600> Bishop<00:02:04.110> e2<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:05.700> play<00:02:05.939> Knight

g4<00:02:06.840> threatening<00:02:07.590> Knight<00:02:07.799> f2<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:09.149> white

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
g4 threatening Knight f2 and when white

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.490 
g4 threatening Knight f2 and when white
plays<00:02:10.020> Bishop<00:02:10.140> takes<00:02:10.890> g4<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.360> Queen<00:02:12.750> h4

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
plays Bishop takes g4 we go Queen h4

g3 Queen takes g4 with a very good
position<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.670> white<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.520> that's<00:02:20.940> why<00:02:21.270> white

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
position for white so that's why white

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.650 
position for white so that's why white
doesn't<00:02:22.320> play<00:02:22.680> Bishop<00:02:22.890> e2<00:02:23.160> they<00:02:24.120> play<00:02:24.420> Knight

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
f3 is the main move but let's look at

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.080 
f3 is the main move but let's look at
Bishop<00:02:27.240> g4<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:27.810> well<00:02:28.100> now<00:02:29.100> we<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.520> go<00:02:29.700> Bishop

d4 or even go h6 Bishop h4 and now

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.250 
d4 or even go h6 Bishop h4 and now
Bishop<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.180> d4<00:02:38.540> white<00:02:39.540> continuous

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
Bishop to d4 white continuous

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.710 
Bishop to d4 white continuous
development<00:02:40.440> not<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:41.970> white<00:02:42.390> goes

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
development not is that if white goes

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.949 
development not is that if white goes
night<00:02:42.990> e<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.590> plug<00:02:44.580> goes<00:02:44.820> Bishop<00:02:45.330> g4<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.510> Y<00:02:48.900> goes

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
night e to plug goes Bishop g4 so Y goes
