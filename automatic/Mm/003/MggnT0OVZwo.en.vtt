most<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.899> us<00:00:06.990> don't<00:00:07.230> eat<00:00:07.529> as<00:00:07.680> much<00:00:07.830> fiber<00:00:08.189> as<00:00:08.519> we

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
most of us don't eat as much fiber as we

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.180 
most of us don't eat as much fiber as we
should<00:00:09.059> which<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.809> too<00:00:10.019> bad<00:00:10.230> since<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.830> offers

high-fiber<00:00:17.400> foods<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.880> also<00:00:18.029> filling<00:00:18.539> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
high-fiber foods are also filling and

all fibers function exactly the same way
which<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> why<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.930> often<00:00:28.109> talk<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.500> two

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
which is why we often talk about two

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.519 
which is why we often talk about two
types<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.640> fiber<00:00:29.939> soluble<00:00:30.570> fibers<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
types of fiber soluble fibers and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.910 
types of fiber soluble fibers and
insoluble<00:00:32.279> fibers<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:34.079> name<00:00:34.260> suggests

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
insoluble fibers as the name suggests

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
insoluble fibers as the name suggests
soluble<00:00:35.610> fibers<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.840> they

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
soluble fibers are just that they

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
soluble fibers are just that they
dissolve<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.950> water<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.640> when<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.210> fibers

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
dissolve in water and when these fibers

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200 
dissolve in water and when these fibers
dissolve<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.559> thicken<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.879> you've<00:00:42.059> ever

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
dissolve they thicken up if you've ever

cooked<00:00:42.540> oatmeal<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:43.290> home<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.890> probably

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
cooked oatmeal at home you probably

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.549 
cooked oatmeal at home you probably
notice<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.329> cooks<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.960> gets<00:00:46.140> thick

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
notice that as it cooks it gets thick

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.160 
notice that as it cooks it gets thick
and<00:00:46.920> gluey<00:00:47.219> that's<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> soluble

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and gluey that's because the soluble

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
and gluey that's because the soluble
fiber<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> oats<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.340> dissolving<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.059> the

liquid which makes your oatmeal a little

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.790 
liquid which makes your oatmeal a little

with the liquid in your stomach they

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.290 
with the liquid in your stomach they
swell<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.649> thicken<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.699> they<00:00:59.820> help<00:01:00.090> keep

regular maybe you've never thought about
it<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.299> actually<00:01:39.900> pretty<00:01:40.200> easy<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.770> tell

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it but it's actually pretty easy to tell

it but it's actually pretty easy to tell
these<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.490> fibers<00:01:41.970> apart<00:01:42.200> when<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> make

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
these two fibers apart when you make

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
these two fibers apart when you make
barley<00:01:44.040> soup<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.610> boil<00:01:44.850> potatoes<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.720> can

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
barley soup or boil potatoes you can

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
barley soup or boil potatoes you can
easily<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.710> how<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> liquid<00:01:47.280> thickens<00:01:47.880> up

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
easily see how the liquid thickens up

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.870 
easily see how the liquid thickens up
that's<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.530> barley<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.250> potatoes

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that's because the barley and potatoes

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.600 
that's because the barley and potatoes
are<00:01:51.090> high<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.540> soluble<00:01:51.930> fiber<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> cook

both<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.619> these<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.950> packed<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.429> water<00:02:08.670> but

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
both of these are packed in water but

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.690 
both of these are packed in water but
the<00:02:09.209> liquid<00:02:09.720> look<00:02:10.020> different<00:02:10.619> corn<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.670> a

the liquid look different corn is a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.360 
the liquid look different corn is a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.790 
grain and most of its fiber is insoluble
which<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.450> why<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.780> liquid<00:02:16.290> from<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.560> can

which is why the liquid from the can

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.920 
which is why the liquid from the can
looks<00:02:17.100> pretty<00:02:17.489> much<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.700> water<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.600> isn't

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
thick or sticky or gluey but if you look

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
thick or sticky or gluey but if you look
at<00:02:22.380> these<00:02:22.530> canned<00:02:22.920> beans<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.610> were<00:02:23.730> packed

at these canned beans that were packed
in<00:02:24.270> water<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.920> liquid<00:02:26.130> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
in water you can see that the liquid is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.000 
in water you can see that the liquid is
much<00:02:26.700> thicker<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:28.080> because<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.770> water

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
much thicker that's because the water

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.370 
much thicker that's because the water
soluble<00:02:29.850> fiber<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.480> beans<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.930> thickened

up the liquid that the beans are packed
in<00:02:33.600> since<00:02:34.380> your<00:02:34.560> body<00:02:34.709> needs<00:02:35.100> both<00:02:35.489> types<00:02:35.880> of
