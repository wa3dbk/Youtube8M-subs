for the underdog

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.160 
for the underdog
I<00:03:04.720> think<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.500> try<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.890> attempt<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> my<00:03:07.480> sense<00:03:07.930> of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
I think I try to attempt to my sense of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.650 
I think I try to attempt to my sense of
who<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.860> underdog<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:10.360> might<00:03:10.629> be

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
who the underdog is it might be

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.970 
who the underdog is it might be
different<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.110> your<00:03:11.290> sense<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
different to your sense of for the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.039 
different to your sense of for the
underdog<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.610> who<00:03:12.819> would<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.120> describe<00:03:13.780> as

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
underdog so who would you describe as

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.410 
underdog so who would you describe as
the<00:03:14.200> underdog<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.920> what<00:03:15.370> scenario<00:03:15.819> in<00:03:16.090> every

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
the underdog in what scenario in every

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.750 
the underdog in what scenario in every
scenario<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.530> social<00:03:17.889> scenario<00:03:18.340> let's<00:03:18.609> just

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
scenario in a social scenario let's just

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.220 
scenario in a social scenario let's just
take<00:03:18.940> anything<00:03:19.389> that<00:03:19.600> comes<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.079> your<00:03:20.170> mind

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
take anything that comes to your mind

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.680 
take anything that comes to your mind
because<00:03:21.040> obviously<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.000> dogs<00:03:22.209> would<00:03:22.450> be

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
because obviously and the dogs would be

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.110 
because obviously and the dogs would be
there'd<00:03:23.290> be<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:23.590> many<00:03:23.769> scenarios<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.790> over

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
there'd be so many scenarios all over

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.539 
there'd be so many scenarios all over
the<00:03:25.209> place<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.049> many<00:03:26.290> things<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.340> are

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
the place and so many things that are

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.580 
the place and so many things that are
happening<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.120> it's<00:03:28.269> very<00:03:28.420> difficult<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:29.170> pick

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
happening so it's very difficult to pick

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.770 
happening so it's very difficult to pick
one<00:03:29.859> but<00:03:30.250> I'm<00:03:30.370> asking<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.510> think

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.349 
one but I'm asking you to just think
about<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.319> think<00:03:32.440> about<00:03:32.739> one<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.250> would<00:03:34.150> say

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359

more<00:03:51.060> unfortunate<00:03:52.060> not<00:03:52.150> everyone<00:03:52.450> has<00:03:52.630> that

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
more unfortunate not everyone has that

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.390 
more unfortunate not everyone has that
opportunity<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:53.680> know<00:03:53.769> because<00:03:54.040> we<00:03:54.220> still

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
opportunity you know because we still

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.670 
opportunity you know because we still
come<00:03:54.549> from<00:03:54.609> an<00:03:54.910> from<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.810> time<00:03:56.139> when<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.590> were

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
come from an from the time when you were

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.220 
come from an from the time when you were
not<00:03:56.709> allowed<00:03:57.099> to<00:03:57.250> have<00:03:57.340> an<00:03:57.430> opinion<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:59.109> know

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
not allowed to have an opinion you know

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.409

so<00:03:59.560> people<00:03:59.859> are<00:04:00.280> still<00:04:00.489> stuck<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.150> right

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
so people are still stuck in that right
