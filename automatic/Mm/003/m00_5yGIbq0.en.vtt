00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 First, all these laid out ekranki 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 Batman vs. Superman teaser trailer 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.210
 Now the day has come when Zack Snider 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 decided to post it officially i want 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 to draw your attention to some things 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.900
 which can be overlooked is also possible 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.470
 there will be spoilers but they are built only on 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.840
 guessing 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.820
 in the beginning we see the superman statue on 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.130
 background which people share in opinions 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 someone afraid someone finds him 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:37.440
 no matter his savior 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:39.660
 parents were right he will maybe 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.910
 This Lex has set people on him by the way. 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.190
 that's what this decoration was for 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 further it is ben afflek in the image of bruce 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.340
 wayne looks at the costume and regrets that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.340
 removed nipples 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.989
 also we hear a voice that speaks of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.539
 him that this time he is powerless and he is from 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.370
 this in anger further we were shown how 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.589
 people are drawn to the superman and different 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 locations in which he visited for example 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.470
 this is superman saved by russian space 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.540
 ship 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.090
 probably something hit him and we will see 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 a scene like a plane rescue soldiers 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.650
 with the emblem of superman that reminded me of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.450
 comics injustice gods among us 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.729
 where he had an army of soldiers what 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.040
 patrolled the city maybe it's just 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.600
 someone's nightmare and finally ben 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.240
 affleck in a suit that no no here he 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.299
 looks oh so nice on a suit you 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.130
 You can also see the press further to us. 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.680
 show batman who is somewhere 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.530
 climbed the top of some building and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.930
 what is it what does he hold it really 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.820
 sniper rifle is already in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 comic book the return of the dark knight but 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.829
 so did not kill anyone then I saw 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.450
 the next one is on a flying jett or is it 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.729
 his batmobile can transform 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.290
 no matter here he shoots people 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.600
 after that hardly anyone at all 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.600
 can survive and the question really is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.130
 in this film adaptation batman killer 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.390
 will batman try to kill the joker at 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.830
 first opportunity 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.259
 although perhaps it is not at all batman zara 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.840
 at the end we see batman in armored 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.790
 modified voice suit armor 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.140
 looks like it means he's already 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.940
 used it earlier 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.530
 do you think batman hits 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.870
 superman both scriptonite
