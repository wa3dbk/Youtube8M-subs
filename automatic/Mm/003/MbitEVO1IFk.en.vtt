00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
are a tool to help us stay safe while

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:38.490 
are a tool to help us stay safe while
we're<00:01:26.240> out<00:01:26.270> there<00:01:26.540> keeping<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.900> public<00:01:27.110> safe

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.840 

the<00:01:39.500> training<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:39.979> pretty<00:01:40.159> much<00:01:40.280> everything

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
the training is pretty much everything

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.280 
the training is pretty much everything
when<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.030> comes<00:01:41.119> with<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.450> proper<00:01:41.780> selection<00:01:42.020> of

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
when it comes with a proper selection of

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.870 
when it comes with a proper selection of
the<00:01:42.380> dog<00:01:42.560> if<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:42.979> doesn't<00:01:43.280> have<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.460> proper

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
the dog if it doesn't have that proper

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.510 
the dog if it doesn't have that proper
foundation<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.479> training<00:01:44.899> then<00:01:45.470> it's<00:01:45.649> pretty

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
foundation of training then it's pretty

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.280 
foundation of training then it's pretty
much<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.909> useless<00:01:47.180> tool<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:47.840> training<00:01:48.140> is

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
much a useless tool so training is

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.020 
much a useless tool so training is
everything<00:01:48.890> for<00:01:49.070> these<00:01:49.220> dogs<00:01:49.460> kind<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:49.909> like

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
everything for these dogs kind of like

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.990 
everything for these dogs kind of like
it<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.270> for<00:01:50.420> people<00:01:50.450> also<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:52.369> state<00:01:52.610> requires

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
it is for people also the state requires

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.820 
it is for people also the state requires
a<00:01:53.119> certain<00:01:53.330> level<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.750> training<00:01:53.990> where<00:01:54.680> our

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
a certain level of training where our

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.139 
a certain level of training where our
expectations<00:01:55.490> are<00:01:55.610> actually<00:01:55.850> much<00:01:55.940> higher

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
expectations are actually much higher

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.969 
expectations are actually much higher
than<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.960> that's<00:01:57.110> one<00:01:57.409> reason<00:01:57.560> we<00:01:57.799> take

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
than that so that's one reason we take

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.830 
than that so that's one reason we take
