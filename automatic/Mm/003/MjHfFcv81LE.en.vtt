okay so remember it's not a race it's

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.080 
okay so remember it's not a race it's
not<00:04:50.620> important<00:04:51.160> that<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.370> play<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.729> as<00:04:51.849> fast

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
not important that you play it as fast

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.460 
not important that you play it as fast
as<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.360> can<00:04:52.599> what's<00:04:52.900> important<00:04:53.289> at<00:04:53.380> this

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
as you can what's important at this

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.290 
as you can what's important at this
stage<00:04:53.530> is<00:04:54.069> you<00:04:54.430> learn<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.759> hold<00:04:54.940> down<00:04:55.150> the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
stage is you learn to hold down the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.029 
stage is you learn to hold down the
notes<00:04:55.539> you<00:04:56.110> know<00:04:56.229> we're<00:04:56.410> learning<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.800> pluck

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
notes you know we're learning to pluck

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.499 
notes you know we're learning to pluck
the<00:04:57.130> strings<00:04:57.430> with<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.669> plectrum<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.389> we're

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
the strings with the plectrum and we're

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.730 
the strings with the plectrum and we're
learning<00:04:58.569> to<00:04:58.840> spread<00:04:59.110> our<00:04:59.199> fingers<00:04:59.590> like

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
learning to spread our fingers like

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.589 
learning to spread our fingers like
that's<00:04:59.949> what's<00:05:00.190> important<00:05:00.729> but<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.210> do<00:05:01.300> want

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599
