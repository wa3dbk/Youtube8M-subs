weeks a couple days ago and I just loved
it<00:00:19.949> unfortunately<00:00:20.730> my<00:00:20.880> hair<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.539> long

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it unfortunately my hair is not as long

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.730 
it unfortunately my hair is not as long
as<00:00:21.960> hers<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.070> said<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.430> know<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:24.000> hair<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
as hers but I said you know my hair is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
as hers but I said you know my hair is
approximately<00:00:25.740> four<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> half<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.029> five

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
approximately four and a half to five

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.660 
approximately four and a half to five
and<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> half<00:00:27.449> inches<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.380> i<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:29.010> i<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and a half inches so i think i can do it

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.429 
and a half inches so i think i can do it
i<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.029> i<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.869> not<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.080> come

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
i think i can do it it's not a come

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:56.350 
i think i can do it it's not a come
close<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:33.780> results

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.140 

so<00:00:56.960> there's<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.710> right<00:00:58.430> out<00:00:58.610> two<00:00:58.820> or<00:00:58.850> three

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
so there's a right out two or three

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.650 
so there's a right out two or three
braids<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.750> probably<00:01:00.170> have<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.740> redo<00:01:01.660> and

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
braids I probably have to redo and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.380 
braids I probably have to redo and
that's<00:01:02.840> because<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:04.580> hair<00:01:04.850> we're<00:01:05.270> starting

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
that's because the hair we're starting

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.890 
that's because the hair we're starting
to<00:01:05.600> slip<00:01:05.810> out<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.260> brain<00:01:07.540> Mike<00:01:08.540> I<00:01:08.570> sent<00:01:08.810> my

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
to slip out of the brain Mike I sent my

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.140 
to slip out of the brain Mike I sent my
hair<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.200> not<00:01:09.410> as<00:01:09.710> long<00:01:10.370> as<00:01:10.640> hers<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:13.150> there's

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
hair is not as long as hers so there's

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.700 
hair is not as long as hers so there's
something<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.600> practice<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.500> think

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
something to practice and I think

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.500 
something to practice and I think
concerned<00:01:16.370> that<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:16.790> my<00:01:16.940> first<00:01:17.240> try<00:01:17.479> I

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
concerned that this is my first try I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.780 
concerned that this is my first try I
think<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.870> did<00:01:18.050> pretty<00:01:18.080> good<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.800> think<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:19.610> did

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
think I did pretty good I think I did

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.960 
think I did pretty good I think I did
pretty<00:01:19.880> good<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.750> think<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.410> side<00:01:21.680> here<00:01:22.280> came

pretty good I think this side here came

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.840 
pretty good I think this side here came
out<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.180> lot<00:01:23.450> better<00:01:23.750> than<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:25.400> side<00:01:25.670> over

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
out a lot better than this side over

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.170 
out a lot better than this side over

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
root and a half capsule of metal that I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.940 
root and a half capsule of metal that I
also<00:02:26.570> added<00:02:26.959> avocado<00:02:27.620> oil<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.830> Colonel<00:02:30.830> room
