you have on your device and you can also
here's<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.780> switch<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
here's a little switch right here that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.679 
here's a little switch right here that
you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.829> invert<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> selection<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.420> tap

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you can invert the selection so if I tap

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.260 
you can invert the selection so if I tap
that<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.340> point<00:01:50.640> barrel

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
that so now at this point barrel

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.480 
that so now at this point barrel
calculator<00:01:51.840> Calendar<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.860> camera<00:01:53.310> are

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
locked so we don't really want to do

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.999 
locked so we don't really want to do
that<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.439> don't<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.710> all<00:01:58.860> our

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
disabling that so now let's get on to

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.250 
disabling that so now let's get on to
the<00:03:34.160> good<00:03:34.489> part<00:03:34.850> where<00:03:35.329> we<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.630> actually<00:03:36.019> try

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
the good part where we can actually try

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.500 
the good part where we can actually try
to<00:03:36.320> open<00:03:36.709> up<00:03:36.890> an<00:03:37.070> application<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.940> can<00:03:38.090> see<00:03:38.329> it

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
to open up an application you can see it

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.130 
to open up an application you can see it
it's<00:03:38.690> locked

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
it's locked

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.080 
it's locked
so<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:39.410> all<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.680> want<00:03:39.859> to<00:03:39.920> do<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.220> scan<00:03:40.850> your

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
so now all you want to do is scan your

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.120 
so now all you want to do is scan your
finger<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.680> you'll<00:03:42.680> see<00:03:42.859> that<00:03:43.010> it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
finger and you'll see that it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.000 
finger and you'll see that it
automatically<00:03:43.670> opens<00:03:44.480> right<00:03:44.750> up<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:45.829> can

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
automatically opens right up so you can

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.039 
automatically opens right up so you can
also<00:03:46.190> obviously<00:03:46.549> type<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.359> the<00:03:47.480> password<00:03:47.660> but

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
also obviously type in the password but

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.599 
also obviously type in the password but
that's<00:03:48.200> not<00:03:48.440> very<00:03:48.470> much<00:03:48.859> fun<00:03:49.070> especially<00:03:49.370> if

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
that's not very much fun especially if

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.420 
that's not very much fun especially if
you<00:03:49.700> have<00:03:49.910> an<00:03:50.030> iPhone<00:03:50.299> 5s<00:03:50.570> so<00:03:51.410> just<00:03:51.920> opening<00:03:52.310> it

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
you have an iPhone 5s so just opening it

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.849 
you have an iPhone 5s so just opening it
up<00:03:52.519> really<00:03:53.000> easy<00:03:53.329> just<00:03:53.810> like<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.350> it's

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
up really easy just like that it's

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.039 
up really easy just like that it's
really<00:03:55.220> cool<00:03:55.430> also<00:03:56.329> another<00:03:56.630> thing<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.900> keep

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
really cool also another thing to keep

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.110 
really cool also another thing to keep
in<00:03:57.200> mind<00:03:57.470> if<00:03:57.650> you're<00:03:57.980> opening<00:03:58.310> up<00:03:58.430> an<00:03:58.549> app<00:03:58.730> with

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
in mind if you're opening up an app with

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.870 
in mind if you're opening up an app with
the<00:03:59.299> touch<00:03:59.510> ID<00:03:59.780> sensor<00:04:00.250> your<00:04:01.250> finger<00:04:01.579> does

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
the touch ID sensor your finger does

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.120 
the touch ID sensor your finger does
have<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.329> safe<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:02.989> touch<00:04:03.109> ID<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.920> the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
have to be safe to the touch ID in the

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.099 
have to be safe to the touch ID in the
settings<00:04:04.549> if<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:05.000> use<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.299> different<00:04:05.900> finger

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
settings if you use a different finger

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.110 
settings if you use a different finger
you'll<00:04:06.680> see<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.190> not<00:04:07.400> only<00:04:07.609> does<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.000> not

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
you'll see that not only does it not

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.879 
you'll see that not only does it not
unlock<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.870> device<00:04:08.959> but<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.470> doesn't<00:04:09.769> even

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
unlock the device but it doesn't even

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.640 
unlock the device but it doesn't even
give<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> failed<00:04:10.790> attempt<00:04:11.299> so<00:04:11.930> just<00:04:12.380> keep

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
give you a failed attempt so just keep

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.340 
give you a failed attempt so just keep
that<00:04:12.680> in<00:04:12.950> mind<00:04:13.329> also<00:04:14.329> like<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.810> said<00:04:14.840> earlier

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
that in mind also like I said earlier

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.590 
that in mind also like I said earlier
the<00:04:15.590> folders<00:04:16.039> are<00:04:16.310> case<00:04:16.820> sensitive<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:17.359> you'll

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
the folders are case sensitive so you'll

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.029 
the folders are case sensitive so you'll
see<00:04:17.780> here<00:04:18.019> when<00:04:18.139> I<00:04:18.169> tap<00:04:18.410> on<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:18.799> it's

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
see here when I tap on this it's

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.370 
see here when I tap on this it's
actually<00:04:19.220> going<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.640> be<00:04:19.789> locked<00:04:20.200> because<00:04:21.200> I

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
actually going to be locked because I

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.250 
actually going to be locked because I
changed<00:04:21.830> that<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.159> to<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.430> capital<00:04:22.909> I<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.390> cool

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260
