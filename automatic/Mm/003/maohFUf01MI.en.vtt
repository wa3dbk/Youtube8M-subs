00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hi friends with you pashtorkin and this 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.189
 heading for beginners but 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.210
 I think that this 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.400
 This video can be useful not only 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.070
 beginners as well as experienced traders 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 cheeks then I'm working on 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.680
 with such blanks to withstand 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 Started a pair size 10 size 10 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:36.030
 billet already back and set to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.980
 the grip is pressed well to the lining here 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.960
 established habit which i will it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 do that and it means how to measure 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.620
 or let's say accurately profiled 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.739
 this is all business without special measurements 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.210
 of course you can use the Columbus 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.760
 columbus is such a measuring 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.559
 a device that has such a probe and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 using the probe let's say like this 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.630
 measure and display 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.580
 some size but all this in general 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.720
 you pretty arbitrarily and 2 is not 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 not really . 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.930
 measurement is also a lot of trouble 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.549
 which is generally ineffective now I tell you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.420
 I will show a very effective high-precision 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.930
 the way 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.700
 how can you get this size 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.350
 cutter on the lining 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.240
 on which are all these 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.240
 fixed clamped blanks and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.510
 we take the end measure tile iogansona here 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.660
 Desyatochka that's exactly the size 10 I need 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.450
 will get afterwards and let us down 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.080
 this tile under the mill so that she 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.360
 free so moved by 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.570
 handwheel vertical feed start 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.759
 raise the table to meet frez and do 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.100
 it is neat so that the cutter does not 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:18.540
 banged the slab the closer the cutter 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.540
 to tile 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.209
 so we try to do it more carefully and 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.950
 periodically we draw the cell 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:34.630
 table check free fell again a 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.750
 brought out again checked checked out again 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.580
 fell and like that little by little quietly 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.640
 approaching fresochki while all 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.910
 I still have no contact 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.060
 achieve a light touch 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.840
 so well, now I feel something under 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.360
 then another half sotochku 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.120
 it did not seem like flax 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200
 it seemed 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.739
 some coach 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.599
 so well here now now clearly there 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:13.720
 no longer so easy she moves already 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:18.040
 finger slips it is glued i stand here 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.849
 I picked it up with one pen, but now I 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.150
 I produce 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:26.349
 zeroing on vertical feed on 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:32.790
 flywheel which I thought the table and now 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:35.160
 I'll show you what we see here is zeroing 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.720
 this is 0. 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.620
 which I will have to return at 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.799
 milling to get size 10 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.640
 this size will be equivalent to tile 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:52.360
 iogansona i.e. milling work out 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.390
 within minus 1 weave given that 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.299
 it's so pretty here 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.630
 contact and at the end of the video means we are all 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.000
 check this thing now I want 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.850
 additionally show you except 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.489
 the fact that I zeroed here you need to put 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.100
 any integer on this one 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:16.239
 vertical ruler to make it easier 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.850
 Dysentery is not everything 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.739
 could show as my view was 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.180
 facing the ruler 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:31.320
 Well, here I have put it means 14 now 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.320
 we focus in addition so 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.849
 14 That's it at this point I need 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:40.729
 will be back when milling the size 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:46.159
 10 should coincide with this 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:49.580
 that's the way it means putting the camera 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:52.999
 on a tripod I will sometimes put a roller on 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.449
 pause but you won't see it very much and in 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.449
 process 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:01.999
 when it is completed and all 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:06.949
 we will make measurements so let's go 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:09.919
 yourself 790 turns I work on 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:13.339
 aluminum alloy and so drove 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.270
 I bring the cutter out of this point 0 and 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:19.569
 raise a little up 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.569
 lowering the table 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:01.400
 so i forgot a little about my pause on 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.080
 said a bunch of videos here 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.810
 a bunch of words and when I already realized that the video on 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.840
 the pause was too late and so here 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.240
 dear viewers 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.000
 we look what happened 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.400
 size 10 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.970
 without one weave maybe a little more 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:28.060
 than one weaving here such here 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:31.159
 This method of sight gives results 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:37.509
 Now I will show you this product to be 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:42.550
 clearly clearly visible hope this video 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:44.659
 I liked not only newbies, but already 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.069
 experienced users rather 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:53.270
 user milling workers 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:56.180
 machine and i want to ask if you this 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.810
 like the video press your finger up 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.000
 if you don't like something write that 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.909
 I did not like it and I will rework this video 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.389
 and we will see more improved 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:10.509
 thank you for your attention with you 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.319
