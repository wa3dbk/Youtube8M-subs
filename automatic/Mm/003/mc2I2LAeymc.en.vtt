00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
weekly if if you if you possibly can

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.189 
weekly if if you if you possibly can
because<00:06:23.550> that<00:06:23.880> will<00:06:24.060> prolong<00:06:24.479> their<00:06:24.720> life<00:06:24.870> one

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
because that will prolong their life one

because that will prolong their life one
that<00:06:25.229> would<00:06:25.560> live<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.770> year<00:06:26.220> could<00:06:27.139> brit

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
that would live a year could brit

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.020 
that would live a year could brit
brilliantly<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:29.010> ideally<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:29.669> could<00:06:29.849> live

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
brilliantly and ideally it could live

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.540 
brilliantly and ideally it could live
then<00:06:30.330> it<00:06:30.900> could<00:06:31.050> live<00:06:31.199> but<00:06:31.740> for<00:06:32.039> two<00:06:32.190> if<00:06:32.400> you

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
then it could live but for two if you

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.830 
then it could live but for two if you
alternated<00:06:33.090> it<00:06:33.180> between<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.479> two<00:06:33.570> if<00:06:33.690> that

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
alternated it between the two if that

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.250 
alternated it between the two if that
makes<00:06:34.020> sense

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
makes sense

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.550 
makes sense
