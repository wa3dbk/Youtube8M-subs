00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.080
 Today there is a fantastic send 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.880
 So come a delicious dish without them 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 really easy to do in the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.810
 infobox down in there normal spiced 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.260
 consumed that is a very cheap 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.570
 device 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.100
 So it gets very fragrant and me 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.170
 puts lot on monument and shows everything 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.019
 else comes in then poultry 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.820
 just remove the sinews and that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.200
 whole is then finely diced decibel 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.239
 then also rolled 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.530
 what we then talk about the spice mixture 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.829
 care which is then still the same in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.079
 to prepare mortars 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.140
 The meat is ready now I need 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.530
 still the onion and me my style 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.170
 eat relatively fine 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.600
 That's why we leave a little bit of time and time 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.600
 cuts into a small cube 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.119
 and as spices come today once 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.700
 allspice then we have cloves once and 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.380
 Coriander and other small bowl 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.490
 now have some turmeric and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.619
 black cumin then just the whole 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.790
 Put spices in the bowl and then 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.790
 crush with the norder 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.009
 and there is our own little krÃ¶ll 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.890
 prepared and available now 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.890
 some oil and then the onions to 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.840
 uwe and i forget all that people 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.000
 not to be brown and in a few 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.990
 seconds then just the birth are 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.990
 to put in the pot 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.710
 that's definitely great 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.710
 hot 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.149
 Immediately then come the meat and 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.019
 gave the garlic here you believe 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.849
 garlic should be all about then 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.470
 with the temperature thus play 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.450
 it does not get better and the coach 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.959
 add meat and for five minutes 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.959
 sear 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:32.230
 and now how the whole thing is still up 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:34.810
 the cream and the poultry fund, however 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.519
 Add the tomato paste and just 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.390
 simmer for a while 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.920
 about 15 to 20 minutes so lid 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.920
 just wait and see 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.299
 now it is tried the whole is ready 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.340
 has been simmering for about 30 minutes 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.530
 because it is a bit thinner 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.310
 was more than I thought I ever tried as 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.310
 delicious chicken 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.639
 it actually tastes a lot like 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.849
 I expected it, damn it 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.739
 tasty and pretty funny due to the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.370
 many ingredients such as the carton to 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.769
 it will be me, for example, or the carnations 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.720
 say very adventurer tastes so 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.280
 You can really delicious with the spice 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.840
 experiment a bit more 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.340
 Of course you can snowflake pure 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.260
 ton cayenne thus a bit 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.090
 The more exact and the sharper becomes the more precise 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.459
