now I'll show you guys where on the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
now I'll show you guys where on the
mini-map<00:00:40.829> exactly<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.390> right

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
mini-map exactly it is but it is right

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.760 
mini-map exactly it is but it is right
dead<00:00:42.840> center<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> middle<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> the

dead center in the middle of the
underground<00:00:44.340> tunnel<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.270> too<00:00:45.539> hard

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
underground tunnel so it's not too hard

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
underground tunnel so it's not too hard
to<00:00:45.899> find<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> plain<00:00:47.100> view<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to find it's right in plain view this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
to find it's right in plain view this
one<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> don't<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.600> could<00:00:48.870> miss<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.289> your

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.229 
one I don't think you could miss if your
life<00:00:49.649> depended<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.219> fairly<00:00:50.579> easy<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> find

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
life depended on it fairly easy to find

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.250 
life depended on it fairly easy to find
but<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.600> you're<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> middle<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> public

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

again I'll highlight where exactly on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500 
again I'll highlight where exactly on
the<00:01:07.530> map<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> via<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> mini-map<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.360> in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the map it is via the mini-map but in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
the map it is via the mini-map but in
the<00:01:09.659> caverns<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> pit

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
on a different elevation than you this
one<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.439> concealed<00:01:26.159> by<00:01:26.369> moss<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.970> all

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
one is also concealed by moss and all

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
one is also concealed by moss and all
that<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.960> tougher<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> find<00:01:28.470> but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that so this one is tougher to find but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.950 
that so this one is tougher to find but
moving<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.579> containment<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.689> one

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
moving on to containment this one is one

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
moving on to containment this one is one
that<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> open<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.400> people

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that is so out in the open that people

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
that is so out in the open that people
will<00:01:32.850> miss<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> spawn

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
will miss it this one is in the spawn

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.350 
will miss it this one is in the spawn
point<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.759> climb<00:01:36.119> up

into the second story oil change

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.429 
into the second story oil change
facility<00:01:38.850> look<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> window<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> look

facility look out the window and look

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.710 
facility look out the window and look
back<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.400> spawn<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.119> top<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> one

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
back out of the spawn it's on top of one

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.359

of the buildings behind the oil change
facility<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.210> an<00:01:45.360> easy<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> find<00:01:46.380> if

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
facility and it's an easy one to find if

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
facility and it's an easy one to find if
you're<00:01:47.009> looking<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you're looking right and you have a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
you're looking right and you have a
clear<00:01:48.869> line<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.079> sight<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
clear line of sight which out of that

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
clear line of sight which out of that
window<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.210> last<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.570> certainly<00:01:51.689> not

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
window you do now last but certainly not

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.660 
window you do now last but certainly not
least<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.590> another<00:01:52.979> one<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
least we have another one that is out of

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
least we have another one that is out of
the<00:01:53.970> map<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> close<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.960> spawn<00:01:55.290> points<00:01:55.590> this

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the map and close to spawn points this

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.469 
the map and close to spawn points this
one<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> lot<00:01:56.430> harder<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.850> find<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.329> my

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
one is a lot harder to find in my

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
one is a lot harder to find in my
opinion<00:01:57.810> possibly<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> toughest<00:01:59.130> up

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
opinion possibly one of the toughest up

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.160
