00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 or the girls and compass and welcome to 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.670
 another new video was seen in the title 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.360
 gameplay review of the pound in large 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.130
 5 online car and how to get it ok is 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.870
 a video that already made me so many 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.810
 wanting to bring him to lose was very 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.550
 excited by the idrac and I already have it 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.769
 found with the surprise that many 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660
 they will know that the leader is truly 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.970
 expensive seriously do not believe that you are going to 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 cost not a million or two but that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 it's going to cost three million dollars 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 how it was unlocked that first of all 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.450
 good is very easy to unlock not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 has a lot of difficulty if he has and takes 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.600
 a little bit of time but it's easy to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.540
 unlock the first thing they should do 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 it will be until the third robbery and 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.579
 must steal the leader from the base 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.469
 marine military once they have 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.050
 stolen from the aircraft carrier they end that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.610
 mission and they already have the leader to ok so 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 just here we are going to get 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.719
 travel and transportation and I will buy it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 with you as you can see there I have a 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.500
 little bit of money just a little bit 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.989
 to buy the book, let's buy it 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.549
 and as you see it, I have it available in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.659
 pegasus which is a vehicle that is asked to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.759
 pieces do not you think 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.829
 in that and with the mechanic or anything for the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.719
 style would be something weird but no no no 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.539
 can or does not remove configuration 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.759
 quickly we get radar 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.909
 to put the radar because otherwise I do not see 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.859
 where does it appear ok now you hydra 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.350
 will be available in pieces ok let's 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.030
 talk to pegasus to ask him for the leader 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.310
 to the truth that makes me really want 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.049
 playing with him leads is something that I have 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.250
 I've played a lot and I've played it 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.530
 Now I'm going to give you some little ones 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.079
 first of all, I'm going to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.060
 ask ok they have already given me leader and right now 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.409
 I'm going to see how he came down here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.329
 I guess with a shock I can go down yes 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 yes yes, I have my way of getting down 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.819
 look at this is a totally different style 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 new to get off a bridge or anything 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.030
 more do not do it in real life than if 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.579
 not if they are sent to see how you can see 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.439
 here is basically the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.569
 Libra I have a desire to try it 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.920
 as you can not see and right now I 'm going to remove 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.420
 the radar so you can see it from 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.819
 profile because I do not know I like it more 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.009
 how it looks like I see it it takes a 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.530
 little more to get on but let's 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.090
 removing the radar does not make me much 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.319
 I'm missing so I do not think I'm lost 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.349
 in the saints but yes 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.359
 it's pretty nice to me 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.859
 sincerely I loved it and the truth 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.019
 that looks pretty good to see we're going to 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.950
 put him friend so he gets in first 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.920
 ok person 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.879
 good as you see it is a vehicle 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.769
 extremely beautiful I'm not going to 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.209
 lie so I lie to them I'm going to 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.819
 I tell them it's an ugly car, yes and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.469
 this vehicle is beautiful and how 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.900
 you can see it is practically very 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.340
 easy to handle does not have great 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.069
 difficulty the truth that is quite 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.629
 pretty, that is, see how beautiful it is and what 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.950
 more father is that he can stay here 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.069
 floating to see let's put the train of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.530
 landing and now let's fix what 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.079
 just as they see it is quite large 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.480
 the truth that is huge to me I 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.310
 delighted and more than anything the size if it is 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.469
 quite big compared to what 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.569
 it could be basically the jet 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.569
 cassano with what they see if it's big enough 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.549
 and will see how it looks today have look 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.829
 what has the best of everything is that it is 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.989
 easy to use I suppose to see how 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.400
 the engines will go on I do not know is that 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.169
 I do not tell you that I had not driven it to 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.250
 see like that gets in and takes out the train of 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:19.470
 landing to see let's give it that way ok 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.330
 so this is changed and that with this he launched 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.340
 all 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.020
 the driving I see that it's basically 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.260
 just like the others to see let's see 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.420
 how lake today ayayay she already saw how it 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.100
 it makes you like that it's handled like a jet fighter 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.170
 good as they see it nothing else I have to 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.390
 press the right button and so it is handled 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.430
 the same with diet house is the car 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.680
 driving but well the best of it 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.840
 hydra is that if you are a newbie in which 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.630
 you can handle it perfectly 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.920
 look suppose let's go 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.720
 just above what he's doing 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.340
 the month they go clown so that they see that it is 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.110
 pretty easy to handle to see we're going to 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.760
 learn the engine because if we do not go 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.560
 to take half an hour to arrive and look 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.720
 how they see it is pretty easy to 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.730
 driving does not have great difficulty and to 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.490
 see we are close to the month bank ok 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.750
 let's now land just right to you and 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.030
 as they see it is a plane totally 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.890
 different about the way of 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.110
 land not as they see it this one can 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.270
 simply land with what they see can 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.459
 we can land like that or not 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.260
 I landed forward like any 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.120
 plane but can land 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.340
 in this simple way, I do not like 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.170
 you can see this is something difficult with 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.060
 other planes but with the leader it 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.880
 it becomes a fairly easy task not 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.900
 I was going to say something important to them 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.270
 I said how do you get 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.160
 I told them pretty much as how it is used 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.710
 a little bit in speed I'm sorry 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.990
 identically equal to the jet house but what 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.910
 important that I wanted to tell you was that 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.680
 if you do not have the three million 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.900
 of dollars to be able to play with the jet 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.669
 house my friend Carlos with has created a 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.380
 departure in which the jet is located 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.789
 house indeed if they want to play the jet 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.560
 home and have a good time with friends 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.120
 in the descriptions I'm going to leave the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.460
 departure it seems to me that it is only found 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.259
 for playstation3 and for what it's going 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.630
 doing to playstation 4 for xbox not 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.430
 is there and they download it 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.260
 added to the social club and so on 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.180
 you can play it not as you see it 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.710
 pretty pretty free to me honestly 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.630
 I liked it and the truth is that 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.970
 pretty well, it's not handled like a 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.220
 jet house but the advantage that this has 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.169
 plane is that if you are something newbie with 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.810
 what are the jets and these things 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.729
 Well, it's going to be easier for you not 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.349
 that as they see it lands in a way 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.810
 very simple the truth that is worth a lot 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.300
 I'm sorry, and the best part is that this 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.979
 we get it without going to what it's going 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.949
 making the military base not just with 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.479
 Call him what he is doing 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.639
 merriweather, I already say pegasus already 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.620
 we have this vehicle, not as they see it, 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.320
 pretty simple to handle the truth 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.150
 great difficulty the best of all is what 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.520
 that doing the driving the truth 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.410
 has loved the jet house is a vehicle 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 pretty good as you see it can be 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.820
 land without great difficulty nothing more 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.620
 it's something that they get used to a little 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.470
 I know it feels strange 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.699
 sincerely driving a plane towards 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.650
 up not since we're always 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.169
 used to basically 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.960
 handle them from another direction not 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.340
 always land the ones facing the front 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.440
 go out to the front and many more things 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.260
 see we will look to see we will throw 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.669
 a missile to this ok to see do not I do not want 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.830
 to land on top is fine I want to 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.900
 land just to the side as they see it 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.970
 can handle is much easier to 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.400
 handle this what you are doing to 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.199
 see these guys are attacking us to see 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.880
 friends because they try to attack me 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.340
 I kill them I kill them with the leader 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.740
 because this vehicle is brutal as 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.389
 see something good is that also I 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.580
 difficult to be killed on top of one of 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.020
 these and besides that there is the auto missile 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.060
 directed because this makes us homework 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.010
 much easier not as you see it is a 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.690
 mega plane to me sincerely has me 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.919
 delighted and the best of all is the 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.080
 driving not since it's pretty 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.480
 Simple to operate is not like others 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.730
 aircraft that became 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.710
 quite difficult and I tell you that it is 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.810
 pretty easy to handle to see how many 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.430
 friends are left to see I think that no longer 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.200
 we have many left but well we are going to 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.420
 leave these friends because if we do not 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.430
 they're going to be bothering me and seeing me 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.320
 is turning off the plane no no no 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.970
 ok let's go we 're going to go to the 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.560
 heaven because I want to go more to heaven and 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.940
 with what they see, the plane is quite good 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.770
 the truth I have loved you well 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.960
 me your opinion in the comments if not 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.030
 they have the 3 million are they do not go for the 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.440
 third robbery discharge the activity 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.240
 so they can play the least and 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.040
 try it and know how to handle a 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.690
 little bit not in the third holdup also 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.160
 they will be able to handle it but it seems to me 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.990
 that only the pilot is the one who is going to 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.430
 to be able to handle so boys but they 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.110
