00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:17.270 
part the completed back section should
look<00:03:03.090> something<00:03:03.330> like<00:03:03.510> this

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.710 

when<00:03:18.280> freestyling<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.090> front<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.660> always

when freestyling the front I always

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.229 
when freestyling the front I always
separate<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.739> small<00:03:21.160> section<00:03:21.670> in<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.880> back<00:03:22.060> of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.840 

I<00:03:33.530> lightly<00:03:34.530> roll<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:35.130> then<00:03:35.310> pin<00:03:35.610> these

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
I lightly roll and then pin these

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:52.570 
I lightly roll and then pin these
shorter<00:03:36.210> pieces<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> back<00:03:37.080> as<00:03:37.290> well
