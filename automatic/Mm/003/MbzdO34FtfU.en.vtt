00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
are a bit plain looking but in the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
are a bit plain looking but in the
latter<00:00:28.949> years<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.670> Khmer<00:00:29.939> would<00:00:30.090> very<00:00:30.300> funky

as well and it will give you the overall

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.789 
as well and it will give you the overall
speed<00:01:50.840> that's<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> gimmicky<00:01:52.770> thing
