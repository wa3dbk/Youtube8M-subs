00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.400
 like this recipe what we are going to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.950
 do this time are some chops 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.039
 pig in a cola that is 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.140
 very rich the quantities of the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.210
 ingredients will also be in the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.070
 description of the video 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.680
 but we are going to try to go 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.740
 mentioning 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.450
 and we already have the hot pan we are going to 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.960
 use 6 pork chops first the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.710
 let's seal let's put the ones that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.050
 We have 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.780
 olive 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.820
 in this case it is good 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:55.930
 we are going to seal 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.930
 they already have the salt and pepper the chops 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.760
 now let's seal 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.200
 You can put three money and then 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.200
 a couple of minutes 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.550
 we sealed all the gutters the six and I 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.980
 what I already showed in itself then the other 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.930
 three of the two sides can be given 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.200
 account when they are already sealed because 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.570
 moves in all venues easily 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.450
 in the instant here what we are going to do 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.270
 is to incorporate the other three 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.090
 that we had already sealed first 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.810
 and we're going to have all of our 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 ingredients 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.660
 people and two and a half cups of tomato 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.660
 diced 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.760
 the clinics already ending 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.560
 establishments but we are going to 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.750

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.630

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.690

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.960
