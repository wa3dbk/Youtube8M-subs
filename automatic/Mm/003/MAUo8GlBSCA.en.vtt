00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
been pretty healthy so I figured the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.570 
been pretty healthy so I figured the
feeling<00:01:00.970> would<00:01:01.090> pass<00:01:01.270> eventually<00:01:02.490> so<00:01:03.490> in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
feeling would pass eventually so in
