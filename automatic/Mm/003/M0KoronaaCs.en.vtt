00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
right decision I think that right to do

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.280 
right decision I think that right to do
that<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.559> did<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.280> happen<00:01:03.140> before<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> happens

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that and did it happen before it happens

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.670 
that and did it happen before it happens
in<00:01:04.650> business<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> time<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.530> know

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
in business all the time and you know

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160 
in business all the time and you know
the<00:01:08.159> difference<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> public

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the difference is what we do is public

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.380 
the difference is what we do is public
and<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.979> everybody<00:01:11.490> gets<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> chance<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.180> talk

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and so everybody gets a chance to talk

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.039 
and so everybody gets a chance to talk
about<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
about it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.820 
about it
and<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.890> did<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:15.150> that's<00:01:15.360> fine<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> think

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and they did and that's fine I think

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
and they did and that's fine I think
that's<00:01:16.979> end<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> day<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that's end of the day I think from a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.710 
that's end of the day I think from a
player's<00:01:19.140> standpoint<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:20.850> want<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.450> clear

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
player's standpoint you want that clear

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.050 
player's standpoint you want that clear
to<00:01:21.869> always<00:01:22.170> end<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.530> where<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
to always end up where you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.270 
to always end up where you
and<00:01:23.720> where<00:01:23.899> he<00:01:23.960> wants<00:01:24.320> in<00:01:24.439> though<00:01:24.680> man<00:01:24.890> it

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
and where he wants in though man it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.429 
and where he wants in though man it
takes<00:01:25.640> going<00:01:26.210> through<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:26.600> process<00:01:26.899> than

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
takes going through that process than

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.510 
takes going through that process than
it's<00:01:27.590> worth<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:29.079> obviously<00:01:30.079> in<00:01:30.530> my<00:01:30.740> opinion<00:01:31.280> I

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
it's worth and obviously in my opinion I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.179 
it's worth and obviously in my opinion I
think<00:01:31.880> he<00:01:32.600> did<00:01:32.840> exactly<00:01:33.259> what<00:01:33.350> he<00:01:33.530> should<00:01:33.799> do<00:01:34.009> I

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
think he did exactly what he should do I

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.700 
think he did exactly what he should do I
think<00:01:34.490> he<00:01:34.610> made<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.060> right<00:01:35.420> decision<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.320> I

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
think he made the right decision and I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.050 
think he made the right decision and I
think<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.039> didn't<00:01:37.310> today<00:01:37.549> that's<00:01:37.820> what<00:01:37.970> you

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
think it didn't today that's what you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.950 
think it didn't today that's what you
wanted<00:01:38.329> him<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.509> do

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960

knocked them out in the last two years
as<00:05:12.900> well<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:13.950> tells<00:05:14.190> us<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.610> we're

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
as well so that tells us that we're

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.040 
as well so that tells us that we're
right<00:05:15.180> there<00:05:16.010> but<00:05:17.010> we're<00:05:17.310> not<00:05:17.340> over<00:05:18.060> yet<00:05:18.990> and

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
right there but we're not over yet and

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.930 
right there but we're not over yet and
that's<00:05:19.410> what<00:05:19.620> we<00:05:19.740> have<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:20.010> get<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.460> year<00:05:20.730> I

that's what we have to get this year I

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.030
