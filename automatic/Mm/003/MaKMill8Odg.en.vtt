00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:08.020
Whoa, so this is where almond and coconut
milk come from, who would have thought?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.200
Oh, let’s get some almond milk.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.790
Wait a second, this can’t be right.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.570
There must be a way to get almond and coconut
milk without coming all the way to the farm,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.130
let’s find out.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:41.110
Hey fit fam, I know that was a little bit
crazy and I don’t have any almond and coconut

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.110
cows.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.750
So today I’m going to show you how to make
your own almond and coconut milk in your kitchen.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.570
What ingredients will you need?

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.119
Almonds and coconut of course, let’s get
milking.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.820
The night before soak your almonds in water.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.830
The next morning, drain the water and rinse
off the almonds.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.909
They’ll feel a little squishy.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.260
Place the almonds in your food processor and
add water.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.370
Pulse a few times to break those babies up
and then let it run for about three to four

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.370
minutes.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:22.110
Time may vary with the blender.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.750
Place your strainer over a large mixing bowl,
lay on a couple of layers of cheese cloth

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.870
and pour in the processed almond milk.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.070
You may also use a nut bag if you prefer.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.350
Allow to strain and then squeeze the cheese
cloth around the meal to drain any excess

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.350
milk.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.690
Feel free to save the almond meal for baking.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:54.510
Pour your strained milk into a mason jar and
store in the refrigerator for up to two days.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.710
Bring water to a boil in a pot and then turn
off the heat.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.299
Allow to cool for one minute.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.080
Pour your dried shredded coconut into your
food processor and add your hot water.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.310
Let the hot water and coconut sit for a few
minutes to allow the coconut to soften.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.660
Pulse in the food processor a couple of times
and then let it run for about two minutes.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.980
Same as with the almond milk, place your strainer
over a large mixing bowl.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.170
Lay on a couple of layers of cheese cloth
and pour in the milk.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.630
It should pass more easily through the cloth.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.750
Again, allow to strain and then squeeze the
coconut and the cheese cloth to drain any

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.090
excess milk.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:40.480
If you’ve got a dehydrator, dry your coconut
pulp for coconut flour.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.560
Pour your strained milk into a mason jar and
store in the refrigerator for up to four days

00:02:44.560 --> 00:03:00.010
or in the freezer for up to three months.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.230
So what exactly are the benefits to making
your own almond and coconut milk versus buying

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.520
them in the store?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.840
Well if you’re like me, you like your food
simple and the more ingredients I can pronounce,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.840
the better.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.640
So when I make my own almond and coconut milk,
I know exactly what’s going in without any

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.030
additives or preservatives.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.500
Just almonds and coconuts, woo hoo.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.540
And there you have it, homemade coconut and
almond milk right from the comfort of your

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.540
own kitchen.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.700

Let’s milk these nuts.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.019
Let’s get to milking.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.230
Have some milk for me?

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.660
Let’s find the udders.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.440
Christian: You can’t say that, it’s too
creepy.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440
Whoaaaa.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440
So good…

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440
I’m sorry.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.709
Who would have thought?

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.289
I don’t know what to say.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.520
Christian: Maybe say like, oh ha…hello there.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.629
Who would have thought?

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.210
Let’s milk this almond.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.979
It feels so disconnected, I’m missing something.
