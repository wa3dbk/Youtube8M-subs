00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.480
 it's not how often you win 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.090
 it's about how often you return 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.500
 Do you think you'll get up again? 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 if you have my speed stacks again 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.639
 How often have you walked in 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.350
 Continue when you're at it 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.910
 the remains of an army from the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.100
 test limits battlefield repeal 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.130
 closer to that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 here the wheat is separated from the chaff 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.179
 Starcraft is more than a game 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.790
 Starcraft is a way of life 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.930
 we do everything about the moments of victory 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 to be able to savor 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.129
 in the beginning if few but all the more 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.559
 be more valuable moments 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.360
 They drive us on to continue 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.809
 inner strength which forces us to better 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.910
 become 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.289
 which forces us to new sides and should 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.449
 but we are always on 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.649
 ground 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.780
 we have given everything but it has 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.449
 not enough to max our opponent 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.789
 stop vans it could be that easy 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.519
 just throw everything away the way 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.850
 least resistance 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.369
 i could also do a round it no or 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 Assassin's creed game 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.530
 I like to have it only when it does 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 stay like it is but rudi simon 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.369
 I know that you are in me, I know 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560
 that we can do when you are 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.540
 work 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.310
 nothing is given to you 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.030
 to reach the gold again is one 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.950
 long way 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.689
 here I started to describe him 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.450
 and I know it's hard 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.030
 but thus made can you have to 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.439
 ask you this one question 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 I am ready to my comfort zone 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.950
 leave 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.350
 I'm ready for my goals too 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.060
 fight 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.830
 if so then it is because the world 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.750
 outside shows that it is in you 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.670
 that we can get up again 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.960
 no matter how far you smashed the floor 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.960
 was the spark of Bosch he puts you
