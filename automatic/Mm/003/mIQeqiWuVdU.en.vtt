00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello I'm simon your muscle maker 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.530
 I'll show you one on this video 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.120
 special bank expresses technology with the in 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.799
 its very strong pump the breast 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.299
 especially in this one can get 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.039
 you will notice the inner chest area 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.380
 that there is a very special one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.090
 But stress is also the triceps 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.710
 has to work properly and is 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 by the way, especially stressed 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 yes, the whole is called dom to dom 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.119
 bank press or in English 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.279
 came together 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.990
 you let the thumbs almost together 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 That's exactly what the right grip is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.100
 distance so the grip is so 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.850
 chosen that the thumbs straight to each other 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.469
 still touching 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.820
 Of course you have to if you have the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.050
 selected the appropriate distance 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 still with the thumb around the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.170
 rod I rummel in the position 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.950
 start to squeeze it hugely 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.510
 unstable 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.760
 I always go around with my thumb 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.500
 The bar around so full and grab 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 no grip on the braces are also many 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 make the grip and know too 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.879
 The bars are not exactly the field here 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 out because they are doing that for years now 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 no problem 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 important, however, is that one firm 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.420
 handle and I have the firm grip 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.760
 Whenever I close the pole 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.149
 closed so grip has distance is 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.129
 clear 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.049
 then thumb around the bar around 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.369
 Of course, again with the little ones 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.930
 finger that look outward 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.250
 the right distance meets and the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.299
 I somehow crooked almost 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.729
 because otherwise the burden of course 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.650
 also uneven comes that is mine 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.939
 big problem what you so at the latest 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.009
 at the second third repetition 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.720
 that means the handle distance is clear 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 tremendously important the grip gap 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 inside is calculated by the thumb to thumb 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.100
 and on the outside the little finger 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 to look at a mark 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 the whole thing is known of course so me 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.630
 Show you the whole time like it with me 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 I just do not have anymore 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.140
 weight because it is here on the pole 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.650
 but I think you will anyway 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.630
 can recognize quite well so grip 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.530
 first look outward 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.479
 orientate 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.399
 Then I would watch that you thumb 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.740
 thumbs is very important 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.399
 outwardly so unpleasant with the orient 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.290
 thumb around 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.200
 That's exactly the right range 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.810
 Now we'll make a hollow cross and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.930
 Of course, cross is always good 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.880
 is strong to put out the breast and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.100
 school the weight off the load so 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.600
 now also press very similar 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.000
 like the classic bank press 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:11.090
 the burden from the deep of the breast 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.730
 out the difficulty is you notice 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.410
 the balance is of course the same 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:39.440
 Of course, you are in a closer position 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:40.640
 can not stabilize so well so you 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.830
 I believe I can recognize now 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.450
 how the whole thing looks like I said 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.049
 distance is everything is very important 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.790
 Thing 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.930
 Of feeling you can of course also notice 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.160
 just that here in these inner ones 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.349
 area of ​​the breast goes in 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.120
 it's not that special with it 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.069
 The inner chest is trained to train you 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.750
 the chest muscle in and of itself is the 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.459
 not normally divided into inner outer 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.170
 or whatever that is just like that 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.700
 that the pressure is special here in the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.590
 Of course, the inner area is good 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.329
 when you realize I actually meet 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.160
 my target muscle i actually notice 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.989
 the point in the chest because you know that 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.430
 So you do some things right too 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.500
 It's just the triceps 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.790
 Involvement of the triceps year substantially 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.230
 to do more work than when 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.269
 classic bench press with 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.739
 Shoulder widths or slightly more than 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.090
 shoulder widths handled a great 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.650
 Variantte to bring in the times 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.359
 one knows positive bank presses 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.650
 then you know negative bench press 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.730
 can we push the wide wall that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.069
 not so nice for the shoulder 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.930
 the tight band back together have you too 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.400
 know it just crux of the matter, the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.200
 is on the joints so a little bit goes 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.310
 Bandaging also brings with it little 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.299
 you manage to pass passengers in the reason 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.430
 taken no remedy 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.959
 Nonetheless, it is a good variant 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.639
 you have to deal with the weight more 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.500
 Reach the matter and then you tell 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.880
 Also a nice on already so I hope 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.709
 you liked my video 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.790
 motivates me to make more videos 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.980
 where I give you a little something again 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.900
 show about the muscle structure in which you 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.160
 I do not care how your opinion 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.720
 below of this video 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.430
 I want to read something in the comments 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.440
 And above all, I want a lot of thumbs 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.299
 no matter in which direction we see 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.690
 in the next video many greetings yours 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.690
