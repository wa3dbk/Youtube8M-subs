 dinaldo the massaranduba and sigic o 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.769
 Brazilian massaranduba joined fc 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.559
 through the first edition of tuf Brazil 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.600
 and in which the deleno heleno in his debut 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.359
 no fc 147 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.519
 before that it has a record of 10 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.559
 victories and only one defeat 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.760
 conquered the lightweight belt of the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.429
 devil fight 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.589
 the American has to own a 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.450
 history of eight wins and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.340
 no defeat before entering the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.790
 good octagon but was defeated by 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.159
 marcelândia in his competition debut 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.070
 mass is a big guy for the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.600
 and has a lot of physical strength and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.299
 knockout power 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 it also moves very well with 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.420
 great movement of legs and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.479
 head 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.740
 still has a great differential and its 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.920
 iron chin 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 the guy does not fall for nothing the Brazilian 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.250
 still has good fall protection 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.799
 good customer some good ground control 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 defense of finalizations and excellent 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.359
 ground 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.130
 the American has a Thai muay background 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.130
 and wrestling but has a different style 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.579
 and francisco because he prefers to attack in the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.070
 against the traxx years with the kers and 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.009
 hendrix or taking the fight to the ground 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.820
 where i use bruno paulo efficiently 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.159
 my guess is a knockout of massaranduba 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.020
 still in the first round or in the beginning of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.720
 second workout 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.280
 goes up all the time and is already in the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.890
 Brazil 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.440
 go with even greater will against 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.810
 attack it is that being absorbed by the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.150
 excellent that this Brazilian who is going 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.590
 find a good blow and take your 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.590
 opponent to the canvas 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.720
 in the fight of pp and milton vieira some 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.680
 certainties the first one a Brazilian left 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.440
 victorious 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.230
 Monday the fight goes to the ground an almost 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.959
 third certainty there will be finalization 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.540
 in his previous fights in showed a 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.150
 excellent floor Ceará likes to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.640
 change the ep and pull it to the guard without 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.560
 Triangle on both sides and 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.370
 the right arm of the product. 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.769
 client 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.870
 milton vieira is grappling master o 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.660
 experienced fighter is excellent in all 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.030
 the aspects attack to finish the scrape 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.900
 controls and is also good at ground and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 pound 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.569
 at 11 pp and I'm sorry but scallop 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.170
 advantage in all aspects of the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.569
 game 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.450
 respect a very unpredictable strike and 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.420
 dangerous for himself attacks with 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.010
 crossed the wire keeps the chin 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.989
 in the clouds 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.209
 then tries to close but does not have good 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.760
 falls so pull to goiânia 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.390
 if you do, milton will not crack and 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.459
 control and finalize the opponent in the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.549
 peer case will play defensive milton 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.859
 have great falls both in gay and 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.660
 rest link sure leads to ground 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:42.329
 imposes his excellent submission game 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.639
 samba move and so the attacks dp and no 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.950
 ground are limited to kimura and 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.920
 triangles touched me over 13 years of 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.040
 experience of mma should not fall into a 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.239
 This milton takes this by finalization 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.239
 in round 2 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.590
 the analysis now of the fight of ronny markes 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.140
 that hendron weak marques is considered 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.990
 today one of the mouse prospects of brazil 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.840
 for the category of 84 kilos in its 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.060
 first appearance in the ufc potiguar led 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.190
 the best against Carlos and Mulan and in 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.040
 against the top contender is a 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.880
 singsong marx style is no secret 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.280
 to no one 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.310
 the Brazilian takes a lot of advantage in the strength 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.070
 but it was already big for 93 kilos 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.830
 reducing to 84 is enormous for 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.080
 category and uses it very well. 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.780
 likes to pressure opponents against 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.190
 the knee grate to the knee and the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.020
 opponent's belly 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.870
 besides some elbows between 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.870
 creches combines account style giving a 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.170
 using muscle jiu-jitsu techniques and 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.540
 an excellent physical condition 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.850
 between crack is considered to be the round 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.940
 the American knows everything 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.800
 little but not good nothing has reasonable 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.140
 gives you a higher difference for the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.690
 floor is reasonable in strike but commits 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.000
 many mistakes on the floor defended as well as 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.360
 gives way to finishing in the shed 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.540
 effective but not deadly 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.170
 let's the ever for this fight 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.480
 marx must take by unanimous decision but 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.240
 he must use his physical strength to lead 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.800
 the meen channel quench and to the floor but not 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.830
 from steroids to 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.890
 knock him out andrew was warned about the 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.720
 fight a short time ago so it should take 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.120
 disadvantage in the conditioning issue 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.560
 physicist entered despite not being good at 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.650
 ground knows how to use the grid well to 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.560
 raise if this fight should be more in 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.840
 foot and between what may even hit a 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.300
 kino network unaware and not a good one 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.520
 defender roni but the most 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.740
 likely roni weary American 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.140
 enough that it can not 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.310
 knock him out and take a 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.310
 unanimous decision
