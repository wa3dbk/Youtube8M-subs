00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
their sb900 speed light but just before

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.240 
their sb900 speed light but just before
we<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.390> we're<00:02:49.140> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.410> tell<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:50.099> is

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
we go we're going to tell you here is

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.039 
we go we're going to tell you here is
the<00:02:50.549> slide<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:51.239> where<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.569> select<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
the slide is where we select the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.330 
the slide is where we select the
channels<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> test<00:02:53.879> button<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:55.340> up

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
channels this is a test button and up

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.210 
channels this is a test button and up
here<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.450> little<00:02:57.780> straight<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.010> go

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
here it's a little straight there we go

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.460 
here it's a little straight there we go
it's<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.849> little<00:03:00.030> switch<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.959> what<00:03:01.200> if

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
it's a little switch there and what if

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.220 
it's a little switch there and what if
switch<00:03:01.709> does<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:03.060> allows<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.780> switch

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
switch does is it allows you to switch

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.360 
switch does is it allows you to switch
between<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:05.220> local<00:03:06.209> flight<00:03:06.480> or<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.739> V<00:03:08.040> multi

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
between a local flight or a V multi

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.460 
between a local flight or a V multi
flies<00:03:08.609> so<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.420> means<00:03:09.660> we<00:03:09.870> could<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.079> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
flies so that means we could have a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.280 
flies so that means we could have a
local<00:03:10.890> flight<00:03:11.099> based<00:03:11.519> here<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.269> then<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:13.109> can

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
local flight based here and then we can

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.849 
local flight based here and then we can
have<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.739> remote<00:03:14.129> flies<00:03:14.670> based<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:16.109> horizon

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
have a remote flies based on the horizon

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.879 
have a remote flies based on the horizon
so<00:03:17.370> we<00:03:17.519> have<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.880> option<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.889> independently

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
so we have the option of independently

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.390 
so we have the option of independently
firing<00:03:20.730> random<00:03:21.000> flashes<00:03:21.660> our<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.919> flip

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
firing random flashes our if we flip

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.420 
firing random flashes our if we flip
them<00:03:23.639> to<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> middle<00:03:24.389> we<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:24.959> fire<00:03:25.680> both<00:03:26.160> at

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
them to the middle we can fire both at

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.120 
them to the middle we can fire both at
the<00:03:26.609> same<00:03:26.819> side<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.049> YouTube<00:03:28.739> I'm<00:03:28.950> going

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
the same side and like YouTube I'm going

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.120 
the same side and like YouTube I'm going
to<00:03:29.190> move<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.790> show<00:03:30.389> you<00:03:30.500> how<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.680> looks<00:03:31.709> on

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
to move on and show you how it looks on

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:42.740 
to move on and show you how it looks on
