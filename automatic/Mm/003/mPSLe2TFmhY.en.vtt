whatever<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.810> community<00:02:16.290> ass<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:17.520> imagine

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
whatever the community ass just imagine

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.940 
whatever the community ass just imagine
if<00:02:18.180> they<00:02:18.360> put<00:02:18.570> gold<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.230> diamond<00:02:19.590> came<00:02:19.770> up

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.730 
if they put gold and diamond came up
believe<00:02:20.400> they<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:21.210> have<00:02:21.720> some<00:02:22.050> pictures

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
believe they are I have some pictures

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.220 
believe they are I have some pictures
that<00:02:23.160> show<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.760> they're<00:02:24.090> possibly<00:02:24.450> might<00:02:25.200> be

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that show like they're possibly might be

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.550 
that show like they're possibly might be
so<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.070> all<00:02:26.250> kind<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.700> depends<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.230> doing

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
so it all kind of depends but the doing

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
so it all kind of depends but the doing
