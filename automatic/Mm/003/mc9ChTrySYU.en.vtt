00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
the same reasoning there oh I built some

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.579 
the same reasoning there oh I built some
church<00:00:06.210> just<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:06.600> case<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:06.960> those<00:00:07.049> void<00:00:07.319> rays

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
church just in case for those void rays

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.509 
church just in case for those void rays
because<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:09.050> wasn't<00:00:10.050> sure<00:00:10.349> he's<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.400> have

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
because I wasn't sure he's going to have

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
really annoying because I don't have

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.689 
really annoying because I don't have
that<00:00:16.350> many<00:00:16.500> Marines<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.340> four<00:00:17.580> or

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the distance from seven to six I could

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.179 
the distance from seven to six I could
use<00:00:24.510> my<00:00:24.660> Marines<00:00:24.990> more<00:00:25.260> effectively<00:00:25.680> against

the zealots what's going on at my base I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
the zealots what's going on at my base I
scan<00:00:37.110> him<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.410> he<00:00:37.890> kind<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.160> gets<00:00:38.250> angry<00:00:38.520> about

joking around but it was let's go back

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.069 
joking around but it was let's go back
to<00:00:43.920> his<00:00:44.010> base<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> second<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.960> does

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to his base for a second and what does

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.770 
to his base for a second and what does
he<00:00:46.230> build<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.610> couple<00:00:48.600> more

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
he build in here a couple more

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.000 
he build in here a couple more
candidates<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.410> these<00:00:49.530> candidacies

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
candidates you see these candidacies

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
candidates you see these candidacies
building<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.120> those<00:00:51.329> cannons

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
building I really think those cannons

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.830 
building I really think those cannons
could<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.500> used<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.890> more<00:00:53.789> gateways<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.510> more

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
could be used for more gateways or more

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 
could be used for more gateways or more
forces<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.370> building<00:00:56.640> gateways<00:00:56.910> here

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
forces you see in building gateways here

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
forces you see in building gateways here
because<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> let<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.719> minerals<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.289> too<00:00:58.440> high

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
because you let as minerals get too high

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
because you let as minerals get too high
but<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.280> built<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.640> gateways<00:01:00.000> earlier

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
but if you built those gateways earlier

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
but if you built those gateways earlier
on<00:01:00.629> instead<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.020> those<00:01:01.170> cannons<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:02.129> could

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
on instead of those cannons you could

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.039 
on instead of those cannons you could
have<00:01:02.340> used<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.149> minerals<00:01:03.329> used<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> those

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
have used all the minerals used on those

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.429 
have used all the minerals used on those
other<00:01:04.260> cannons<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.430> an<00:01:05.580> army<00:01:06.110> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.290> see

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
other cannons for for an army if you see

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.950 
other cannons for for an army if you see
right<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:07.650> i'm<00:01:07.799> getting<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> stem<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
right now i'm getting the stem in the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.510 
right now i'm getting the stem in the
siege<00:01:10.200> upgrade<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> tanks<00:01:11.189> being<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
siege upgrade for the tanks being a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
siege upgrade for the tanks being a
raven<00:01:11.880> tank<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.909> i<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.240> some<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> money

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
raven tank so i think some of the money

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640 
raven tank so i think some of the money
can<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.320> used<00:01:16.549> more<00:01:17.549> wisely<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.299> him<00:01:18.500> let's<00:01:19.500> go

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
can be used more wisely for him let's go

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310 
can be used more wisely for him let's go
back<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.830> my<00:01:20.070> side<00:01:20.280> here

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
back to my side here

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.500 
back to my side here
I'm<00:01:23.159> building<00:01:23.610> close<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.090> commitment

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
I'm building close to my commitment

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.630 
I'm building close to my commitment
command<00:01:24.900> center<00:01:25.170> you'll<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:26.490> I've

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
command center you'll see because I've

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
command center you'll see because I've
learned<00:01:26.880> over<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.750> few<00:01:27.990> games<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.470> map<00:01:28.680> if

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.200 
learned over a few games on this map if
you<00:01:29.040> build<00:01:29.250> around<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.790> mineral<00:01:30.060> patch

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
