 nor is that with the beer is now 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:26.540
 at the time it was unknown how 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:28.540
 many voices joined a big cinema for 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.280
 you are still good at organizing high-flyers 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.680
 that will change we have the yes 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.149
 big opening event here and 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.920
 there you stand but then on the stage and 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.390
 moderated and the room will be full 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.610
 I can not promise you that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.860
 what I wear 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.360
 how do you prepare yourself the day before? 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.100
 that's just the first one when I e-mail that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.229
 got the softness in new york 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.830
 and me so falko yes i would do that 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.810
 but what do I put on 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.130
 I have half an idea but that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.810
 depends on if the weather stays that way 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.680
 now it could be a bit 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.140
 become difficult 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.030
 I can say for myself beforehand 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.520
 a spontaneous decision yes little 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.710
 Spontaneous person so totally so mostly 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.179
 I'm planning something long before and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.120
 throw is half an hour before or 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.190
 times a complete clock with the so 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.450
 Are you going to survive now? 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.500
 already mentally in front of something to tell 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.150
 want or will come later 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.680
 short-term I totally prepare 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.060
 especially since I'm always in demand 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.010
 Will you ever send us that? 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.060
 Moderation because we wanted there 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.250
 look over it and I have now too 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.290
 already written something down but so me 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.049
 Of course not one hundred percent 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.030
 So doing everything to stay just to keep a 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.280
 bit to please me 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.590
 not a great total pig 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.019
 will make jokes or so although I 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.790
 that likes to read that one 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.230
 your skills will have to be 37 yes 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.640
 my mother helga banned this no 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.790
 because I can joke totally hard 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.079
 remember and there is a joke that can 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.430
 I remember and my mother has me 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.430
 forbidden to recommend 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.760
 Okay, okay, so I'll fit a small one 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.190
 Skunk family and a duck family 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.079
 go over a busy street and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.030
 suddenly a huge truck comes and 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.889
 drives everyone dead down to the smallest 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.630
 duck and the smallest skunk 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:17.269
 and it's not the smallest of them all 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.070
 dead and I do not know what I am 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.720
 Nobody told me what I am when 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.730
 I am a human or an animal what am I 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.040
 because that was also the small so well 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.199
 look really so 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.269
 you will be small and sweet and hate feathers 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.829
 and probably you will become a beak 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.150
 little duckling the duckling is happy 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.919
 Totally the skunk totally rested 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.419
 but i have the same problem i know 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.180
 not what I am what I am because 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.850
 human animal and he looks a nice 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.730
 agreed and you leave it everywhere 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:59.109
 you are small and hairy and you are standing 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:01.430
 probably you are absolutely 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.590
 if you lose even at the opening 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.560
 I have no principle in principle 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.880
 problem with that 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.130
 but you realize that you actually 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.470
 according to industrial in one 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:18.229
 Mainly professional was the list 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.389
 insert what what are you talking about everything me 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.630
 I've seen and how series so grinned in 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.550
 the family and g hafencity you have 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.550
 So anything now is he 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.110
 thus the how one just stopped 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.610
 he thus the kid and cartoon 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.949
 things and that is still mine 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.949
 main thing and meanwhile I do 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:41.270
 also real people so gray's anatomy 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:43.430
 is the best known and all that 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.040
 accumulates and with the children things 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.680
 So somehow bibi blocksberg or so 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.449
 We are also really cool 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.889
 many added and bibi blocksberg 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.270
 I have already done some 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.600
 I do that because they only have 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.030
 so 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.440
 main guest of 45 people and then 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.910
 I always do different things like that 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.370
 roll episodes and the last the 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.470
 skater came out 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:09.320
 bibi blocksberg and the little elf 8 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.660
 to 11 in front of the girls dream so totally 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.220
 also the first benjamin for me 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.020
 Blümchen follow that I have recorded 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.800
 I am completely disengaged once 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.800
 he stands before court 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.850
 So movie turns super 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.320
 sympathetic 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.820
 yes the guy is really nice and he is just 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.500
 big and so on again 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.710
 explain why he looks like that in mine 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.320
 eyes big and gray hair and to the bathroom 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.620
 and just so you know such a rock 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.620
 in the surf 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.160
 but that's what it means 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.240
 you can be in a good mood 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.980
 prepare and then behind 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.500
 You do not make a lot of microphones 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.800
 live or is it more often that too 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.530
 So you become what I do a lot 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.540
 readings and live radio plays and so white 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.630
 moderation not so regular and so 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.760
 most of it is actually in the dark 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.180
 behind the micro without me treats 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.820
 will 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.570
 do you mean you 'll be hung up? 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.820
 would lie strategy you down 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.450
 war, maybe I 'll drink before 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.670
 a beer maybe not a bad good one 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.250
 let's see how I mean it 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.130
 lampfieber is also part of this and only 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.630
 that's why it's still fun 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.380
 In that sense, I think that's going to happen 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.820
 be cool 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.720
 I'm sure I believe it will 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.340
 even during the half I feel 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.810
 looking forward to it and look forward to all 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.810
 Companies on the thirties great
