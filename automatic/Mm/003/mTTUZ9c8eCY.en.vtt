00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.360
 distribution would take two years and only 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.400
 it was a calculation but it was nothing 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.730
 wrong since officially diamond

 century fox has the rights of the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.380

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.660
 bend with the voices of dragon ball z 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.270

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.550
 probability then whatever they are 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.470

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.340
 Thank you 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.800
 first they still did not have the information 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.490
 clear then says it comes out this year 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.380
 let's hope so we said, that is, 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.780
 for the fuck but I hope and this is 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.360
 this is what I wanted to clarify 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.880
 they did not confirm anything just said that 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.190
 I expected it to be this year but as I already 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.320

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.660

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.180
 year and not yet announced if it will be in theaters 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.640

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.650
 final since the dates are subject to 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.300

 that will be released in japan in August not
