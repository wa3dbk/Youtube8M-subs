facing upwards push it through the hole

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.750 
facing upwards push it through the hole
there<00:00:27.000> should<00:00:27.900> fit<00:00:28.080> quite<00:00:28.230> slightly<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
there should fit quite slightly on the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.880 
there should fit quite slightly on the
other<00:00:29.939> side<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.390> should<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.619> come<00:00:31.740> out

a bit there with a gap then you're gonna
put<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> buckets<00:00:35.989> over<00:00:36.989> there<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.620> should

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
put the buckets over there it should

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.450 
put the buckets over there it should
just<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.430> easily<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.480> obviously<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:41.190> the

solder then you're gonna get the trigger

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.240 
solder then you're gonna get the trigger
block<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.289> you're<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.710> slide<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
block and you're gonna just slide it in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.619 
block and you're gonna just slide it in

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
next you're going to get the pins with

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.350 
next you're going to get the pins with
the<00:01:42.790> square<00:01:43.060> bases<00:01:43.480> and<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:45.610> should<00:01:46.150> fit

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
the square bases and they should fit

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.270 
the square bases and they should fit
quite<00:01:46.510> nicely<00:01:46.600> into<00:01:47.380> these<00:01:47.620> gaps<00:01:47.890> at<00:01:48.160> the

little bit sad but just grounded none of
us<00:02:58.739> get<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.860> other<00:02:59.890> two<00:03:00.250> tabs

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.470 

put<00:03:05.970> those<00:03:06.210> on<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.630> ends<00:03:08.300> okay<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:10.490> now<00:03:11.490> you've

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
put those on the ends okay so now you've

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.850 
put those on the ends okay so now you've
almost<00:03:13.050> finished<00:03:13.940> now<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:15.150> make<00:03:15.300> sure<00:03:15.510> that

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
almost finished now just make sure that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.410 
almost finished now just make sure that
when<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.430> push<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.820> trigger<00:03:17.910> forward

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
when you you push the trigger forward

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.440 
when you you push the trigger forward
that<00:03:19.020> this<00:03:19.200> can<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.830> freely<00:03:20.150> flow<00:03:21.150> back<00:03:21.420> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
that this can can freely flow back and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.680 
that this can can freely flow back and
forth<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.650> hitting<00:03:22.980> over<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.690> you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
forth if it's hitting over there you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.290 
forth if it's hitting over there you
probably<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.380> need<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:26.310> grind<00:03:26.580> down<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
probably just need to to grind down the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.910 
probably just need to to grind down the
Stricker<00:03:27.570> tab<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> little<00:03:28.200> bit<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.770> go

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
Stricker tab a little bit so it can go

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.010 
Stricker tab a little bit so it can go
pop<00:03:29.160> freely<00:03:30.830> okay<00:03:31.830> next<00:03:32.610> up<00:03:32.850> are<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.660> elastic
