00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.179 

animations<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.379> up<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.890> whether

you<00:02:20.310> want<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.609> have<00:02:20.700> an<00:02:20.819> animation<00:02:21.739> you<00:02:22.739> can

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
you want to have an animation you can

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.069 
you want to have an animation you can
remove<00:02:23.219> it<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.519> change<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:25.640> okay<00:02:26.719> so<00:02:27.719> you<00:02:27.780> could

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
remove it or change it okay so you could

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.589 
remove it or change it okay so you could
already<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:29.040> slide<00:02:29.400> transition<00:02:30.120> or

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
already have just a slide transition or

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.789 
already have just a slide transition or
the<00:02:31.439> custom<00:02:31.970> animation<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.659> I<00:02:33.959> suggest<00:02:34.439> one<00:02:34.769> of

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
the custom animation so I suggest one of

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.399 
the custom animation so I suggest one of
the<00:02:35.040> other<00:02:35.480> okay<00:02:36.480> because<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.019> makes<00:02:37.230> it

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
the other okay because it just makes it

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.559 
the other okay because it just makes it
too<00:02:37.590> complicated<00:02:37.879> now<00:02:38.879> if<00:02:39.060> you're<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.420> to

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
too complicated now if you're going to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.080 
too complicated now if you're going to
do<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.319> custom<00:02:40.739> animations<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.730> would<00:02:41.879> have

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
do the custom animations you would have

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.979 
do the custom animations you would have
no<00:02:42.769> transition<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.639> would<00:02:44.849> still<00:02:45.030> make

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
no transition and you would still make

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.809 
no transition and you would still make
sure<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.620> got<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.859> slide<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.579> 30

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
sure that you got the slide for 30

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.690 
sure that you got the slide for 30
seconds<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:49.139> first<00:02:49.409> one<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.769> have<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.159> only

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
23 seconds forcing just depends on the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.349 
23 seconds forcing just depends on the
how<00:02:53.280> how<00:02:54.180> long<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.689> actual<00:02:55.159> words<00:02:56.159> are<00:02:58.340> now

or you can save it as a PowerPoint so if
you<00:04:18.120> say<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.539> it's<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.780> PowerPoint<00:04:19.380> might<00:04:19.709> be

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
you say that it's a PowerPoint might be

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.499 
you say that it's a PowerPoint might be
a<00:04:19.949> bit<00:04:20.130> easier<00:04:20.159> depends<00:04:20.880> how<00:04:21.060> strong<00:04:21.389> your

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
a bit easier depends how strong your

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.080 
a bit easier depends how strong your
computer<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.229> how<00:04:22.860> much<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.460> drawers<00:04:23.729> out<00:04:24.060> of

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
computer is how much the drawers out of

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.070 
computer is how much the drawers out of
it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.950 
it
so<00:04:26.080> that's<00:04:26.470> basically<00:04:26.680> how<00:04:27.070> you<00:04:27.310> export<00:04:28.240> one

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
so that's basically how you export one

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.610 
so that's basically how you export one
slide<00:04:29.470> at<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.770> time<00:04:30.180> or<00:04:31.180> as<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.960> said<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.350> can<00:04:32.380> do

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
slide at a time or as I said you can do

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.200 
slide at a time or as I said you can do
it<00:04:32.740> by<00:04:32.890> slideshow<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:35.100> okay<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.640> now<00:04:37.000> we're

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
it by slideshow and okay so now we're

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.900 
it by slideshow and okay so now we're
going<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.570> create<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.230> next<00:04:38.410> video<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.190> the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
going to create the next video and the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.270 
going to create the next video and the
next<00:04:40.120> video<00:04:40.390> is<00:04:40.660> going<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.020> be<00:04:41.110> on<00:04:41.350> windows

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
next video is going to be on windows

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.180 
next video is going to be on windows
movie<00:04:42.580> maker

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.250 

you
