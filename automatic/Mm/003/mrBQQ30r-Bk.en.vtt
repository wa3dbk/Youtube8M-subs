00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
home in the Train strain on some speed

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.360 
home in the Train strain on some speed
like<00:05:15.750> it<00:05:15.900> accelerates<00:05:16.349> really<00:05:16.650> quickly<00:05:17.190> how

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
like it accelerates really quickly how

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.040 
like it accelerates really quickly how
fast<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.699> tetra<00:05:17.970> fifty<00:05:18.270> but<00:05:18.449> we<00:05:18.539> slowed<00:05:18.870> down

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
fast can tetra fifty but we slowed down

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.010 
fast can tetra fifty but we slowed down
for<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.289> corners<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:20.039> you<00:05:20.130> don't<00:05:20.280> derail

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
for the corners so you don't derail

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.120 
for the corners so you don't derail
ostrich<00:05:22.020> it's<00:05:22.680> beamed<00:05:24.319> all<00:05:25.319> the<00:05:25.530> way<00:05:25.650> home<00:05:25.889> I

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
ostrich it's beamed all the way home I

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.740
