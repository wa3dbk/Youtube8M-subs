00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.409 

so<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.190> my<00:00:02.280> last<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:02.790> I<00:00:02.850> talked<00:00:03.149> about<00:00:03.240> how

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
so in my last video I talked about how

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.289 
so in my last video I talked about how
you<00:00:03.629> can<00:00:03.870> generate<00:00:04.049> coastlines<00:00:04.799> by<00:00:05.460> putting

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
you can generate coastlines by putting

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.179 
you can generate coastlines by putting
lots<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.600> small<00:00:06.870> cubes<00:00:07.230> or<00:00:07.410> small<00:00:07.589> objects<00:00:08.010> and

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
lots of small cubes or small objects and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.650 
lots of small cubes or small objects and
then<00:00:08.280> shifting<00:00:08.639> them<00:00:08.730> around<00:00:08.910> until<00:00:09.269> you

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
then shifting them around until you

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
then shifting them around until you
found<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.990> shape<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.380> liked<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.980> speed

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
found a shape that you liked to speed

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.370 
found a shape that you liked to speed
things<00:00:11.340> up<00:00:11.519> another<00:00:12.509> way<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.200> is

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
things up another way you can do this is

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.680 
things up another way you can do this is
to<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> purely<00:00:14.429> randomly<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.509> can

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to do this purely randomly this can

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840 
to do this purely randomly this can
generate<00:00:15.900> some<00:00:16.080> interesting<00:00:16.410> shapes<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
generate some interesting shapes and the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.609 
generate some interesting shapes and the
way<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.900> again<00:00:19.529> you

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
way that you can do this is again you

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.900 
way that you can do this is again you
use<00:00:19.830> small<00:00:20.699> pieces<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.439> this<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.910> instead

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
use small pieces like this and instead

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.189 
use small pieces like this and instead
of<00:00:24.090> putting<00:00:24.510> them<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> board<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
of putting them on the board and

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.050 
of putting them on the board and
shifting<00:00:25.529> them<00:00:25.619> around<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:26.460> drop<00:00:26.789> them

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
shifting them around you just drop them

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.150 
shifting them around you just drop them
from<00:00:27.810> fairly<00:00:28.380> low<00:00:28.500> Heights<00:00:28.769> they<00:00:29.010> don't

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
from fairly low Heights they don't

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
from fairly low Heights they don't
bounce<00:00:29.250> too<00:00:29.519> far<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.510> leave<00:00:30.750> them

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
bounce too far and you leave them

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
bounce too far and you leave them
exactly<00:00:31.170> where<00:00:31.439> they<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:32.030> and<00:00:33.030> try<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
exactly where they are and try not to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.819 
exactly where they are and try not to
move<00:00:33.540> them<00:00:33.690> around<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:34.620> much

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
move them around at all or very much

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
move them around at all or very much
this<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.790> generate<00:00:36.390> interesting<00:00:36.870> shapes

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
this will generate interesting shapes

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.580 
this will generate interesting shapes
and<00:00:37.710> coastlines<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.969> use<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> let's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and coastlines that you can use so let's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.190 
and coastlines that you can use so let's
try<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> see<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.550> happens<00:00:41.850> again<00:00:42.690> I'm<00:00:42.870> only<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
try to see what happens again I'm only a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
try to see what happens again I'm only a
couple<00:00:43.320> inches<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> top<00:00:44.250> I'm<00:00:44.730> dumping

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
couple inches off the top I'm dumping

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.180 
couple inches off the top I'm dumping
them<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.539> into<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> middle<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> time

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.130 

going<00:00:53.190> ones<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.090> fall<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> page<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.960> just

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
going ones that fall off the page I just

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
going ones that fall off the page I just
reuse<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.739> try<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> dump<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.850> near<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
reuse I try to dump them all near the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.729 
reuse I try to dump them all near the
middle<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.410> makes<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> more

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
middle because that makes it more

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.640 
middle because that makes it more
centralized<00:01:00.230> shape<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> cubes<00:01:06.260> alright<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
centralized shape of cubes alright so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
centralized shape of cubes alright so
off<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> page

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.690 

you<00:01:15.480> more

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.170 

all<00:01:25.180> right<00:01:25.330> let's<00:01:25.479> see<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.720> have<00:01:25.869> here

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.890 

again<00:01:29.960> you're<00:01:30.140> not<00:01:30.290> completely<00:01:31.510> trapped<00:01:32.510> by

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
again you're not completely trapped by

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.790 
again you're not completely trapped by
where<00:01:33.080> these<00:01:33.260> things<00:01:33.440> are<00:01:36.910> you<00:01:37.910> can<00:01:38.090> use<00:01:38.300> your

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
where these things are you can use your

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.470 
where these things are you can use your
best<00:01:39.800> judgment<00:01:40.490> about<00:01:40.610> how<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.000> work<00:01:41.300> around

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
best judgment about how to work around

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:53.030 
best judgment about how to work around
them

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.950 

now<00:01:53.580> in<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.820> opinion<00:01:53.940> with<00:01:54.300> this<00:01:54.450> does<00:01:54.690> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
now in my opinion with this does this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
now in my opinion with this does this
creates<00:01:55.350> usually<00:01:56.280> pretty<00:01:56.490> interestingly

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
creates usually pretty interestingly

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.990 
creates usually pretty interestingly
shaped<00:01:58.190> continents<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.370> land<00:01:59.940> masses

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.640 

there<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.120> programs<00:02:06.660> online<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.410> will<00:02:07.500> do

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
there are programs online that will do

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.870 
there are programs online that will do
this<00:02:07.830> digitally<00:02:09.619> create<00:02:10.619> digital<00:02:10.880> random

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
this digitally create digital random

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.660 
this digitally create digital random
shapes<00:02:12.350> but<00:02:13.350> oftentimes<00:02:13.950> these<00:02:14.160> can<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.460> too

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
shapes but oftentimes these can be too

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.050 
shapes but oftentimes these can be too
random<00:02:15.030> because<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.110> isn't<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:17.060> there

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
random because there isn't like a there

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.050 
random because there isn't like a there
isn't<00:02:18.210> like<00:02:18.240> an<00:02:18.420> analog<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.370> know<00:02:20.370> system

behind them that's sort of limiting the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.440 
behind them that's sort of limiting the
shapes<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.390> be

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
shapes that they have that just can be

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.960 
shapes that they have that just can be
kind<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.660> noisy<00:02:25.370> although<00:02:26.370> there's<00:02:26.550> exception

kind of noisy although there's exception

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.020 
kind of noisy although there's exception
to<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:31.370> doing<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.610> way<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.850> think

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
to this but doing it this way I think

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.760 
to this but doing it this way I think
and<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:33.480> using<00:02:33.750> your<00:02:33.780> judgement<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:34.470> how

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
and then using your judgement about how

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.240 
and then using your judgement about how
to<00:02:34.830> apply<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.960> end<00:02:37.170> up<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.350> some

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
to apply it you can end up with some

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.880 
to apply it you can end up with some
very<00:02:38.280> interesting<00:02:38.550> shapes<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.650> ones<00:02:40.650> that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
very interesting shapes and ones that

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.650 
very interesting shapes and ones that
often<00:02:41.390> look<00:02:42.390> very<00:02:43.580> plausible<00:02:44.580> which<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.540> what

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
often look very plausible which is what

00:02:45.660 --> 00:03:06.200 
often look very plausible which is what
you<00:02:45.750> want

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.090 

there<00:03:07.210> we<00:03:07.330> have<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.960> think<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.860> fairly

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
there we have I think the fairly

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.340 
there we have I think the fairly
interesting<00:03:09.280> shape<00:03:09.640> continent<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.990> seem<00:03:11.230> out

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
interesting shape continent you seem out

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.800 
interesting shape continent you seem out
a<00:03:11.410> little<00:03:11.560> bit

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.380 

okay

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
okay

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.500 
okay
now<00:03:20.960> you<00:03:21.050> can<00:03:21.610> do<00:03:22.610> this<00:03:22.820> as<00:03:23.000> many<00:03:23.090> times<00:03:23.210> as<00:03:23.420> you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
now you can do this as many times as you

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.750 
now you can do this as many times as you
want<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:24.020> do<00:03:24.140> this<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.650> add<00:03:24.890> on<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.700> know

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
want you can do this and add on you know

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.450 
want you can do this and add on you know
we<00:03:26.570> add<00:03:26.960> on<00:03:27.170> some<00:03:27.350> random<00:03:27.650> shapes<00:03:27.920> nearby

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
we add on some random shapes nearby

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.550 
we add on some random shapes nearby
let<00:03:28.640> us<00:03:28.730> work<00:03:28.910> as<00:03:29.060> well<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.350> especially

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
let us work as well this is especially

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.810 
let us work as well this is especially
effective<00:03:31.220> when<00:03:31.250> you're<00:03:31.430> making<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.730> very

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
effective when you're making a very

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.660 
effective when you're making a very
large<00:03:32.120> map<00:03:32.420> using<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.930> poster<00:03:33.320> size<00:03:33.620> board<00:03:34.010> both

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
large map using a poster size board both

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.400 
large map using a poster size board both
of<00:03:34.820> these<00:03:34.940> techniques<00:03:35.270> are<00:03:35.480> dropping<00:03:35.780> or<00:03:36.200> just

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
of these techniques are dropping or just

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.860 
of these techniques are dropping or just
scattering<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:36.950> moving<00:03:37.220> them<00:03:37.340> around<00:03:37.870> if

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
scattering and moving them around if

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.690 
scattering and moving them around if
it's<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.110> very<00:03:39.290> large<00:03:39.500> map<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.010> can<00:03:40.040> bezel

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
it's a very large map and you can bezel

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.850 
it's a very large map and you can bezel
add<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:40.880> lot<00:03:41.090> more<00:03:41.120> detail<00:03:41.630> if<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.530> smaller

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
add a lot more detail if it's a smaller

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.280 
add a lot more detail if it's a smaller
map<00:03:43.130> then<00:03:43.460> they<00:03:43.610> will<00:03:43.760> be<00:03:43.910> chunkier<00:03:44.750> obviously

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
map then they will be chunkier obviously

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.670 
map then they will be chunkier obviously
they<00:03:45.500> will<00:03:45.650> represent<00:03:46.430> larger<00:03:46.850> areas<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.270> land

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
they will represent larger areas of land

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.490 
they will represent larger areas of land
either<00:03:48.680> technique<00:03:49.100> might<00:03:49.250> work<00:03:50.440> all<00:03:51.440> right

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
either technique might work all right

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.770 
either technique might work all right
