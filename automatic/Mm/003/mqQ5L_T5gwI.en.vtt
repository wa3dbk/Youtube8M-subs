00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
about how to use a metronome so we're

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.640 
about how to use a metronome so we're
gonna<00:00:10.820> use<00:00:11.360> our<00:00:11.570> metronome<00:00:11.930> throughout<00:00:12.440> our

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
gonna use our metronome throughout our

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.620 
gonna use our metronome throughout our
guitar<00:00:13.070> training<00:00:13.519> so<00:00:13.700> it's<00:00:13.940> a<00:00:14.060> good<00:00:14.180> time<00:00:14.450> now

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
guitar training so it's a good time now

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.689 
guitar training so it's a good time now
to<00:00:14.690> take<00:00:14.960> a<00:00:15.019> look<00:00:15.110> at<00:00:15.500> our<00:00:15.920> actual<00:00:16.279> metronome

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
to take a look at our actual metronome

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.339 
to take a look at our actual metronome
and<00:00:16.789> see<00:00:16.939> how<00:00:17.119> it<00:00:17.210> works<00:00:17.420> so<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.019> can<00:00:18.170> grab<00:00:18.320> my

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
and see how it works so I can grab my

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.839 
and see how it works so I can grab my
metronome<00:00:18.800> which<00:00:19.039> is<00:00:19.159> sitting<00:00:19.400> on<00:00:19.490> my<00:00:19.609> desk

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
metronome which is sitting on my desk

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.499 
metronome which is sitting on my desk
right<00:00:20.210> here<00:00:21.609> now<00:00:22.609> depending<00:00:22.999> on<00:00:23.119> what<00:00:23.300> style

right here now depending on what style

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:24.970 
right here now depending on what style
of<00:00:23.689> metronome<00:00:24.109> you<00:00:24.140> get<00:00:24.409> they<00:00:24.619> might<00:00:24.769> have

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
of metronome you get they might have

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.529 
of metronome you get they might have
different<00:00:25.189> buttons<00:00:25.460> different<00:00:26.089> functions

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
different buttons different functions

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.559

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
for it to have a number which will tell

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.330 
for it to have a number which will tell
you<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.669> tempo<00:00:32.270> of<00:00:32.660> how<00:00:33.590> quick<00:00:34.130> you're

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
you the tempo of how quick you're

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.540 
you the tempo of how quick you're
playing<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.000> it<00:00:35.960> should<00:00:36.170> be<00:00:36.350> very<00:00:37.809> simple

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
playing and it should be very simple

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.250 
playing and it should be very simple
beep-beep-beep<00:00:40.760> now<00:00:41.000> metronomes<00:00:41.690> are<00:00:41.840> great

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
beep-beep-beep now metronomes are great

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.669 
beep-beep-beep now metronomes are great
because<00:00:43.160> as<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:44.000> can<00:00:44.090> tell<00:00:44.359> this<00:00:44.870> beats<00:00:45.350> at<00:00:45.620> a

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
because as you can tell this beats at a

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.490 
because as you can tell this beats at a
consistent<00:00:46.609> time<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:48.170> when<00:00:48.379> you're

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
consistent time so when you're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.160 
consistent time so when you're
practicing<00:00:48.769> say<00:00:49.399> you're<00:00:49.550> practicing<00:00:50.210> your

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
practicing say you're practicing your

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.829

use<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:23.980> metronome<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.670> track<00:02:24.970> your<00:02:25.150> progress

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390

use the metronome to track your progress
because<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.049> next<00:02:26.290> week<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.099> are<00:02:27.310> making

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
because the next week if you are making

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.539 
because the next week if you are making
progress<00:02:27.909> your<00:02:28.599> speech<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.049> be<00:02:29.140> quicker<00:02:29.549> and

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
progress your speech to be quicker and

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.130 
progress your speech to be quicker and
every<00:02:30.760> week<00:02:30.939> you<00:02:31.060> should<00:02:31.150> be<00:02:31.239> trying<00:02:31.689> to<00:02:31.900> get

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140

that number higher and higher and higher

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.809 
that number higher and higher and higher
every<00:02:34.659> week<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.890> metronomes<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.489> really

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
every week so metronomes are really

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.949 
every week so metronomes are really
great<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.150> work<00:02:37.239> with<00:02:37.299> if<00:02:37.569> you're<00:02:37.689> doing<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
great to work with if you're doing the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.890 
great to work with if you're doing the
chord<00:02:38.200> changes<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> hundred<00:02:40.510> beats

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
chord changes this is a hundred beats

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.330 
chord changes this is a hundred beats
per<00:02:41.079> minute<00:02:41.349> but<00:02:41.470> if<00:02:41.560> I'm<00:02:41.680> gonna<00:02:41.890> try<00:02:42.129> and<00:02:42.189> do<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
per minute but if I'm gonna try and do a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.569 
per minute but if I'm gonna try and do a
chord<00:02:42.700> change<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.480> gonna<00:02:43.599> just<00:02:43.840> do<00:02:44.019> an<00:02:44.290> G<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.950> G

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
chord change I'm gonna just do an G a G

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:58.229 
chord change I'm gonna just do an G a G
a<00:02:46.180> G<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:56.290> helps<00:02:56.680> me<00:02:56.799> keep<00:02:57.040> whatever<00:02:57.909> I'm

impendence exercise one you know forty
beats<00:03:27.699> per<00:03:28.000> minute<00:03:28.269> then<00:03:28.720> next<00:03:28.959> week<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.349> might

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
beats per minute then next week it might

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.020 
beats per minute then next week it might
be<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.709> fifty<00:03:30.069> beats<00:03:30.280> per<00:03:30.459> minute<00:03:30.699> so<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.879> can

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
be a fifty beats per minute so you can

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.479 
be a fifty beats per minute so you can
see<00:03:31.480> from<00:03:31.900> week<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.260> week<00:03:32.290> your<00:03:32.680> own<00:03:32.829> personal

see from week to week your own personal

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.270 
see from week to week your own personal
progress<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.659> using<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.139> metronome<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.769> great

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
progress so using a metronome is great

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.759 
progress so using a metronome is great
especially<00:03:37.060> if<00:03:37.480> you're<00:03:37.840> learning<00:03:38.260> some<00:03:38.470> kind

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
especially if you're learning some kind

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.520 
especially if you're learning some kind
of<00:03:39.010> lick<00:03:39.879> or<00:03:40.060> something<00:03:40.480> you'll<00:03:41.049> want<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.379> do

of lick or something you'll want to do

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.899 
of lick or something you'll want to do
it<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.769> time<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.250> don't<00:03:42.370> want<00:03:42.609> to<00:03:42.699> rush

something or have the timing off so

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.550 
something or have the timing off so
metronomes<00:03:45.220> are<00:03:45.340> great<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.840> use<00:03:47.049> right<00:03:47.379> from

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
metronomes are great to use right from

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.559 
metronomes are great to use right from
the<00:03:47.620> beginning<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:48.159> really<00:03:49.090> promote<00:03:49.389> using

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
the beginning I really promote using

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.879 
the beginning I really promote using
them<00:03:49.780> right<00:03:49.810> at<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.079> beginning<00:03:50.169> so<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:50.739> you

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
them right at the beginning so that you

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.460 
them right at the beginning so that you
can<00:03:51.010> develop<00:03:51.190> your<00:03:51.400> own<00:03:51.609> time<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.329> rhythm<00:03:52.900> and

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
can develop your own time and rhythm and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.770 
can develop your own time and rhythm and
will<00:03:54.159> use<00:03:54.310> them<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.609> lot<00:03:54.729> throughout<00:03:55.599> the
