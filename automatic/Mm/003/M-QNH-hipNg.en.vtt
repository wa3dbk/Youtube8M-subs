video<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.500> while<00:00:22.710> ago<00:00:22.770> but<00:00:23.040> I<00:00:23.250> wasn't<00:00:23.490> too<00:00:23.880> sure

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
video a while ago but I wasn't too sure

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.480 
video a while ago but I wasn't too sure
if<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.360> was<00:00:24.509> intended<00:00:25.020> or<00:00:25.349> not<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:25.830> after

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
if this was intended or not but after

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.490 
if this was intended or not but after
talking<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.090> people<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.630> fact<00:00:28.020> it<00:00:28.200> does

talking to some people in fact it does
seem<00:00:28.859> like<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.100> bug<00:00:29.460> before<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.330> demonstrate

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
seem like a bug before I demonstrate

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
seem like a bug before I demonstrate
basically<00:00:31.439> there's<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.740> problem<00:00:32.010> with

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
basically there's a problem with

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.400 
basically there's a problem with
allergies<00:00:32.879> where<00:00:33.269> if<00:00:33.449> you<00:00:33.570> aim<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.110> site

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
allergies where if you aim the on site

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.890 
allergies where if you aim the on site
and<00:00:34.710> shoot<00:00:35.040> too<00:00:35.370> quick<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.300> spread<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> your

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
and shoot too quick the spread of your

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.320 
and shoot too quick the spread of your
bolts<00:00:37.170> will<00:00:37.379> be<00:00:37.470> extremely<00:00:38.150> deviated<00:00:39.150> when

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
bolts will be extremely deviated when

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.240 
bolts will be extremely deviated when
comparing<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.290> wait<00:00:40.500> very<00:00:40.860> slightly

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
comparing to if you wait very slightly

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
comparing to if you wait very slightly
before<00:00:41.610> shooting<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.080> to<00:00:43.230> show<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.410> this

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
before shooting I'm not to show up this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
before shooting I'm not to show up this
problem<00:00:43.980> started<00:00:44.400> with<00:00:44.549> the<00:00:44.760> spring<00:00:45.150> patch

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
problem started with the spring patch

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.960 
problem started with the spring patch
but<00:00:45.839> it's<00:00:45.989> recently<00:00:46.559> been<00:00:46.799> reported<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.430> CTA

but it's recently been reported on CTA

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.000 
but it's recently been reported on CTA
quite<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:48.479> few<00:00:48.809> times<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.860> demonstrate

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
quite a few times and to demonstrate

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.399 
quite a few times and to demonstrate
this<00:00:50.460> problem<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.030> anyone<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.510> has<00:00:51.870> no<00:00:52.049> idea

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
this problem for anyone that has no idea

this problem for anyone that has no idea
what<00:00:52.589> I'm<00:00:52.680> talking<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.129> I'm<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:54.089> to<00:00:54.210> aim

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
what I'm talking about I'm going to aim

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.329 
what I'm talking about I'm going to aim
down<00:00:54.540> sight<00:00:54.900> with<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:55.170> mg<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.799> but<00:00:56.010> I'll<00:00:56.129> wait

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
down sight with the mg for but I'll wait

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.609 
down sight with the mg for but I'll wait
very<00:00:56.760> slightly<00:00:57.299> before<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.780> actually<00:00:58.049> shoot

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
very slightly before I actually shoot

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.740 
very slightly before I actually shoot
and<00:00:58.979> as<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.580> see<00:00:59.729> this<00:00:59.909> spread<00:01:00.299> grouping

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and as we can see this spread grouping

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
and as we can see this spread grouping
is<00:01:00.900> fairly<00:01:01.320> tight<00:01:01.739> however<00:01:02.309> let's<00:01:02.610> see<00:01:03.299> what

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
is fairly tight however let's see what

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.539 
is fairly tight however let's see what
happens<00:01:03.900> if<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.199> shoot<00:01:04.500> immediately<00:01:04.680> right

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
happens if I shoot immediately right

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
happens if I shoot immediately right
Arthur<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.030> aimed<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.600> on-site<00:01:07.020> you'll<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.100> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
Arthur I aimed the on-site you'll see in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
Arthur I aimed the on-site you'll see in
the<00:01:08.400> next<00:01:08.580> few<00:01:08.850> groupings<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> spread

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the next few groupings that the spread

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.830 
the next few groupings that the spread
is<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> lot<00:01:10.770> wider<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.490> seems<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.270> LMGs

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is a lot wider and it seems like as LMGs

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.050 
is a lot wider and it seems like as LMGs
have<00:01:13.049> pretty<00:01:13.350> bad<00:01:13.650> hip<00:01:13.950> fire<00:01:14.189> spread<00:01:14.220> I'm

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
have pretty bad hip fire spread I'm

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.640 
have pretty bad hip fire spread I'm
wondering<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> hipfire<00:01:16.410> spread

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
wondering if some of the hipfire spread

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
wondering if some of the hipfire spread
values<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.640> still<00:01:17.940> being<00:01:18.150> applied<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:18.750> your

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
values are still being applied to your

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
values are still being applied to your
aiming<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.500> sights<00:01:19.620> spread<00:01:20.400> which<00:01:20.910> like<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
aiming down sights spread which like I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.670 
aiming down sights spread which like I
said<00:01:21.270> before<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:21.870> not<00:01:22.020> too<00:01:22.200> sure<00:01:22.410> if<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:22.620> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
said before I'm not too sure if this is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.190 
said before I'm not too sure if this is
intended<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> people<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.960> have

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
intended or not but the people that have

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
intended or not but the people that have
been<00:01:25.230> reporting<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:25.980> issue<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.580> been<00:01:26.760> told

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
been reporting this issue have been told

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.240 
been reporting this issue have been told
to<00:01:27.270> add<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.810> BF<00:01:28.110> tracker<00:01:28.440> website<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to add it to the BF tracker website that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100 
to add it to the BF tracker website that
tracks<00:01:29.430> all<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> bugs<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.390> game<00:01:30.600> which

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
tracks all the bugs in the game which

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.500 
tracks all the bugs in the game which
tells<00:01:31.380> me<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.680> mechanic<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:32.850> intended

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
tells me this mechanic is not intended

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.200 
tells me this mechanic is not intended
at<00:01:33.690> all<00:01:33.980> let's<00:01:34.980> take<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.190> step<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.730> this<00:01:35.940> time

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
at all let's take a step back this time

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
at all let's take a step back this time
so<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.200> distance<00:01:37.500> I'm

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so there's a little more distance I'm

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
so there's a little more distance I'm
going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.730> fight<00:01:38.970> through<00:01:39.180> groupings<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
going to fight through groupings with a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.290 
going to fight through groupings with a
slides<00:01:40.530> later<00:01:40.830> if<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.430> shoot<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.180> as

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
slides later if I actually shoot and as

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.090 
slides later if I actually shoot and as
you<00:01:42.480> can<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.560> last<00:01:43.770> time<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you can see just like last time the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.850 
you can see just like last time the
spread<00:01:44.550> is<00:01:44.700> relatively<00:01:45.270> grouped<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.260> then

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
spread is relatively grouped up and then

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.890 
spread is relatively grouped up and then
I'll<00:01:47.040> shoot<00:01:47.280> another<00:01:47.610> two<00:01:48.030> groupings<00:01:48.540> but

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
I'll shoot another two groupings but

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.930 
I'll shoot another two groupings but
this<00:01:49.110> time<00:01:49.350> I'll<00:01:49.560> shoot<00:01:49.800> straight<00:01:50.370> after<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
this time I'll shoot straight after a

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.240 
this time I'll shoot straight after a
Mindy<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.360> site<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.770> before<00:01:52.980> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
Mindy on site and just like before the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
Mindy on site and just like before the
spread<00:01:53.550> as<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:53.880> take<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.330> closer<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.870> is<00:01:55.229> much

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
spread as I take a closer look is much

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.070 
spread as I take a closer look is much
much<00:01:56.100> wider<00:01:56.460> which<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.120> not<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> good<00:01:57.840> thing<00:01:57.900> to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
much wider which is not a good thing to

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.530 
much wider which is not a good thing to
happen<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.650> all<00:01:58.800> especially<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.970> those<00:02:00.090> heated

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.469 
happen at all especially in those heated
gunfights<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.610> about<00:02:02.700> other<00:02:03.000> belt-fed

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
gunfights so what about other belt-fed

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.660 
gunfights so what about other belt-fed
LMGs<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.710> using<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.190> owl<00:02:05.340> stop

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
LMGs this time I'm using the owl stop

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
LMGs this time I'm using the owl stop
which<00:02:05.909> has<00:02:06.120> slightly<00:02:06.450> improved<00:02:06.990> hip<00:02:07.260> five

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
which has slightly improved hip five

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
which has slightly improved hip five
starts<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.159> mg<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.759> I'll<00:02:09.239> shoot<00:02:09.509> two

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
starts to the mg for I'll shoot two

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.660 
starts to the mg for I'll shoot two
groupings<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.409> a<00:02:10.440> delay<00:02:10.799> first<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.519> we

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
groupings with a delay first and as we

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
groupings with a delay first and as we
can<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> spread<00:02:12.659> is<00:02:12.810> fairly<00:02:13.230> tight

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
can see the spread is fairly tight

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
can see the spread is fairly tight
however<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.700> shoot<00:02:14.940> without<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.360> delay<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
however if I shoot without a delay the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.740 
however if I shoot without a delay the
spread<00:02:16.319> becomes<00:02:16.769> extremely<00:02:17.400> wild<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.510> can

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
spread becomes extremely wild as you can

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.930 
spread becomes extremely wild as you can
see<00:02:18.959> which<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.590> really<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.250> good<00:02:20.430> thing<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
see which is really not a good thing and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.790 
see which is really not a good thing and
even<00:02:21.480> looks<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.780> little<00:02:21.930> bit<00:02:22.080> worse<00:02:22.350> than<00:02:22.709> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
even looks a little bit worse than the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.760 
even looks a little bit worse than the
mg<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.390> compare<00:02:24.750> still<00:02:25.200> image<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
mg for if we compare still image of the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.309 
mg for if we compare still image of the
ulcer

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
ulcer

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.170 
ulcer
opens<00:02:26.650> I'm<00:02:26.859> thinking<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.549> difference<00:02:27.999> is

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
opens I'm thinking the difference is

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.449 
opens I'm thinking the difference is
pretty<00:02:28.540> huge<00:02:28.900> because<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.469> outside<00:02:29.920> has<00:02:30.129> very

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
pretty huge because the outside has very

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.729 
pretty huge because the outside has very
little<00:02:30.670> recoil<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.420> spread<00:02:32.200> increase<00:02:32.319> per

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
little recoil and spread increase per

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.550 
little recoil and spread increase per
shot<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.040> lower<00:02:33.489> than<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:33.969> mg<00:02:34.329> Falls<00:02:34.689> so<00:02:35.379> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
shot is lower than the mg Falls so the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.280 
shot is lower than the mg Falls so the
aiming<00:02:35.859> down<00:02:35.980> slides<00:02:36.969> with<00:02:37.389> a<00:02:37.420> delay<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
left side Argos be pretty tight but if

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080 
left side Argos be pretty tight but if
we<00:02:41.319> take<00:02:41.499> a<00:02:41.560> look<00:02:41.799> on<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> right<00:02:42.189> side<00:02:42.489> with<00:02:42.760> no

we take a look on the right side with no
delay<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.629> groupings<00:02:44.109> are<00:02:44.230> huge<00:02:44.829> which<00:02:45.099> tells

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
delay the groupings are huge which tells

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.119 
delay the groupings are huge which tells
me<00:02:45.639> two<00:02:46.060> different<00:02:46.269> theories<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.620> first<00:02:47.889> one

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
me two different theories the first one

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.129 
me two different theories the first one
is<00:02:48.159> if<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.700> aim<00:02:48.879> the<00:02:48.909> outside<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.780> shoot

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
is if you aim the outside and shoot

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.569 
is if you aim the outside and shoot
through<00:02:50.379> quickly<00:02:50.680> you'll<00:02:50.980> get<00:02:51.129> hit<00:02:51.370> with<00:02:51.549> a

through quickly you'll get hit with a

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.149 
through quickly you'll get hit with a

the issue isn't as bad because the

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
bit less than that belt-fed LMGs but

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.830 
bit less than that belt-fed LMGs but
what<00:03:33.250> about<00:03:33.459> other<00:03:33.669> weapons<00:03:34.180> does<00:03:34.479> it<00:03:34.599> happen

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
what about other weapons does it happen

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.619 
what about other weapons does it happen
on<00:03:35.139> carbines<00:03:35.769> or<00:03:36.009> assault<00:03:36.370> rifles<00:03:36.849> well<00:03:37.419> if<00:03:37.509> we

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
on carbines or assault rifles well if we

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.409 
on carbines or assault rifles well if we
take<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.870> look<00:03:38.019> at<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.379> AK<00:03:38.859> 5<00:03:39.220> CEO<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.879> did<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> few

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
take a look at the AK 5 CEO I did a few

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.360 
take a look at the AK 5 CEO I did a few
tests<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.959> yes<00:03:41.199> it<00:03:41.590> does<00:03:41.799> seem<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.220> happen

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
tests and yes it does seem to happen

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.689 
tests and yes it does seem to happen
very<00:03:42.939> very<00:03:43.120> slightly<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.169> it's<00:03:44.319> absolutely

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
very very slightly but it's absolutely

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.939 
very very slightly but it's absolutely
nowhere<00:03:45.699> near<00:03:45.970> as<00:03:46.090> bad<00:03:46.269> as<00:03:46.479> the<00:03:46.599> LMGs<00:03:47.139> if<00:03:47.799> I

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
nowhere near as bad as the LMGs if I

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.219 
nowhere near as bad as the LMGs if I
take<00:03:48.189> a<00:03:48.220> still<00:03:48.549> image<00:03:48.579> from<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.030> AK<00:03:49.449> 5c<00:03:50.049> the

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
take a still image from the AK 5c the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.140 
take a still image from the AK 5c the
left<00:03:50.500> side<00:03:50.709> has<00:03:50.949> a<00:03:50.979> delay<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.790> groupings

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
left side has a delay so the groupings

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.030 
left side has a delay so the groupings
are<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.329> little<00:03:52.629> tighter<00:03:52.989> compared<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.859> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
are a little tighter compared to the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.670 
are a little tighter compared to the
right<00:03:54.250> side<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.759> has<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> no<00:03:55.479> delay<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:56.530> I

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
right side that has a no delay like I

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.379 
right side that has a no delay like I
said<00:03:56.739> it<00:03:57.009> seems<00:03:57.250> like<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.609> issue<00:03:57.759> is<00:03:58.060> very

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
said it seems like the issue is very

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.719 
said it seems like the issue is very
very<00:03:58.930> slightly<00:03:59.439> present<00:04:00.040> on<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:00.220> carbines

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
very slightly present on the carbines

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.999 
very slightly present on the carbines
and<00:04:00.909> probably<00:04:01.780> most<00:04:02.049> other<00:04:02.319> weapons<00:04:02.799> in<00:04:02.919> the

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
and probably most other weapons in the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.039 
and probably most other weapons in the
game<00:04:03.040> but<00:04:03.489> it's<00:04:03.669> really<00:04:03.939> know<00:04:04.509> when<00:04:04.720> there<00:04:04.930> is

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
game but it's really know when there is

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.640 
game but it's really know when there is
bad<00:04:05.290> as<00:04:05.530> LMGs<00:04:06.359> so<00:04:07.359> to<00:04:07.449> summarize<00:04:07.930> what<00:04:08.319> does<00:04:08.530> it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
bad as LMGs so to summarize what does it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.349 
bad as LMGs so to summarize what does it
all<00:04:08.799> mean<00:04:08.829> how<00:04:09.280> will<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.549> affect<00:04:09.609> you<00:04:10.120> in

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
all mean how will this affect you in

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.050 
all mean how will this affect you in
game<00:04:10.689> well<00:04:11.409> my<00:04:11.680> advice<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:12.009> if<00:04:12.459> you're<00:04:12.609> using<00:04:12.849> a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
game well my advice is if you're using a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.879 
game well my advice is if you're using a
belt-fed<00:04:13.419> OMG<00:04:14.019> don't<00:04:14.439> shoot<00:04:14.739> immediately

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
belt-fed OMG don't shoot immediately

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.129 
belt-fed OMG don't shoot immediately
once<00:04:15.729> you<00:04:15.879> start<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.329> aiming<00:04:16.630> d<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:16.870> site

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
once you start the aiming d on site

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.229 
once you start the aiming d on site
animation<00:04:17.829> or<00:04:18.280> else<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.579> get<00:04:18.729> hit<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.120> an

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
animation or else you get hit with an

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.420 
animation or else you get hit with an
insane<00:04:19.780> amount<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.199> spread<00:04:20.650> just<00:04:20.949> give<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.400> a

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
insane amount of spread just give it a

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.920 
insane amount of spread just give it a
bit<00:04:21.579> of<00:04:21.669> time<00:04:21.909> before<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.389> pull<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.780> trigger

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
bit of time before you pull the trigger

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.870 
bit of time before you pull the trigger
but<00:04:23.770> in<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:23.979> heat<00:04:24.159> at<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.370> moment<00:04:24.729> most

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
but in the heat at the moment most

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.399 
but in the heat at the moment most
players<00:04:25.210> probably<00:04:25.570> just<00:04:25.900> hold<00:04:26.110> down<00:04:26.169> the

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
players probably just hold down the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.320 
players probably just hold down the
trigger<00:04:26.710> straight<00:04:27.159> away<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.610> suffer<00:04:28.150> the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
trigger straight away and suffer the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.899 
trigger straight away and suffer the
insane<00:04:28.900> spread<00:04:29.349> without<00:04:29.530> even<00:04:30.070> realizing<00:04:30.789> it

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
insane spread without even realizing it

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.240 
insane spread without even realizing it
however<00:04:31.570> yes<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:32.020> know<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.229> might<00:04:32.469> seem<00:04:32.530> like<00:04:32.830> an

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
however yes I know it might seem like an

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.879 
however yes I know it might seem like an
intended<00:04:33.789> mechanic<00:04:34.300> as<00:04:34.449> dilated<00:04:35.409> tone<00:04:35.710> down

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
intended mechanic as dilated tone down

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.760 
intended mechanic as dilated tone down
the<00:04:36.130> LMGs<00:04:36.580> overall<00:04:37.150> in<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.510> spring<00:04:37.810> patch<00:04:38.050> but

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the LMGs overall in the spring patch but

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.839 
the LMGs overall in the spring patch but
like<00:04:38.949> I<00:04:39.070> said<00:04:39.130> before<00:04:39.370> the

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
like I said before the

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.850 
like I said before the
people<00:04:40.149> on<00:04:40.300> CTA<00:04:40.809> that<00:04:41.020> have<00:04:41.199> brought<00:04:41.499> up<00:04:41.740> this

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
people on CTA that have brought up this

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.309 
people on CTA that have brought up this
issue<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:42.369> many<00:04:42.729> occasions<00:04:43.360> have<00:04:43.779> been<00:04:44.020> told

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
issue on many occasions have been told

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.589 
issue on many occasions have been told
either<00:04:44.529> by<00:04:44.800> CTA<00:04:45.369> community<00:04:46.059> member<00:04:46.449> or<00:04:46.569> a

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
either by CTA community member or a

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.139 
either by CTA community member or a
dice'll<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.169> devta<00:04:47.439> posted<00:04:48.099> in<00:04:48.279> the<00:04:48.399> BF<00:04:48.789> tracker

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:49.149 
dice'll a devta posted in the BF tracker

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.269 
dice'll a devta posted in the BF tracker
website<00:04:49.449> that<00:04:50.080> tracks<00:04:50.289> all<00:04:50.559> the<00:04:50.679> problems<00:04:51.159> in

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:51.279 
website that tracks all the problems in

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.909 
website that tracks all the problems in
the<00:04:51.309> game<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:51.969> if<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.569> was<00:04:52.749> intended<00:04:53.199> I<00:04:53.439> really

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
the game so if it was intended I really

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.589 
the game so if it was intended I really
don't<00:04:54.159> think<00:04:54.219> they<00:04:54.490> would<00:04:54.610> say<00:04:54.849> to<00:04:54.909> add<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.419> to

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
don't think they would say to add it to

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.350 
don't think they would say to add it to
the<00:04:55.809> BF<00:04:56.349> tracker<00:04:56.759> also<00:04:57.759> this<00:04:57.909> hipfire<00:04:58.330> spread

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
the BF tracker also this hipfire spread

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.659 
the BF tracker also this hipfire spread
is<00:04:58.869> she<00:04:59.050> went<00:04:59.229> aiming<00:04:59.589> down<00:04:59.709> sights<00:04:59.770> from<00:05:00.309> what

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
is she went aiming down sights from what

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.669 
is she went aiming down sights from what
I<00:05:00.699> can<00:05:00.819> remember<00:05:01.029> was<00:05:01.599> a<00:05:01.719> fairly<00:05:01.990> big<00:05:02.199> problem

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:02.679 
I can remember was a fairly big problem

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:04.709 
I can remember was a fairly big problem
when<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.919> game<00:05:03.129> first<00:05:03.159> came<00:05:03.639> out<00:05:03.849> but<00:05:04.270> i<00:05:04.659> do

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
when the game first came out but i do

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.260 
when the game first came out but i do
remember<00:05:04.959> there<00:05:05.409> being<00:05:05.439> a<00:05:05.770> patch<00:05:06.069> that

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
remember there being a patch that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.359 
remember there being a patch that
supposedly<00:05:07.270> fix<00:05:07.719> the<00:05:07.929> problems<00:05:08.349> so<00:05:08.679> i'm<00:05:09.159> not

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:09.369 
supposedly fix the problems so i'm not

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:10.889 
supposedly fix the problems so i'm not
too<00:05:09.429> sure<00:05:09.580> if<00:05:09.729> maybe<00:05:10.029> this<00:05:10.300> problem<00:05:10.689> was

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:10.899 
too sure if maybe this problem was

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:12.929 
too sure if maybe this problem was
reintroduced<00:05:11.499> into<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.339> game<00:05:12.550> since<00:05:12.849> the

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:12.939 
reintroduced into the game since the

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.149 
reintroduced into the game since the
spring<00:05:13.119> patch<00:05:13.449> a<00:05:13.659> couple<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.139> months<00:05:14.409> ago<00:05:14.649> well

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
spring patch a couple of months ago well

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:16.769 
spring patch a couple of months ago well
it's<00:05:15.279> actually<00:05:15.459> been<00:05:15.849> the<00:05:16.029> game<00:05:16.179> even<00:05:16.569> before

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
it's actually been the game even before

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.079 
it's actually been the game even before
that<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.529> mean<00:05:17.769> who<00:05:17.979> really<00:05:18.189> knows<00:05:18.519> but<00:05:18.819> in<00:05:18.939> my

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.089 
that I mean who really knows but in my

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.089 
that I mean who really knows but in my
opinion<00:05:19.209> I<00:05:19.749> don't<00:05:20.139> think<00:05:20.409> weapons<00:05:20.889> should

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
opinion I don't think weapons should

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.850 
opinion I don't think weapons should
behave<00:05:21.459> like<00:05:21.729> this<00:05:21.969> at<00:05:22.179> all<00:05:22.419> in<00:05:22.719> the<00:05:22.839> game<00:05:23.050> even

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
behave like this at all in the game even

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.339 
behave like this at all in the game even
