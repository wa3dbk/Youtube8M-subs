00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
they don't even give it back so I don't

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.539 
they don't even give it back so I don't
know<00:04:16.200> what<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> review<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.070> guess<00:04:17.220> it's<00:04:17.400> so

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
know what the review is I guess it's so

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.729

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
review it's just their policy but they

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.310 
review it's just their policy but they
don't<00:04:24.030> actually<00:04:24.150> review<00:04:24.570> for<00:04:24.720> bugs<00:04:24.900> I'm<00:04:25.140> not

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
sure what all the reviewing process is

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.760 
sure what all the reviewing process is
but<00:04:27.840> they<00:04:27.990> do<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.260> for<00:04:28.440> one<00:04:28.530> or<00:04:28.620> two<00:04:28.650> weeks

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
but they do that for one or two weeks

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.400 
but they do that for one or two weeks
and<00:04:29.480> usually<00:04:30.480> it<00:04:30.570> seems<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.870> be<00:04:30.930> released<00:04:31.200> on

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410

don't take my word for that it just

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.260 
don't take my word for that it just
seems<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.070> happen<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:39.030> if<00:04:39.090> you're<00:04:39.210> ever
