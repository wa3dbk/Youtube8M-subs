00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.790
 I'm better with the score to be discarded 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.880
 compared to giving me business, at least here it is 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.090
 now he is thinking to the world not to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.860
 world cup is second with a delay 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.580
 very small cork cat both 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.039
 they are great competitive players to keep 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.390
 an eye on the departure of markus prock 44 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:29.070
 24 time a vigorous fast push 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.560
 searching in position speed 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 aerodynamics and is even slower 4 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 hundredths of delay 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 42 anti-38 thousandths to be exact 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 now 25 196 for a better test and then 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.079
 back in the head from a discreet 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 advantage however after the first run 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.700
 and on the adversary hero also in 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 relationship and even better even 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.260
 6 cents is gaining the athlete 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.090
 blue attention here extraordinary 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.789
 beautiful how he painted this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.370
 straight 40 20 66 took flight 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.799
 in this descent and is the best time 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.570
 of manche very clearly gave the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.760
 beauty of 15 cents has proc 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.180
 the satisfied beauty armin zoeggeler 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.369
 in the last few years it just took place 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.810
 he had also been bronte with his feet 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.820
 European Championships was fake to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.250
 last world championships when it was bronze that the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.799
 tenor the grit the great determination of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:36.600
 race time says claire 44 59 a is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:40.920
 already better than oracle has earned e 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.070
 now we have 20 57 81 for the blue 7 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.840
 61 two tenths of an advantage because one 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.200
 good its really good descent 748 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.540
 for the blue 30 27 26 always these two 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.450
 tenths of an advantage over 2 cents are 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.810
 many of us go to the decisive straight 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.969
 splendid for zoeggeler is still in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.340
 advantage of little but beware that 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.880
 there is a mistake we go to see 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.020
 on arrival udc and gold for armin zoeggeler 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.750
 this 49 802 is clearly superior to the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.980
 49 7 71 is happy but maybe not yet 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.980
 well verified the result
