00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149 

all<00:00:00.149> the<00:00:00.359> fuel<00:00:00.630> to<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.319> engine<00:00:01.560> goes<00:00:01.949> through

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
all the fuel to this engine goes through

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.470 
all the fuel to this engine goes through
this<00:00:02.280> pipe<00:00:03.440> one<00:00:04.440> gallon<00:00:04.830> every<00:00:04.950> second<00:00:05.580> during

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
this pipe one gallon every second during

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.950 
this pipe one gallon every second during
takeoff<00:00:06.930> per<00:00:07.440> engine<00:00:08.090> so<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.420> know<00:00:09.540> get<00:00:09.840> on

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
takeoff per engine so you know get on

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.810 
takeoff per engine so you know get on
the<00:00:10.019> water<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.340> fuel<00:00:11.580> every<00:00:16.820> secondly

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the water now on the fuel every secondly

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.990 
the water now on the fuel every secondly
four<00:00:18.779> gallons<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.350> minute<00:00:19.550> when<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.580> run<00:00:20.850> from

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
four gallons a minute when you run from

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.870 
four gallons a minute when you run from
idle<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.359> full<00:00:21.779> power<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.859> gal<00:00:23.070> sixty<00:00:23.580> gallons

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
idle to full power one gal sixty gallons

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.670 
idle to full power one gal sixty gallons
a<00:00:23.970> minute<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:24.869> from<00:00:24.990> four<00:00:25.260> gallons<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
a minute so we go from four gallons a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.400 
a minute so we go from four gallons a
minute<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.189> 15<00:00:26.640> times<00:00:26.849> more<00:00:27.289> look<00:00:28.289> at<00:00:28.410> this

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
minute to 15 times more look at this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.319 
minute to 15 times more look at this
oh<00:00:31.410> that's<00:00:31.619> those<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.399> ground<00:00:32.730> adjustments

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
oh that's those are ground adjustments

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.540 
oh that's those are ground adjustments
to<00:00:33.540> tune<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.960> fuel<00:00:34.620> control<00:00:34.770> unit<00:00:35.219> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to tune the fuel control unit it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
to tune the fuel control unit it's
called<00:00:35.820> trimming<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> engine<00:00:36.750> mm-hmm<00:00:37.410> yeah

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
called trimming the engine mm-hmm yeah

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.910 
called trimming the engine mm-hmm yeah
and<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.960> this<00:00:39.960> year<00:00:40.290> that's<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.649> fire

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and this one this year that's a fire

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.549 
and this one this year that's a fire
detector<00:00:41.430> loop<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> hold

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
detector loop this is just here to hold

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
detector loop this is just here to hold
these<00:00:44.309> these<00:00:45.120> sense<00:00:45.539> fires<00:00:45.899> these<00:00:47.000> that's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
these these sense fires these that's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.959 
these these sense fires these that's
just<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> framework<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.520> sensor

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
just a framework for this the sensor

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
just a framework for this the sensor
array<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.930> down<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
array see it going down this is the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
array see it going down this is the
engine<00:00:53.340> hot<00:00:53.520> section<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> fire

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
engine hot section so if you have a fire

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
engine hot section so if you have a fire
this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> where<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.890> gonna<00:00:55.949> pick<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this is where you're gonna pick up the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
this is where you're gonna pick up the
heat<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.629> tells<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.079> crew<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> fire

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
heat it tells a crew you get a fire

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.220 
heat it tells a crew you get a fire
alarm<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.030> through<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.359> receiver

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
alarm and you go through your receiver

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
alarm and you go through your receiver
put<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> look<00:01:02.460> through<00:01:02.550> these<00:01:02.699> done

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
put it on and look through these done

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
