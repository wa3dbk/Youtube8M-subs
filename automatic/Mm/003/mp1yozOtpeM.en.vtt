 Without the vehicle papers, I can give them 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.079
 do not give the car 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:11.030

 History of miles just played by 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.180
 elizabeth banks she is one 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.099
 newsreader actually 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.930
 Satisfied with your job relative 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.790
 happy but she gets the chance 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.739
 on a very big place as 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.810
 anchor at a big tv station 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.690
 Of course, that's what yours is 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.349
 professional genus is the only way she had a 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.760
 will be second only to interviews 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.349
 is the depressed as her friend 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.910
 then the trend is the shit 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.950
 really cooking and she decides 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.569
 to party with the girls 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.220
 follow suit and completely drunk 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.900
 lands it there with a guy in the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.760
 crate as the call comes that they are the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.560
 mailbox bugged that, apparently 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.150
 but chances on the job but has in the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.489
 next hours necessarily always said 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.620
 channel or in the rough tv channel 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.209
 must show up and that is the road 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.860
 Trip metaphor once fundamentally 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.150
 and so Merkel times as 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.170
 somehow move through the city 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.790
 then the cars then between 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.959
 towed and it will be with you 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.519
 faced a whole lot of problems 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.349
 she was not in vain with unfortunately 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.510
 wearing a yellow dress is that 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.160
 makes her look a little bolder 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.780
 at least that's your own choice of word 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.100
 In the movie it is considered by many as 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.140
 prostitutes handled and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.700
 at the same time she does too 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.019
 acquaintance with which drug dealer 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 there you have to say that girls evening 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.049
 just such a movie is there , I thought 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.220
 first time pregnant is not at all 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.260
 Funny but I have to say it honestly 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.880
 movie is much better than the trailer and 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.829
 many moments really funny and also 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.180
 not just a typical girls' day 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.890
 movie and also a punishment for which I 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.690
 say that elizabeth banks have that 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.280
 whole for the comedy really good on her 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.660
 shoulders right and also despite her 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.519
 absolute beauty the woman sees 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.109
 definitely to bite off in her 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.730
 Skin tight dress during this whole 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.440
 films are always ready too 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.030
 little courage to show ugliness 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.100
 to have fun with yourself 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.139
 and that's why girls on 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.579
 or walk of shame I think 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.290
 the original title, frankly, a lot 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.970
 better a comedy where I have to say 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.620
 you do not have to see that but that is 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.000
 better than the trailer and also was 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.079
 not easy and maybe you can 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.269
 also do with a beer or 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.950
 Sexually in the cinema and gets from me 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.600
 as a comedy proper 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.250
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.920
 clear and then stroked over a 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.600
 movie of this world 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.280
 a movie you must have seen 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.930
 a total of five and a half out of 10 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.579
 possible points but that's okay 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.830
 is and there i have through my review 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.150
 like to thumb on girls occasion if you 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.440
 This might let it we do not stay 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.480
 otherwise there is left to me 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.440
 rum and tomorrow at 15 o'clock at the latest one 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.060
 new video 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.790
 if it then I hope for weeks 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.790
 again, of course, on 3
