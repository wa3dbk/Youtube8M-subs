00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.500
 nice all guys soler 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.349
 today I bring you a video on 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.130
 buying and selling in the fifa 14 web app 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:24.570
 ultimate team I tell you right away what I have 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.779
 done below obviously you will see the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.529
 images of my sale 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.929
 this year I know why so windy but oh well 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:38.309
 I bought some peluso and kovacic a 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:42.690
 350 and sold at 450 kg on the gain is 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.889
 really at the top something is vip network already 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.039
 that you will make maximum 12k per day because 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:52.769
 it's really hard to trade 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.850
 then I also took the constant a thousand 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:00.239
 come to 1300 and juan jesus defender 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 central of the Brazilian bought 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.100
 at 1800 and sold 2100 is a player 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.100
 less known than inigo martinez 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.350
 central defender of the real sociedad 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.790
 Spanish bought at 1100 sold to the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.270
 1300 and then I used a very technique 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.000
 known of the players bought 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 efficient now via vsphere and everything 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.020
 you need to buy players 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 gold not rare by type 75 76 of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 evaluation buy them at 300 and resell them 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.300
 at 400 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.070
 obviously it wo n't work with everyone 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.880
 because with me it worked with five 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.800
 like 20 players I bought but 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.330
 oh another another method that is 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.260
 that of role changes have taken away the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:05.550
 change form but left the changes 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.810
 role and you have to exploit them to change 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:13.760
 role because there are people who put these 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.210
 cards to really have a low price 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.990
 type anc a few days ago I took a 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.490
 change of role to titti 500 atp 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:31.110
 resold at 3000 so really good I have 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:35.220
 so take advantage of this opportunity and to 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.460
 end video I will leave you a banner let's say 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.150
 with prices and varicose 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.250
 I remind you that these are the prices 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 let's say base for that will really change 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.710
 so then before buying them 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.260
 always check how the market is doing 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.900
 if you have questions, please ask 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.030
 comments and beers ends here 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.030
