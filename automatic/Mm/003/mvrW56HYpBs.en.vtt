00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
it's more talking about warhammer

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.679 
it's more talking about warhammer
overall<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.310> what<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.519> actually<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:30.150> for

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
overall and what it can actually do for

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.679 
doing all my tests there I would do a
lot<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.159> warhammer<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.479> really

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
it has to be a thing definitely where

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.990 
it has to be a thing definitely where
you're<00:03:08.600> enjoying<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.890> game<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.730> really

you're enjoying the game and it's really

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.390 
you're enjoying the game and it's really
going<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.180> go<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.569> pull<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.470> away<00:03:13.620> right<00:03:14.190> if

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
going to go and pull you away right if

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.100 
going to go and pull you away right if
it's<00:03:14.880> something<00:03:15.090> where<00:03:15.360> you're<00:03:15.450> playing<00:03:15.720> some

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
it's something where you're playing some

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.690 
it's something where you're playing some
sort<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:17.630> mindless<00:03:18.980> version<00:03:19.980> or<00:03:20.310> something

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
sort of a mindless version or something

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.030 
sort of a mindless version or something
like<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.140> it's<00:03:22.140> probably<00:03:22.530> not<00:03:22.709> going<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.890> do

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
like that it's probably not going to do

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.789 
like that it's probably not going to do
it<00:03:23.130> for<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.750> know<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.049> just<00:03:25.560> go

it for you but you know just just go

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.340 
it for you but you know just just go
thur<00:03:26.100> into<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.519> do<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.820> thing<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.350> don't

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
thur into it and do that thing and don't

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.979 
thur into it and do that thing and don't
feel<00:03:28.560> bad<00:03:28.799> for<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.160> either<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.670> i<00:03:29.850> said<00:03:30.180> it

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
feel bad for it either like i said it

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.960 
feel bad for it either like i said it
then<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.440> day<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.859> i<00:03:31.920> might<00:03:32.100> seem<00:03:32.370> silly<00:03:32.609> that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
then the day and i might seem silly that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.250 
then the day and i might seem silly that
all<00:03:33.090> we<00:03:33.209> know<00:03:33.299> something<00:03:33.690> serious<00:03:34.109> is<00:03:34.170> going

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
all we know something serious is going

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.009 
all we know something serious is going
on<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.950> your<00:03:35.340> first<00:03:35.700> intuition<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.780> go<00:03:36.900> and

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
on and your first intuition is to go and

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.770 
on and your first intuition is to go and
pull<00:03:37.200> out<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.500> toys<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.579> at<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.420> end<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> day

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
pull out the toys but at the end the day

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.530 
pull out the toys but at the end the day
it's<00:03:39.959> all<00:03:40.079> about<00:03:40.579> getting<00:03:41.579> that<00:03:41.880> stress<00:03:42.269> off

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
it's all about getting that stress off

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.380 
it's all about getting that stress off
your<00:03:42.600> back<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.470> getting<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.459> back<00:03:44.730> into<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
your back and getting you back into the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.819 
your back and getting you back into the
you<00:03:45.840> know<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.230> able<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.440> function<00:03:46.799> normally

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
you know to be able to function normally

so there you go a really quick one

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.220 
so there you go a really quick one
that's<00:03:50.310> kind<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.850> just<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.299> little<00:03:51.810> different

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
that's kind of just a little different

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.560

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.289 
twist on it a little something a little
bit<00:03:54.720> personal<00:03:55.230> here<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.940> know<00:03:57.060> something

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
I think it'd be good for them to keep in

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.130 
I think it'd be good for them to keep in
