00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.600
 with your sub-20 country as you see the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.450
 night a difficult game for the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.900
 selection with some threats of chile 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 that is without technical a good match of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
 high-grade always these parties to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 times when there are bad situations 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 define define things I think but 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.779
 but what is going to be hard is going to be hard 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.789
 because chile is also a team that 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.830
 he knows he has to recover that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.210
 mystical that I had been doing at the beginning 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.790
 of year where he was in the first 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 position then it will not be easy for 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.030
 neither of the two Argentines comes from 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.950
 win a match against Uruguay comes 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 first in the tie with the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 good trust you know everything is from 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.270
 messi then it's going to be a party I think 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.820
 that first level hopefully you can 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 present well so good luck 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.690
 from tonight to go see him with 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.430
 some colleagues and enjoy a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.739
 cute party for us you were 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.940
 messi partner in the sub-20 I do not know if 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910
 I went which is what is the recipe for 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 mark in the sky 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.290
 It seems to eat and there is no recipes 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.630
 recipe no recipes last night I had the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.950
 opportunity to share with him and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.860
 We had with Ramón Fernández 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 I have a concentration of the national team 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.250
 with many colleagues because the truth 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.130
 that today in the great majority of the establishment 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.050
 of Argentina I was companion sub-20 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.560
 all then well we were there 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.460
 sharing and I think messi is 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 totally different from everything that is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.430
 one can play and think about how 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.160
 mark it messi improvises everything that 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.710
 does it have a speed for me more 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.050
 mental that what is and there goes with it 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.650
 on his feet it is clear then they are 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.570
 players who sincerely so that for 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.210
 that are well marked have to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 get up very badly but very badly and what 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 good of messi that never gets up wrong 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.880
 always get up with the same 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.040
 enthusiasm of that 20 year old boy 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 who came out that kid's world champion 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.970
 that's good and we know what in the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.160
 barcelona I'm not discovering anything and 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.200
 that's what messi has that really 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.540
 makes the difference since you get up 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.980
 so 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.140
 he is a player who really can not be 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.350
 say how to mark it because it's clear 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 that has a level above all 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.530
 far selection I leave you the meeting and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.880
 I'm asking you about the trade 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.710
 of humility what messi has achieved 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.450
 he was a partner a few years ago like 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.130
 he received him a very well very well 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.660
 we had the room 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.430
 sharing so good with some 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.620
 boys eggs months liver everything 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.570
 partner that they were there in the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.430
 sub-20 we had a process of 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.870
 the 17 years together then there is a 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.340
 from unam was out there today 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.750
 in football it sounds weird to say this 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.790
 because I still have the level that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.040
 it sounds logically that it sounds weird but 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.510
 but it's like sharing with and with my 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.200
 colleagues in anger and tomorrow 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.550
 any player can consecrate and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.350
 I imagine that you really can not 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.940
 forget about the companions and that what 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.280
 what makes the big ones different 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.500
 people and this is what left me 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.060
 proud to have been received by my 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.000
 companions 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.790
 of the sub-20 with that with that degree of 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.470
 humility of being or of charisma with those 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.910
 I want to share that really 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.340
 they made me feel very comfortable so it's 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.020
 good morning over forgiveness today of the night 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.959
 of going to encourage it is not clear that in my 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.640
 country I do not want July to win in the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.010
 qualifiers for argentine france 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.750
 it was exactly what Chile is like 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.400
 Chile beats Argentina here 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.010
 first time and he goes to the Argentine coach 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.959
 basile I think it was at the time 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.780
 who is now in reverse is how 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.110
 You see, the national dressing room is difficult 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.890
 as I said just when you're wrong you're 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.900
 so in such adverse situations matches 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.670
 how they define a lot because if you win 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.340
 logically chile is already coming again 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.200
 Argentina forgets everything that was talked about 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.120
 of boris I always say the same thing in 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.840
 we exist football will always exist 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.610
 then you really know that a 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.670
 result sometimes in situations with the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.220
 bad gen takes away from the post or you 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.830
 keeps then I think tonight is 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.750
 a great test logically for to 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.760
 Chile more than anything because of the degree 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.610
 today he is going through adversity 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.010
 it has been said globally that it is 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.420
 intimidated by medel when he plays like 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.829
 who does not like to play next to measure 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.130
 because it intimidates him a bit the truth that 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:22.160
 no more than anything we were talking about 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.660
 things that he owed the children we did not 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.580
 We found for him seven years ten 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.590
 global and good he's about to have his 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.600
 son yo with my daughter who was born in chile 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.789
 all the boys also already dad 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.320
 then in 11 when it meets with a 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.330
 friends usually shares more than 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.800
 nothing of life there and that 's what 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.380
 nice and nice when you leave the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.780
 dressing room to live things a little 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.430
 as beautiful as the family 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.190
 he asks you he asks you something of 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.840
 o'higgins month and in July yesterday no 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.870
 ask I did not tell him to come on Saturday 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.479
 to encourage us and if we fill the is the 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.760
 stadium but unfortunately they have to 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.039
 travel after matches grenade in a 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.479
 little joke but but since I said 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.729
 as one has a degree of confidence in 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.190
 a boy makes those jokes and can 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.780
 have a good time and laugh then but 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.830
 cute that they also know that a 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.590
 partner where was everyone 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.900
 we know of all those players each 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.620
 is playing then it's nice that 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.360
 because it shows that there was a nice degree 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.460
 of friendship to a month we share in the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.710
 world are then situations that do not 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.110
 they forget and as I said the time I spent 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.110
 very good very happy is something for me not 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.580
 very motivating staff to feel 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.140
 so with players who are today 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.140
 consecrated in his equipment europe
