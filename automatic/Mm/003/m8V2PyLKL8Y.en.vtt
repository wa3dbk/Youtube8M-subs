00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 and there we are in one more drops 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.080
 comicon rs com fabiano denardin the guy 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.000
 responsible for editing the comic books 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.570
 legal that came to the stands every 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.610
 months 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.460
 he's the mother-in-law the first time here for the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.080
 people give a nice time to talk, huh? 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.680
 generally I can escape but the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.810
 vinícius is a good Fabian journalist who 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 have to launch the vertica hugo or 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.890
 Vertigo to be transmitted on vert converted 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 I speak, I do not speak vertigo 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 sorry now I had to run away I said 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.820
 Vert a certain I think it would be 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.250
 fun but I prefer open it has 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.570
 launch can tell us something about 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 We have two releases to go out. 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 now that it is not promise and love that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.629
 I think I've already been threatened with death by 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.079
 Agent does not publish it in Brazil but 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.870
 it's going to be ready edited probably 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.610
 is already on the way to the distributor 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.079
 now it will be how this material should 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.079
 Rotating outside Brazil takes time. 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 to arrive and a y the last man already 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.289
 published all 10 volumes 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.870
 bound original but now it will exit 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 in Five Issues of Hardcover 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 for bookstores 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 I already checked the image, okay? 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.080
 beautiful is not it 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.650
 cool is cool or not it is a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.610
 Larger format is also a beauty I 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 I have 10 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.500
 but I think I'll tell you why 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.689
 face is y is more modern curiosity 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.830
 which publisher is the worst 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.780
 Predicted gibe of vertigo I will not go 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.720
 to say exactly to each one has 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 a work shift here but no bullets 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 the chance it and anything to use 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.869
 she writes is complicated because the underdog 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.180
 loves to make pun and do things 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.340
 together the triple sense then does not have 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 How to put all this in translation is 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.630
 often have to sacrifice one 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.670
 sense of applying some joke 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.820
 if you get to see all the titles and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.960
 they sway some kind of pun 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.539
 thing that has to do with history 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.850
 then it worked hard 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:58.130
 had balloons that stayed half an hour 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.890
 thinking to solve this in our 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.170
 specific things so this is a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.750
 That's a lot of work, I've heard 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.819
 the panini people commenting on 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.590
 that 's also his that has a monkey 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.390
 did it right 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.700
 it was also impossible because he created 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.810
 a language that invented things 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.370
 in the beginning we did not have much 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.380
 reference to know exactly what 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.060
 he referred to it but then it was quiet 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.220
 I have traditionally asked here of 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.900
 porto alegre also guilherme braga e 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.590
 he studies both letters we stayed 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.319
 discussing discussed all the rules that 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.880
 people use it in Portuguese based on 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.769
 he was English then became easy 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.230
 afterwards but it was a production job 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.840
 great southern still sorry to l'amour 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.489
 not so impossible so showed the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.829
 how relatively quiet is it 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.480
 promised a lady also had to have a 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:52.459
 whole edition that animated 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.500
 it is a poetry of a lot of work but the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.239
 secret to get you and make a 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.889
 quieter production is to choose a 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.739
 translator that I think has to do with 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.139
 job he got on the plane is a guy who 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.230
 I already studied, I promised and I'll do my doctorate. 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.180
 study writes of literature does other 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.430
 stuff like that, so it ended up helping 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.959
 enough that he already knew much of the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.020
 universe promised so this made it easier 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.290
 But like translating poetry is terrible. 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.360
 very difficult but it is good to know what is 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.130
 rolling now let's enjoy it 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.500
 formally present 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.600
 the hypothetical gallery what space is that 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.400
 People already did video there commented me and the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.160
 Daniel also presents us with 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.230
 formally as the hypothetical galley the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.820
 space that in porto alegre is in the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.890
 neighborhood forest street viscount river 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.960
 white 4 3 1 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.890
 I and my wife we ​​work today 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.280

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.400
 she enjoys photography likes 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.590
 comics people like art in general 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.690
 and teeth or do one with something 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.580
 that bring our tastes and people together 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.680
 thought he could do it and 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.480
 arrived in gallery format 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.280

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.120
 legal editorial balloon something of the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.160
 Mythos has argonaut that is a publisher 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.540

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.670
