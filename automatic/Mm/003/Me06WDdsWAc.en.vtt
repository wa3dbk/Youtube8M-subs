00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.269
 we are not going to decorate a simple furniture and 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.189
 we are going to turn it into what they are 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 seeing for that we're going to need a 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.509
 electric screwdriver if you do not have a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.570
 electric screwdriver then you can 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.419
 perfectly use a screwdriver 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.969
 of all mechanical life we're also going to 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.579
 need a tape measure or a ruler 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:35.440
 to measure it we will also need 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.300
 scissors 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.300
 a cloth to clean the area 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.980
 Scotch tape 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.450
 and papers of your choice, either paper 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.060
 of gift or wallpaper in this case 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.120
 I'm using contact papers that are 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.610
 they bring stickers behind and a ruler 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.550
 quite resistant and is that they use a 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.339
 metal rule and let's start to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.330
 make this economic design of a piece of furniture 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.420
 simple to turn elegant and beautiful 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.400
 let's start first 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.670
 unscrewing all the handles of the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 drawer if you do not have this then you pass 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.250
 this step do the following once 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.130
 let's take out all the handles of the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.560
 we will make sure that it is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.290
 clean and let's measure the anchor and the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.250
 slang of the drawer for this way 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.229
 cut our paper contact or paper 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.110
 that you prefer, you do not need 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.690
 is necessarily this role that I am 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.650
 employing me the job because it is 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.780
 much easier to work them 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.300
 and because I was lucky to find it 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.270
 in a store of a whole euro or a whole 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.190
 dollar and good so go to see the same 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.040
 They have their art and they find a role 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.170
 this so I took advantage and I bought myself 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.720
 these usually cost a little more 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.000
 expensive but good if you're lucky and 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.670
 you also find so take advantage and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.220
 I bought a good enough 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.870
 cut the measurement and once I cut 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.480
 all and remove the handle then let's 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.490
 proceed to paste the ends we are going to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.310
 make sure that it is properly secured 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.730
 extreme let's measure it well and let's go 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.010
 little by little step by step hitting this 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.750
 paper in this case if you have a paper of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.890
 gift, what you are going to do is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.020
 First 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.990
 in the same way secure with tape 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.750
 adhesive to the ends and you're also going to 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.620
 go securing all the edges a little bit 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.489
 little bit 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.159
 I pass the cloth so it's done 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.190
 all the air bubble that usually has 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.440
 the stickers after classes so they do not 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.739
 I stayed pretty smooth and this way 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.870
 Be well and well once I have 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.659
 all that happened the rule to make sure 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.209
 that is totally smooth and also with 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.659
 the rule I make sure to double the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.629
 folds that are under the drawer and with 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.940
 the adhesive tape I will make sure 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.910
 that with the humidity does not take off this 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.650
 paper and we will fully ensure the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.260
 edge the same would do with any 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.420
 another role and in this way we 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.390
 would be quite subject we are going to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.180
 make sure we paste it pretty well that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.090
 not visible from the adhesive tape that 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.010
 it is quite inside the drawer and we 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.519
 it would be this way once 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.370
 let's have her stuck all and secured 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.440
 let's proceed to put again the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.870
 metal handles is very easy 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.090
 we're just going to go smoothly to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.990
 do not break the paper we're going to go spinning 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.870
 as 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.940
 they are screws in this case then up 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.970
 press and it comes out 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.100
 once we have the software 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.530
 we apply the handles again and 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.300
 we would have ready 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.820
 we will do the same in all 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.120
 drawers the same process and it would already be 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.720
 this chest of drawers another action that I give you is 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.140
 if you want you can use the glue 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.050
 mixed with water and you can also paste 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.330
 the paper that you have and then you pass 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.459
 a clear varnish in this way 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.220
 it looks pretty nice too and very 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.950
 economic and in this case I have put 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.870
 a black ribbon that you are seeing this 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.320
 tape is the same as that used 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.040
 normally the people who work with 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.050
 electricity to bundle cables and good is 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.820
 the same super economic and comes in 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.670
 several colors and I have opted this time 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.550
 by a black woman who beat her well in 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.920
 edges and it gives me this finish so 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.800
 these are very economical ways of 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.050
 redecorate an old piece of furniture or a piece of furniture 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.060
 old or simply a piece of furniture 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.940
 he has a lot of joke and you want it 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.090
 decorate and adapt a little to your 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.460
 room or your place, that's all 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.289
 if you liked, do not forget to rate 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.659
 this video share them and has them 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.599
 seemed interesting to subscribe if not 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:10.979
 you are subscribed and we see you until the 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.979
 next day bye 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.760
