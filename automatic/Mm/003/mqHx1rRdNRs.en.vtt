00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
lot more shiny and I can just feel the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.880 
lot more shiny and I can just feel the
difference<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> has<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.549> hair<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.240> I

personally am loving the shampoo it is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.920 
personally am loving the shampoo it is
on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.110> pricey<00:01:31.939> side<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.630> it's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
on the more pricey side but I think it's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.149 
on the more pricey side but I think it's
worth<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.869> normally<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.470> $15

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
worth it and normally it would be $15

00:01:38.159 --> 00:02:01.620 
worth it and normally it would be $15

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
I'm I'm stopping to use heat because I

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.770 
I'm I'm stopping to use heat because I
feel<00:03:24.489> like<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.850> want<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.180> grow<00:03:25.299> my<00:03:25.420> hair<00:03:25.450> really

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
feel like I want to grow my hair really

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.800 
feel like I want to grow my hair really
long<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.709> with<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:28.030> stop<00:03:28.480> using

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
long and with that I have to stop using

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.410 
long and with that I have to stop using
heat<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:29.859> when<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.370> use<00:03:30.790> heat<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.269> it's

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
heat but when I do use heat and it's

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.699 
heat but when I do use heat and it's
probably<00:03:31.690> like<00:03:31.989> once<00:03:32.319> a<00:03:32.440> month

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
probably like once a month

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.970 
probably like once a month
but<00:03:33.069> since<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.340> competition<00:03:33.549> time<00:03:34.239> now<00:03:34.480> I'm

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but since this competition time now I'm

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.309 
but since this competition time now I'm
using<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.220> lot<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.819> heat<00:03:37.180> tamer<00:03:37.389> spray<00:03:37.569> and<00:03:38.079> I'm

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
using a lot of heat tamer spray and I'm

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.849 
using a lot of heat tamer spray and I'm
out<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:39.250> never<00:03:39.569> really<00:03:40.569> use<00:03:40.870> heat<00:03:41.200> tamer<00:03:41.410> spring

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
out I never really use heat tamer spring

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.069 
out I never really use heat tamer spring
I<00:03:42.190> don't<00:03:42.670> know<00:03:42.760> why<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.000> just<00:03:43.389> figured<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.780> it

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
I don't know why I just figured that it

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.660 
I don't know why I just figured that it
didn't<00:03:44.380> really<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.859> anything<00:03:45.040> for<00:03:45.310> my<00:03:45.430> hair

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
didn't really do anything for my hair

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.120 
didn't really do anything for my hair
but<00:03:45.940> I'm<00:03:46.450> definitely<00:03:46.690> using<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:47.560> since<00:03:47.889> I

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
but I'm definitely using it now since I

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.650 
but I'm definitely using it now since I
really<00:03:48.579> do<00:03:48.790> want<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.030> grow<00:03:49.180> my<00:03:49.269> hair<00:03:49.299> long<00:03:49.510> and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
really do want to grow my hair long and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.539 
really do want to grow my hair long and
I<00:03:49.959> don't<00:03:50.019> want<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.650> kill<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.829> because<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.489> used

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
I don't want to kill it because I used

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.210 
I don't want to kill it because I used
to<00:03:51.730> not<00:03:51.940> really<00:03:51.970> care<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.410> see<00:03:54.010> like<00:03:54.190> a

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
to not really care but now I see like a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.270 
to not really care but now I see like a
lot<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.549> girls<00:03:54.790> have<00:03:54.970> long<00:03:55.209> hair<00:03:55.569> and<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.079> have

comb from Konya that I got to turn it
and<00:05:17.840> I<00:05:19.510> just<00:05:20.510> figured<00:05:21.260> out<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:21.800> went<00:05:22.310> on<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
and I just figured out I went on the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.720 
and I just figured out I went on the
internet<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.720> set<00:05:24.110> up<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.770> bunch<00:05:25.070> of<00:05:25.250> things

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
internet and I set up a bunch of things

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.850 
internet and I set up a bunch of things
that<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.240> can<00:05:26.480> do<00:05:26.600> to<00:05:27.080> help<00:05:27.410> your<00:05:27.590> hair<00:05:27.800> grow

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
long and one of them was to not use a

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.570 
long and one of them was to not use a
brush<00:05:31.070> because<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.790> brush<00:05:32.210> really<00:05:33.050> makes<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.310> lot

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
brush because a brush really makes a lot

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.960

of damage on your hair and it creates a

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.690 
of damage on your hair and it creates a
lot<00:05:38.120> of<00:05:38.150> food<00:05:38.420> items<00:05:38.540> so<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.860> decided<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.580> use

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
lot of food items so I decided to use

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.310

alike to come because this was supposed

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.650 
alike to come because this was supposed
to<00:05:42.350> be<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.500> lot<00:05:42.680> better<00:05:42.890> for<00:05:43.730> it<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:44.210> I<00:05:44.330> really

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
to be a lot better for it and I really

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.860 
to be a lot better for it and I really
am<00:05:44.840> trying<00:05:45.080> to<00:05:45.260> prevent<00:05:45.530> breakage<00:05:45.800> in<00:05:46.310> my<00:05:46.520> hair
