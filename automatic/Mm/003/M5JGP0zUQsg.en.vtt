00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.980
 increasingly intensive management has 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.710
 based on pasture feeding with 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 specific matuous mineral supplementation 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.540
 for each category 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.520
 in relation to the pasture the manager thiago

 Theophilus highlights the rotated system 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.219
 with a hand-picked gram of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.140
 work at brachiaria mg 5 an absurd 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.200
 a way that is not doing so 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.090
 now on this ride he set the pickets 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.300
 rotated with mg 5 and is running 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 face three days running is a way of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 cow at the pickets 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.950
 on the 5th, but plant with one year and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.990
 medium was made the ground operation 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.369
 great action has proved to be a 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.530
 technical is absurd 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.750
 accompanying and explaining to us how 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.900
 is that he had to plant the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.820
 quantity only in the matsuda segment 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.460
 mg 5 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.619
 here is all of madson according to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.290
 an absurd representative in the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.030
 East the donizete entrepreneurship of the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.360
 producer is fundamental in the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.689
 She adopted this farm, she is excellent. 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.829

 making a visit accompanying 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.140
 I believe for this reason that the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.350
 animals are excellent 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.770

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.220
 tanzania, right? 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.410
 not cultivating has a good answer 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.650
 productive when you think it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.050
 intensification that has guided it is 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.580
 passed the products are used was already 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.240

 entrepreneurial producer who brought 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.530
 brought flexibility and good response 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.080

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.250

 mineral supplements and 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.140
 results at the time of this investment 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.780
 thiago is satisfied with the production 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.480

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.510
 with performance of what was invested 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.070
