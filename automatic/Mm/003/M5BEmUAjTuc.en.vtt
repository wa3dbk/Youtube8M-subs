what<00:00:56.579> sets<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.149> cannon<00:00:57.510> apart<00:00:57.839> from<00:00:58.170> many<00:00:58.350> of

what sets this cannon apart from many of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.810 
what sets this cannon apart from many of
the<00:00:58.620> other<00:00:58.710> cannons<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.579> chain

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the other cannons is that it's a chain

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.299 
the other cannons is that it's a chain
gun<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.780> means<00:01:01.079> there's<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.680> few<00:01:01.799> moving

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
gun that means there's very few moving

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820 
gun that means there's very few moving
parts<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.289> which<00:01:04.289> makes<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> very

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
parts in there which makes it a very

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.670 
parts in there which makes it a very
high<00:01:05.280> reliable<00:01:05.970> cannon<00:01:06.500> Bushmaster<00:01:07.500> has

high reliable cannon Bushmaster has
built-in<00:01:08.220> flexibility<00:01:09.000> thanks<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.780> its<00:01:09.930> dual

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
built-in flexibility thanks to its dual

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.429 
built-in flexibility thanks to its dual
feed<00:01:10.680> system<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:12.420> allows<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.140> change

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
feed system this allows you to change

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.789 
feed system this allows you to change
rounds<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.130> flick<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> switch<00:01:15.799> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
rounds at the flick of a switch the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
rounds at the flick of a switch the
reason<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.940> dual<00:01:18.270> feed

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
reason that you want to have dual feed

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.580 
reason that you want to have dual feed
is<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:20.330> typically<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.170> battle

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
is because typically in a battle

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.200 
is because typically in a battle
scenario<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.429> don't<00:01:23.610> know<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:23.940> kind<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
scenario you don't know what kind of

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
scenario you don't know what kind of
targets<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.929> to<00:01:24.990> come<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.319> against<00:01:25.700> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
targets are going to come up against the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.749 
targets are going to come up against the
two<00:01:26.850> types<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> ammunition<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:28.110> most<00:01:28.500> users

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
two types of ammunition that most users

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.010 
two types of ammunition that most users
put<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.880> their<00:01:30.060> systems<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.899> an

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
put on their systems would be an

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
put on their systems would be an
armor-piercing<00:01:31.560> round<00:01:32.039> and<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.670> high

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
armor-piercing round and a high

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.330 
armor-piercing round and a high
explosive<00:01:32.970> round<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.709> the<00:01:34.830> dual<00:01:35.009> feed

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
explosive round and with the dual feed

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219

which are able to do is from the fire

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.249 
which are able to do is from the fire
control<00:01:37.679> system<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.399> switch<00:01:38.850> between<00:01:39.330> which

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
control system is switch between which

range of this facility but the
