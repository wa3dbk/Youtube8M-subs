that<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.990> time<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.590> time<00:01:36.830> has<00:01:37.670> come<00:01:37.700> for

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
that the time this the time has come for

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.980 
that the time this the time has come for
guile<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.840> be<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.020> person<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:40.570> defend<00:01:41.570> the

guile to be the person to defend the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.320 
guile to be the person to defend the
world<00:01:42.170> from<00:01:43.240> sort<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.270> slow-moving<00:01:45.280> evil<00:01:46.330> in

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
world from sort of slow-moving evil in

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.899 
world from sort of slow-moving evil in
this<00:01:47.810> case<00:01:48.049> certainly<00:01:48.400> so<00:01:49.400> that's<00:01:49.580> kind<00:01:49.850> of

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
this case certainly so that's kind of

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.690 
this case certainly so that's kind of
the<00:01:50.810> background<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.650> it<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:51.920> why<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.130> visuals

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the background of it and why the visuals

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.109 
the background of it and why the visuals
look<00:01:52.820> absolutely<00:01:53.540> nothing<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:55.119> Street

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
look absolutely nothing like Street

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.999

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
Fighter or anything by Capcom certainly

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.560 
Fighter or anything by Capcom certainly
the<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.189> animation<00:01:58.909> looks<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.210> little<00:01:59.360> bit

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
the the animation looks a little bit

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.020 
the the animation looks a little bit
like<00:01:59.799> he<00:02:00.799> looks<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.070> bit<00:02:01.100> knockoff<00:02:01.579> doesn't<00:02:01.970> it

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030
