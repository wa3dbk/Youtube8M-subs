00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.730 
unreliable but we put the tapes away the
couple<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.600> days<00:01:04.720> later<00:01:04.750> when<00:01:05.199> we<00:01:05.320> open<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.680> the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
couple of days later when we open up the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.649 
couple of days later when we open up the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
spot but i do remember trying to come up

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.530 
spot but i do remember trying to come up
with<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.770> know<00:02:29.800> solos<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.430> were<00:02:30.670> icy<00:02:31.090> solos

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
with you know solos that were icy solos

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.390 
with you know solos that were icy solos
that<00:02:31.570> were<00:02:31.870> bubbly<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.280> know<00:02:33.370> just

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
that were bubbly and you know just

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.160 
that were bubbly and you know just
trying<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.820> use<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.150> imagery<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.690> i<00:02:34.720> think

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
trying to use that imagery and i think

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.170 
trying to use that imagery and i think
we<00:02:35.290> did<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.710> backwards<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:36.700> i<00:02:36.730> think<00:02:36.970> was

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
we did the backwards so i think was

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.760 
we did the backwards so i think was
actually<00:02:37.480> done<00:02:37.600> down<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.050> hall<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.410> studio<00:02:38.710> D

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
actually done down the hall in studio D

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.180 
actually done down the hall in studio D
it's<00:02:39.700> okay<00:02:40.000> we're<00:02:40.300> not<00:02:40.420> going<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.630> relocate<00:02:43.170> I

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's okay we're not going to relocate I

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.290 
it's okay we're not going to relocate I
think<00:02:45.190> there's<00:02:45.340> somebody<00:02:45.520> working<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.120> there

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
think there's somebody working in there

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.750 
think there's somebody working in there
right<00:02:46.450> now<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.860> but<00:02:48.130> let's<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.340> do<00:02:48.520> why<00:02:48.640> it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
right now so but let's just do why it's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.180 
right now so but let's just do why it's
not<00:02:48.880> for<00:02:49.090> you
