00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.759
 in Guatemala 90% of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.910
 water supplies available for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.059
 the population are contaminated scj water 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.059
 contaminated causes child deaths 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.039
 days away from school work like this 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.460
 as an economic cost for attention 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.140
 medical or purchase of medicines in a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.650
 this water bag can be found 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 from bad smells solid color in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.840
 suspension to bacteria causing 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 Intestinal infections the solution 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.820
 to purify water in guatemala is already 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 a fact with the eco filter the eco filter 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 It is a purifying filter that contains 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.489
 three basic elements carbon mud and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.620
 colloidal silver basic elements for the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.600
 water purification worldwide 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.149
 now let's see how a drop of water 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.360
 polluted passes through the lic or filter and 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.489
 the contaminated boot is purified 100% 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 crosses the micro-channels that have 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 formed in the eco filter and enters 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.879
 contact with material surfaces 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.700
 that has been formed from mud with coal and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.150
 colloidal silver these micro channels are 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.820
 fit 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.640
 for the 10 minutes they tied themselves 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.710
 only some bacteria as well as solids 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 the carbon contained in them 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.350
 eliminate odors colors and flavors 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 finally the colloidal silver for its 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.000
 bacteriostatic activity ends by 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.160
 neutralize the polluting activity of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.730
 the bacteria in the drop comes out of the echo 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.250
 clean filter fresh and purified 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.360
 verifiable in chemistry as well as 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.790
 microbiologically and meets the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.620
 drinking water specifications of the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.140
 Cuban norm that is the commission 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.930
 Guatemalan standards and also meets 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.170
 with international standards 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.479
 I'm almost hwan kim and comfortable and manager 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.220
 laboratory technician controlled one 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.350
 of the most prestigious laboratories of 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.220
 Central America is a control 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.740
 accredited industrial laboratory iso 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.260
 17025 what does this mean that the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 results that we issue on accepted 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.940
 and recognized worldwide as 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.850
 we programmed that something is happening 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.000
 by the push is clean pure and fresh 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.710
 already for several years month to month we evaluate 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.930
 the quality of the eco filters of the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.960
 next way we put water 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.170
 contaminated in the filter and then we do 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.120
 an analysis of the water that comes out of it 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.390
 according to the results we have checked 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.000
 has with filter eliminates 100% 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.830
 bacteria of fecal origin thus ensuring 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.890
 which also eliminates others 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.110
 microorganisms that cause pernada and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.270
 this as well as control and guarantee the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.460
 quality of the eco filters and contributes 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.460
 to produce water suitable for not being human
