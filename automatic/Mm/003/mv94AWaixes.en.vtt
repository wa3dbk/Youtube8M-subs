redness or discoloration in the skin but

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.540 
redness or discoloration in the skin but
it<00:03:39.630> does<00:03:39.840> give<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.500> just<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.860> little<00:03:40.950> extra

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
it does give it just that little extra

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.760 
it does give it just that little extra
boost<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:44.720> color<00:03:45.720> uniformity<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.560> make

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
boost of color uniformity and make

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.170 
boost of color uniformity and make
everything<00:03:47.070> sort<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.490> blend<00:03:47.730> together<00:03:47.880> a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
everything sort of blend together a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.150 
everything sort of blend together a
little<00:03:48.390> bit<00:03:48.600> more<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.500> also<00:03:49.650> does<00:03:49.950> make<00:03:50.130> a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
little bit more it also does make a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.300 
little bit more it also does make a
great<00:03:50.430> base<00:03:50.610> for<00:03:50.640> makeup<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.270> will<00:03:51.450> say<00:03:51.660> that

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
great base for makeup I will say that

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.310 
great base for makeup I will say that
because<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.610> how<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.910> smooths<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.720> skin<00:03:55.080> and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
because of how it smooths the skin and

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.490 
because of how it smooths the skin and
how<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.650> makes<00:03:56.210> everything<00:03:57.210> sort<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.660> look<00:03:58.320> a

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
how it makes everything sort of look a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.240 
how it makes everything sort of look a
little<00:03:58.620> bit<00:03:58.800> better<00:03:58.890> when<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.220> put

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
little bit better when you put

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.250 
little bit better when you put
foundation<00:03:59.550> on<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.090> seems<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.450> apply<00:04:00.750> first<00:04:01.080> of

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
foundation on it seems to apply first of

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
foundation on it seems to apply first of
all<00:04:01.350> very<00:04:01.530> smoothly<00:04:01.920> because<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.640> texture

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
all very smoothly because of the texture

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.810 
all very smoothly because of the texture
of<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.420> product<00:04:03.780> underneath<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:05.250> dream

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
of the product underneath it the dream

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.090 
of the product underneath it the dream
skin<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.960> also<00:04:07.110> seems<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.650> look<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.950> little

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
skin but it also seems to look a little

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.860 
skin but it also seems to look a little
bit<00:04:08.280> better<00:04:08.400> because<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:09.360> don't<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.750> use

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
bit better because you don't have to use

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.110 
bit better because you don't have to use
as<00:04:10.080> much<00:04:10.530> foundation<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.910> skin

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
as much foundation because the skin

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.860 
as much foundation because the skin
underneath<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.750> looks<00:04:13.080> better<00:04:13.740> on<00:04:13.860> its<00:04:14.190> own<00:04:14.870> so

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
underneath it looks better on its own so

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.080 
underneath it looks better on its own so
those<00:04:16.049> are<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.380> two<00:04:16.650> best<00:04:17.340> things<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.940> would

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
those are the two best things I would

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.450 
those are the two best things I would
say<00:04:18.210> about<00:04:18.420> this<00:04:18.630> product<00:04:18.930> now<00:04:19.350> on<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.980> what<00:04:20.220> I

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
say about this product now on to what I

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.060 
say about this product now on to what I
think<00:04:20.520> is<00:04:20.910> kind<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.390> silly<00:04:22.260> about<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.890> dream

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
think is kind of silly about the dream

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.909 
think is kind of silly about the dream
skin<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.880> would<00:04:24.060> have<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.330> say<00:04:24.480> it<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.919> the

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
skin and I would have to say it is the

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.110 
skin and I would have to say it is the
price<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.610> think<00:04:26.910> this

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
price and I think this

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.280 
price and I think this
product<00:04:27.389> is<00:04:27.449> trying<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.810> be<00:04:27.900> too<00:04:28.110> many

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
product is trying to be too many

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.360 
product is trying to be too many
different<00:04:28.710> things<00:04:28.889> too<00:04:29.760> too<00:04:29.940> many<00:04:30.120> people<00:04:30.540> and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
different things too too many people and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.000 
different things too too many people and
it<00:04:32.370> ends<00:04:32.669> up<00:04:32.729> being<00:04:33.030> an<00:04:33.300> overpriced<00:04:34.010> yet

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
it ends up being an overpriced yet

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.909 
it ends up being an overpriced yet
highly<00:04:35.280> adequate<00:04:35.970> product<00:04:36.510> in<00:04:36.720> many<00:04:37.320> areas<00:04:37.560> it

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
highly adequate product in many areas it

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.460 
highly adequate product in many areas it

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
different after I removed this product

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.510 
different after I removed this product
to<00:05:27.930> me<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:28.229> is<00:05:28.380> purely<00:05:28.800> something<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.490> I

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
to me this is purely something that I

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.339 
to me this is purely something that I
would<00:05:29.760> use<00:05:29.940> just<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.720> make<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.050> skin<00:05:31.289> look

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
would use just to make the skin look

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.420 
would use just to make the skin look
nice<00:05:31.820> before<00:05:32.820> putting<00:05:33.060> makeup<00:05:33.330> on<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.800> I

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
nice before putting makeup on and I

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.250 
nice before putting makeup on and I
think<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.940> skin<00:05:36.180> care<00:05:36.360> claims<00:05:36.660> as<00:05:36.900> they<00:05:37.110> are

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
think the skin care claims as they are

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.600 
think the skin care claims as they are
in<00:05:37.500> most<00:05:38.210> color<00:05:39.210> products<00:05:39.840> are<00:05:40.440> very<00:05:41.160> sort<00:05:41.520> of

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
in most color products are very sort of

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.690 
in most color products are very sort of
weak<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.889> don't<00:05:43.889> really<00:05:44.130> hold<00:05:44.430> their<00:05:44.669> own

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
weak and don't really hold their own

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.620 
weak and don't really hold their own
against<00:05:45.360> what<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.139> claims<00:05:46.410> are<00:05:46.940> not<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.450> say

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
against what the claims are not to say

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.659 
against what the claims are not to say
that<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:49.020> care<00:05:49.919> that<00:05:50.070> much<00:05:50.190> because<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.430> lot<00:05:50.639> of

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
that I care that much because a lot of

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.879 
that I care that much because a lot of

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889
