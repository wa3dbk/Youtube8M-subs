your finger up to have that high e able

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.000 
your finger up to have that high e able
to<00:02:21.670> ring<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:23.110> experiment<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:23.769> it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
to ring so you can experiment with it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.619 
to ring so you can experiment with it
it's<00:02:24.190> not<00:02:24.370> wrong<00:02:24.610> if<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.879> want<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.120> bar<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.510> or

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
it's not wrong if you want to bar it or

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.440 
it's not wrong if you want to bar it or
switch<00:02:25.840> those<00:02:26.049> fingers<00:02:26.379> around<00:02:27.269> if<00:02:28.269> your

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
switch those fingers around if your

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.180 
switch those fingers around if your
thumb<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.989> download<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.590> cool<00:02:29.890> if<00:02:30.129> not

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
thumb can you download it cool if not

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.820 
thumb can you download it cool if not
just<00:02:30.580> don't<00:02:30.700> pick<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.019> um<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:32.650> we've<00:02:32.739> got

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
just don't pick it um and then we've got

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
just don't pick it um and then we've got
another<00:02:32.980> measure<00:02:33.370> here<00:02:33.700> hold<00:02:34.239> up<00:02:34.420> four<00:02:34.750> counts

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.750 

and<00:02:38.260> then<00:02:38.380> you're<00:02:38.530> back<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.920> progression

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and then you're back to the progression

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.960 
and then you're back to the progression
so<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.940> progression<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.599> B<00:02:40.780> minor<00:02:41.049> bar<00:02:41.980> G

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
so the progression is B minor bar G

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.569 
so the progression is B minor bar G
major<00:02:43.209> D<00:02:43.599> major<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:45.099> major

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
major D major and a major

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.940 
major D major and a major
and<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:46.870> goes<00:02:47.019> through<00:02:47.319> four<00:02:47.620> times

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
and I think that goes through four times

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.740 
and I think that goes through four times
and<00:02:48.370> that's<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.700> course<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.299> song<00:02:49.480> really

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
and that's the course of the song really

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.559 
and that's the course of the song really

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
integrity behind these and no one gets

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.540 
integrity behind these and no one gets
it<00:04:11.290> 100%<00:04:11.650> right<00:04:12.010> every<00:04:12.250> time

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
it 100% right every time

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.390 
it 100% right every time
I'm<00:04:12.880> not<00:04:13.030> saying<00:04:13.360> that<00:04:13.630> they<00:04:14.080> do<00:04:14.310> even<00:04:15.310> the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
I'm not saying that they do even the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.800 
I'm not saying that they do even the
bands<00:04:15.610> are<00:04:15.790> right<00:04:15.970> up<00:04:16.150> don't<00:04:16.299> get<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.660> hundred

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
bands are right up don't get a hundred

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.550 
bands are right up don't get a hundred
percent<00:04:17.290> every<00:04:17.620> time<00:04:18.209> were<00:04:19.209> only<00:04:19.360> humans<00:04:19.989> we

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
percent every time were only humans we

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.100 
percent every time were only humans we
have<00:04:20.590> flaws<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:21.820> I'm<00:04:21.940> keeping<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.570> true<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.870> to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
have flaws but I'm keeping is true is to

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.050 
have flaws but I'm keeping is true is to
entrust<00:04:23.500> integrity<00:04:24.160> as<00:04:24.310> possibilities

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
entrust integrity as possibilities

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.850 
entrust integrity as possibilities
because<00:04:26.050> anything<00:04:26.410> worth<00:04:26.560> doing<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.800> worth

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
because anything worth doing is worth

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.530 
because anything worth doing is worth
doing<00:04:26.980> right<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.670> until<00:04:27.940> next<00:04:28.090> time<00:04:28.330> keep
