me do specific ways of work with others
that<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.830> their<00:00:20.220> own<00:00:20.340> methods<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.420> going<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
that have their own methods I'm going to

that have their own methods I'm going to
show<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:22.350> method<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.820> use

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
show you my method that I like to use

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.200 
show you my method that I like to use
there's<00:00:25.380> also<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.920> kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.640> bounced<00:00:26.820> around<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
there's also I kind of bounced around a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.849 
there's also I kind of bounced around a
little<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.480> too<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.170> well<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:28.650> sometimes

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
little bit too as well I'm sometimes

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.109 
little bit too as well I'm sometimes
I'll<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.250> digitally<00:00:29.369> sometimes<00:00:29.910> I'll<00:00:30.029> do

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
I'll do it digitally sometimes I'll do

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.170 
I'll do it digitally sometimes I'll do
it<00:00:30.500> practically<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> most<00:00:32.489> parts<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.090> use

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
it practically for the most parts I use

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.930 
it practically for the most parts I use
cards<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:37.140> start<00:00:37.290> my<00:00:37.440> animatic<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.700> my

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
cards to start my animatic or my

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.010 
cards to start my animatic or my
storyboard<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.649> reason<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.730> I

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
storyboard and the reason for this is I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.330 
storyboard and the reason for this is I
get<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> perfect<00:00:43.950> 16<00:00:44.280> by<00:00:44.399> 9<00:00:44.480> aspect<00:00:45.480> ratio<00:00:46.340> so

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
get a perfect 16 by 9 aspect ratio so

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.630 
get a perfect 16 by 9 aspect ratio so
it's<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.579> an<00:00:47.700> HD<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> film<00:00:48.780> aspect<00:00:49.230> ratio

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
it's like an HD or a film aspect ratio

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.119 
it's like an HD or a film aspect ratio
also<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.180> draw<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.840> multiples<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.620> these

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
also I can draw on multiples of these

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.639 
also I can draw on multiples of these
these<00:00:53.520> cards<00:00:53.910> index<00:00:54.270> cards<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.500> got

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
these cards index cards and it's got

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
these cards index cards and it's got
lines<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> back<00:00:56.940> where<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.360> write

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
lines in the back where I can write

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.049 
lines in the back where I can write
notes<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:58.020> need<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.670> other<00:00:59.850> friends

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
notes if need be I have other friends

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.049 
notes if need be I have other friends
and<00:01:00.600> I've<00:01:01.260> done<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.649> well<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.190> sticky

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and I've done this as well as use sticky

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.929 
and I've done this as well as use sticky

and even a ballpoint pen and then I scan
it<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> computer<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.439> then<00:01:25.439> once<00:01:26.280> it's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it into the computer and then once it's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
it into the computer and then once it's
in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> computer<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.960> tweaks<00:01:28.229> and

cards or your pieces of paper scanned
into<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.130> computer<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:42.299> gonna<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
into your computer you're gonna have a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.910 
into your computer you're gonna have a
folder<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.020> course<00:01:43.259> we're<00:01:43.380> gonna<00:01:43.470> place<00:01:43.710> them

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
folder of course we're gonna place them

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
folder of course we're gonna place them
all<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> put<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.329> numerical

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
all you want to put them in numerical

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.550 
all you want to put them in numerical
order<00:01:46.790> numbered<00:01:47.790> order

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.640 

so<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.570> me<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.810> all<00:01:54.930> those<00:01:55.080> suckers<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
so you see me have all those suckers and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.219 
so you see me have all those suckers and
then<00:01:56.130> those<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.580> scanned<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:58.020> course

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
then those get scanned in of course

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.780 
then those get scanned in of course
resolution<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.800> gonna<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.070> different<00:01:59.340> than

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
resolution is gonna be different than

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.510 
resolution is gonna be different than
what<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:01.020> want<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> edit<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.250> you're

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
what you you want to edit in so you're

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.740 
what you you want to edit in so you're
gonna<00:02:02.640> bring<00:02:02.850> them<00:02:03.000> into<00:02:03.120> software<00:02:03.540> like

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
gonna bring them into software like

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.520 
gonna bring them into software like
Photoshop<00:02:03.780> Photoshop<00:02:04.650> essentials<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:06.530> GIMP

software's and you're gonna resize them
so<00:02:13.820> in<00:02:14.820> Photoshop<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.780> basically<00:02:16.230> go<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.380> image

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so in Photoshop I basically go to image

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.050 
so in Photoshop I basically go to image
size<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.370> change<00:02:18.270> my<00:02:18.450> resolution<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.920> 72<00:02:20.340> dpi

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
size and change my resolution to 72 dpi

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.330 
size and change my resolution to 72 dpi
or<00:02:22.250> pixels<00:02:23.250> per<00:02:23.520> inch<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:26.010> I

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
or pixels per inch and then then I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.120 
or pixels per inch and then then I
change<00:02:26.790> my<00:02:27.120> width<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.840> my<00:02:27.930> height<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.410> 1280<00:02:28.950> by

doing animatics and storyboards yeah
and<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.390> easier<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> computers

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
and it's it's easier on the computers

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.710 
and it's it's easier on the computers
you<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.370> actually<00:02:41.820> do<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> whole<00:02:42.180> feature<00:02:42.300> film
