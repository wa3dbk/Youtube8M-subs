00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:24.958
When people think of the slums, most of the time they think about violence.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.127
About what's wrong here.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:31.131
In some cases, they might think about culture.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.466
That's cool.  We got music and dance.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.437
But there's something else going on here.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.305
Cooking talent.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:49.315
So today, lemme tell you that we're going to talk about some amazing stuff.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:53.253
Delicious stuff.  Food.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:01:00.493
We're here at Dona Concei豪o's house to learn how to make fish in coconut milk.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.830
C'mon in.  Let's see the ingredients.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.476
G'Morning, Dona Ce溝.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.710
Now's when I have to talk?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.516
Can you tell us a little about how you make Peixe ao Coco?

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:27.787
We've got a load of spices, garlic,

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:31.858
Cumin, seasoning salt,

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:37.163
Lime.  And then the veggie: tomato, onion, bell peppers.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.267
And coconut, of course.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.472
Now we'll watch Dona Ce溝 in action, so that all of you at home...

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.341
so you can see how she does it.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.010
But when she's done, you'll just be watching, and I get to eat it!

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.718
Preparing the Fish

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:07.260
First with the fish, you have to clean out the guts, drain the blood.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.531
And after it's all clean, marinate it in lime.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:13.967
The lime cleans it even more.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.507
Squeezing the lime.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:30.416
The lime exposes the fish.  It lets you know what it really taste like.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.452
Then kosher salt.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:51.971
If you wash the sink with clothes detergent, the flies won't come.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:56.409
So I clear with soap, and then sprinkle detergent.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:04.050
Helpful hint to keep flies out of your kitchen!

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:12.192
Now it's time for the salt.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.405
More lime.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:37.550
In the countryside, I learned to do it this way.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.055
So it cooks deep, you do this.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.657
You see?

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:48.394
It will fry all the way through.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:56.269
After it's well fried, we'll use cilantro, tomato, onion, bell peppers...

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.303
cumin,

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.339
seasoned salt, urucum powder.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.506
Garlic.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.712
That's when I'll make the coconut milk in the blender.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:11.351
When all the flavors are mixed, we'll taste it during lunch.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.826
Black eyed peas

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.799
I learned to cook with my mother.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:34.574
She was working, and she took me to the house where she worked as a maid.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:40.613
There in the master's house, she told me,

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.749
"Now I'll show you how to make rice..."

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.385
I was eight years old.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:54.260
And by the time I was nine, I could cook many things.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.866
Plus, when she was working, she left us at home, so I had to learn.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:03.970
Beans, rice, beef.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.474
She had to work to bring food home for us.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:16.783
So when I was 10 or 11, I was already in charge of my life.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.053
That was in the countryside where she taught me.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:25.525
And when I came to Recife to work, I could see why she taught me.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:29.896
She said, "If you work as a maid,

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:33.900
at least you'll know how to make food like I do."

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:39.572
"There, you can do what I taught you."

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.109
That's what I learned, and I'm still using that knowledge.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.334
If you want to make black eyes peas in the pressure cooker, you can.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:12.205
but I've found that under pressure, they get way too soft,

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.574
because of the pressure.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:17.877
So it's better to cook in the normal pot.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:22.849
That way, you can observe how it's cooking.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.717
If it is soft.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:28.855
But in the pressure cooker, by the time you look, it's already too late.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:31.290
This way, you eat it just right.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.092
You get the right taste.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:38.898
Next week, we see how she cooks the rest... and we eat!
