 good i am the jackal this is my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.120
 first video based on a program that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.040
 is to brighten the monitor for the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.630
 games more than anything for the cs the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 dark parts where one can not have 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250
 is a very simple program the link of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.860
 download I'll leave it in the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.050
 description of the video here on youtube 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.870
 what I'm going to do is install it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.100
 so that everyone can see how it is done 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.750
 click on the link will appear 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.180
 this window give you to download once 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.180
 we hope a little bit we give to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.890
 download again 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.890
 we hope the download begins 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.000
 will start the installation now 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.650
 and I 'll take it back is very easy to 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.330
 use 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.570
 and I'm going to install them for you 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.570
 I see it 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.600
 we hope that the download started is a 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.109
 bit slow by the video recording 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 it seems we can accept these things 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.379
 we always have to put that not 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.839
 they are programs that if they are in the machine 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.390
 that we do not use and some that come with 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.970
 viruses are installed in the browser and what 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.649
 they slow down we put next to 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.400
 charge is going to appear another we put him not 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:19.830
 next grace and it is installed 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.170
 you do not start doing the download 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.170
 good luckily it's going fast 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.399
 here we put next install 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 I already told them not only I have installed 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.799
 but I 'm going to install it so that you 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.799
 see so they can see how it's done 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.830
 we already have the itaca program as health 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.520
 and already I once installed as you saw 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.410
 what did i do 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.260
 we double- click it will open the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.900
 window 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.750
 we put you start so that the program 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.760
 work 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.520
 here is going to appear so process had it to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.070
 you are going to look like this come here 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.890
 they give to cancel that part for the part 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.110
 of range 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.120
 and since I already did other tests in the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.399
 video are not going to realize that it goes up 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.970
 the brightness but if it goes up then 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.380
 they have to come here to gamma and upload it 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.600
 you will not notice it because the video 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 it does not show that part of you go up the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.400
 shine but when you do it they go 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.830
 to realize that if you go up what 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.830
 you see necessary, they are testing 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.989
 about twice to climb the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.850
 obviously your monitor's brightness 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.730
 that of the games that plays more than 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.280
 nothing for the cs is very simple once 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.150
 who chose how much they will raise him 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.010
 they give ok 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.379
 they give ok they cancel it from the tip 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.019
 he opens his game and that's it 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.030
 simple I hope you have served them the 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.409
