00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.850 

I've<00:00:00.329> been<00:00:00.539> real<00:00:00.780> busy<00:00:00.810> gearing<00:00:01.469> up<00:00:01.800> for

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I've been real busy gearing up for

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.640 
I've been real busy gearing up for
grafting<00:00:02.580> season<00:00:03.090> but<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.689> did<00:00:03.929> have<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.319> little

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
grafting season but I did have a little

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.829 
grafting season but I did have a little
bit<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.799> time<00:00:05.100> today<00:00:05.370> or<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:05.970> took<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> little<00:00:06.600> bit

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
bit of time today or I took a little bit

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.610 
bit of time today or I took a little bit
of<00:00:06.930> time<00:00:07.140> today<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.649> guess<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.580> play<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.300> bit<00:00:09.660> and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
of time today I guess to play a bit and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.980 
of time today I guess to play a bit and
now<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.490> what<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.820> got<00:00:12.000> done<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.360> took<00:00:12.660> this

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
now this is what we got done I took this

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.440 
now this is what we got done I took this
to<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.380> friend<00:00:13.679> who's<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.400> professional<00:00:15.240> welder

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
to my friend who's a professional welder

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.710 
to my friend who's a professional welder
or<00:00:15.929> was<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.590> many<00:00:16.770> many<00:00:17.010> years<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.720> has

or was for many many years and has

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.550 
or was for many many years and has
welded<00:00:19.199> cast<00:00:19.590> quite<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.170> he<00:00:22.170> had<00:00:22.320> some

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
welded cast quite a lot and he had some

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.810 
welded cast quite a lot and he had some
nickel<00:00:22.920> rod<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.689> kind<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> just

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
nickel rod and and I kind of just

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.189 
nickel rod and and I kind of just
assisted<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> nurse<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.689> during<00:00:28.109> an

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
assisted like a nurse you know during an

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.890 
assisted like a nurse you know during an
operation<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.220> had<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> cut<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.779> all

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
operation and I had to cut first of all

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
operation and I had to cut first of all
we<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.529> put<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> wood<00:00:32.189> stove<00:00:32.610> he<00:00:32.790> built

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
we we put it on the wood stove he built

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.520 
we we put it on the wood stove he built
a<00:00:33.149> fire<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.660> laid<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.020> thing<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> wood

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a fire we laid this thing on the wood

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.580 
a fire we laid this thing on the wood
stove<00:00:34.800> got<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> pretty<00:00:36.059> warm<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:37.170> we

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
stove got it pretty warm and then we

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
stove got it pretty warm and then we
commenced<00:00:37.980> working<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.790> well<00:00:39.780> yeah

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
commenced working on it and well yeah

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
commenced working on it and well yeah
well<00:00:40.800> did<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.960> he<00:00:42.960> welded<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.950> should<00:00:44.160> say<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
well did this he welded I should say I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.029 
well did this he welded I should say I
didn't<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.789> anything<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.600> he

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
didn't have anything to do with it he

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.900 
didn't have anything to do with it he
welded<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.219> baffle<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.820> know

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
welded my baffle in there and you know

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.250 
welded my baffle in there and you know
we<00:00:51.059> don't<00:00:51.180> care<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.110> bit<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
we don't care if there's a little bit of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
we don't care if there's a little bit of
crack<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.949> leak<00:00:53.100> he's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> matter<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.760> fact<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
crack or leak he's a matter of fact I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
crack or leak he's a matter of fact I
heard<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.620> guy<00:00:55.800> say<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> drill<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> hole

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
heard one guy say that you drill a hole

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.430 
heard one guy say that you drill a hole
in<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> equalize<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.719> pressure<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
in there to equalize the pressure I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.130 
in there to equalize the pressure I
don't<00:00:59.219> quite<00:00:59.579> follow<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.870> if

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
don't quite follow that because if

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
don't quite follow that because if
you've<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.320> fitting<00:01:01.829> headers<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.370> there

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you've got fitting headers on there

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.090 
you've got fitting headers on there
there's<00:01:02.940> no<00:01:03.120> equalizing<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.870> pressure

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
there's no equalizing the pressure

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's no equalizing the pressure
unless<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.339> equalize<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> pipe

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
unless you equalize it in the pipe

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
unless you equalize it in the pipe
somewhere<00:01:06.689> believe<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> headers<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.220> suppose

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
somewhere believe the headers I suppose

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.950 
somewhere believe the headers I suppose
but<00:01:09.770> anyway<00:01:10.939> that's<00:01:11.939> beside<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> point

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
but anyway that's beside the point

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.530 
but anyway that's beside the point
I<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.740> gonna<00:01:13.950> explain<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.640> did<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.270> for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
I was gonna explain how we did this for

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.120 
I was gonna explain how we did this for
how<00:01:15.689> he<00:01:15.750> did<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.409> put<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> heat<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
how he did this put it on the heat and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.649 
how he did this put it on the heat and
stove<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> he<00:01:17.729> got<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> warmed<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.420> pretty

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
stove and he got it warmed up pretty

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.440 
stove and he got it warmed up pretty
good<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.320> mean<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.220> too<00:01:20.369> hot<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.580> touch<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
good I mean it was too hot to touch and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.530 
good I mean it was too hot to touch and
what<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> read<00:01:22.799> about<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.520> four<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.360> five

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
what I read about that is four or five

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.890 
what I read about that is four or five
hundred<00:01:24.720> degrees<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:27.439> we<00:01:28.439> had<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> cup

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
hundred degrees and then we had a cup

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
hundred degrees and then we had a cup
you<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.200> cutting<00:01:31.530> torch<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.390> thing

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you know the cutting torch on this thing

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.800 
you know the cutting torch on this thing
and<00:01:33.960> kept<00:01:34.290> heating<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.799> kept<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.790> hot<00:01:36.299> here

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and kept heating it kept it hot here

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.929 
and kept heating it kept it hot here
where<00:01:37.049> where<00:01:37.680> he<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:38.009> doing<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> work<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
where where he was doing the work and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.590 
where where he was doing the work and
then<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:40.970> because<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> heat<00:01:42.240> wants

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
then out this way because the heat wants

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600 
then out this way because the heat wants
to<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> cooler<00:01:43.680> part<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
to go out to the cooler part and and

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
to go out to the cooler part and and
from<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> read<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.509> sometimes<00:01:48.750> crack

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
from what I read it can sometimes crack

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.690 
from what I read it can sometimes crack
somewhere<00:01:49.829> other<00:01:49.979> than<00:01:50.100> where<00:01:50.490> you're

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
somewhere other than where you're

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.420 
somewhere other than where you're
getting<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.390> hot<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> welding<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.220> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
getting it hot and welding on it but it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.179 
getting it hot and welding on it but it
flowed<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:54.119> good<00:01:54.470> because<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.829> said<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
flowed pretty good because he said it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
flowed pretty good because he said it
was<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:56.790> preheated<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:58.649> rod

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
was because it was preheated that rod

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.999 
was because it was preheated that rod
just<00:01:59.189> floated<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.700> there<00:01:59.790> real<00:02:00.000> nice<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.009> then

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
just floated in there real nice and then

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980 
just floated in there real nice and then
he<00:02:02.130> had<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.520> right<00:02:02.759> behind<00:02:02.939> him<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.540> soon<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.840> he

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
he had me right behind him as soon as he

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
he had me right behind him as soon as he
dwelled<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.409> little<00:02:04.680> stretch<00:02:04.979> he<00:02:05.280> had<00:02:05.430> me<00:02:05.579> come

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
dwelled a little stretch he had me come

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
dwelled a little stretch he had me come
in<00:02:05.969> with<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> hammer<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.659> peanut<00:02:07.200> start

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
in with a hammer and peanut start

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.469 
in with a hammer and peanut start
painting<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:09.000> still<00:02:09.239> red<00:02:09.450> hot

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
painting that well it was still red hot

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.180 
painting that well it was still red hot
and<00:02:10.550> what<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.580> read<00:02:11.819> about<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and what I read about that was this

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.490 
and what I read about that was this
that<00:02:14.849> keeps<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:16.099> well<00:02:17.099> from<00:02:17.750> shrinking<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that keeps that well from shrinking up I

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.720 
that keeps that well from shrinking up I
guess<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:21.530> kind<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.590> expands<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.400> when

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
guess and it kind of expands that when

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.750 
guess and it kind of expands that when
you<00:02:23.989> when<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.170> peen<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.220> that's<00:02:26.550> what<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
you when you peen that so that's what I

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.339 
you when you peen that so that's what I
was<00:02:27.000> done<00:02:27.209> with<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> sharp<00:02:27.750> pointed<00:02:28.080> hammer

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
was done with the sharp pointed hammer

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.650 
was done with the sharp pointed hammer
is<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.890> around<00:02:29.099> following<00:02:29.940> him<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.450> every

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
is going around following him and every

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
is going around following him and every
time<00:02:30.870> he'd<00:02:31.019> weld<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.410> stretch<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.310> there

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
time he'd weld a stretch I get in there

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.670 
time he'd weld a stretch I get in there
while<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.819> was<00:02:32.910> still<00:02:33.150> red<00:02:33.330> hot<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:34.349> start

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
while it was still red hot and start

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.490 
while it was still red hot and start
painting<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:37.250> anyway<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:39.239> done

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
painting that out and anyway it's done

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.000 
painting that out and anyway it's done
and<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.739> didn't<00:02:41.010> crack<00:02:41.310> at<00:02:41.610> least<00:02:41.870> yet<00:02:43.010> you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
and it didn't crack at least yet you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.120 
and it didn't crack at least yet you
know<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.849> if<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.079> does<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.530> does<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:47.010> know

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
know and if it does it does you know

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.870 
know and if it does it does you know
it's<00:02:47.280> no<00:02:47.430> big<00:02:47.459> deal

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
it's no big deal

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390 
it's no big deal

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
after I put it on there and it made last

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.110 
after I put it on there and it made last
longer<00:03:11.579> than<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.849> do

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
longer than I do

longer than I do
we'll<00:03:12.450> see<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:12.989> anyway<00:03:13.739> there<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.489> just
