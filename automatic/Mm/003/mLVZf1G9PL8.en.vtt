expected that I speed is a little
fashion<00:00:59.339> expecting<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.120> brakes<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.600> better

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pretty well the one thing is if you look

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.910 
pretty well the one thing is if you look
at<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> river<00:01:07.050> mirror<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:07.710> there's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
at the river mirror I think there's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
at the river mirror I think there's
supposed<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.310> near<00:01:08.640> their<00:01:08.850> name<00:01:09.060> sure<00:01:09.479> but

supposed to be near their name sure but

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.830 
supposed to be near their name sure but
look<00:01:10.050> which<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.740> don't<00:01:10.800> know<00:01:11.300> there's<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.479> thing

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
look which I don't know there's a thing

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.819 
look which I don't know there's a thing
in<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:13.020> center<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> window<00:01:13.649> where

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
in the center of the window where

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.789 
in the center of the window where
there's<00:01:13.979> nothing<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:15.079> it<00:01:16.079> might<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
there's nothing there it might just have

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
there's nothing there it might just have
like<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.070> rear<00:01:17.630> camera<00:01:18.630> thing<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:21.380> overall

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
like a rear camera thing I think overall

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.520
