00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.990
 what do you think of pancho very good to all 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.610
 welcome to a new video we are 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.259
 here in the room because as I said 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.150
 few know that dates are approaching 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.159
 Christmas and we are going to do a lot of 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.480
 little gifts recently we brought you one as 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.330
 you know this time we bring you link no 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.500
 we have a gift from the hand of 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.970
 have mean that I think you will like 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.370
 a lot and it is this capturing that is going to 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.690
 take sofía now and you can take it 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.180
 it is the last one that they have taken and 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.610
 possibly the best for good what 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.500
 typical records 1080 60 frames per 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.429
 second I am could be opening the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.899
 while and record by usb 3.0 there is 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.510
 say that this capturing gravel and 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.730
 long just bone is amazing how well 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.440
 that goes is very good honestly that is 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.600
 yes it is true that it requires the best 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.300
 of a good team, nothing of the other world 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.370
 but here you have a better a laptop 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.530
 very very very very bad and old because 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.850
 better you do not take a shot, it's a catch 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.069
 now that for example is compatible with 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.120
 other programs so they do not have to 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.039
 see with those of having half you know 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.960
 compatible so if you have another one it 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.909
 It adapts perfectly and you can record and 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.379
 what is said is more cool I am seeing 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.090
 here the sofía pajamas and what happens with 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.870
 the shopping pajamas with cables and let's go 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.120
 to see what it was 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.520
 / the typical thing that matters is the capture 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.870
 She is very young as I say she has not 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.310
 captured at the same time mean that we have 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.540
 given so that we can cut between 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.340
 you good the draw is very 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.530
 simple as always, you have in the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.880
 description a link that will take you 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.140
 to twitter but it will not be like always 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.700
 because this time we are going to make a 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.110
 question is worth simply to see if 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.090
 you have entered us a little bit of good is 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.430
 very easy to participate this time can 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.050
 participate so much in twitter knowingly 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.330
 or physical as in the comments of 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.400
 video you just have to answer 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.960
 how many frames does the capture recorder 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.960
 It is very simple 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.190
 commenting on youtube or giving retweet and 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.200
 continuing to see media in the description 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.350
 and then answering in that same 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 tweet and then the solution is not so 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.660
 simple like that I'm going to take off my face 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.070
 another thing that has also is that good 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.840
 lately all of them have already 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.820
 you know that it allows you to record your voice in 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.170
 direct be while you're recording if 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.460
 you have the micro connected as well 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.679
 it records your voice and it leaves you already 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.510
 synchronized which comes in handy for 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.900
 then do not mess around with where the 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.549
 voice where the video goes 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.680
 that everything is perfectly to say that 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.170
 is compatible with more than that comes 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.650
 great and it is essential that you have 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.079
 a usb 3.0 voucher is the minimum if you do not 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.860
 you can not use it is the only 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:30.349
 hit but good if you have it vsb 3.0 and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.230
 you have a computer so present or not 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.299
 any get the basics 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.000
 you can use this capture so 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:42.379
 nothing like I always say applies to 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.200
 portable though it's a laptop 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.200
 Too bad the 2002 well maybe 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.540
 it is not something current because yes another thing I 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.670
 I have the most use is the portable live 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.379
 it's called not if you leave it for me it's a 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.209
 of the best I also the 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.129
 I recommend if you are if you do not have to what 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.739
 better to record in 3.08 is the one that 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.480
 I recommend that it is here that the 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.930
 you are seeing and you will see something but good 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.930
 I have it there 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:21.160
 in total acquisition pole register 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.550
 and video so it's born compatible see 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.550
 works 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:35.730
 if I was French here as the utility 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:40.630
 diagnostic usb a little evolution 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.000
 of Portuguese as compatible with 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.459
 software video test de gràcia or seven 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.019
 points included I go extreme sentence 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.019
 resolution support 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.390
 would be in Portuguese what guys said 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.130
 you have everything in the description if you want 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.080
 participate, Christmas arrives and it shows 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.150
 because I am in my pajamas at home 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.260
 note that you are seeing has little tree 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.560
 Christmas is that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.269
 it shows that we are at Christmas and what 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.819
 said let's have many gifts for 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.739
 raffle since at this time to me 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.180
 like to bring you these little things and to 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.630
 participate what you have to answer 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.930
 that 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.700
 frames records the capturer in 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.230
 youtube and then on twitter the more 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.120
 you do it or if you do it with both 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.950
 networks so much better more possibilities 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.720
 and if you give many more retweet some 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.760
 so ages retweets and answers to twizy 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.870
 continue to see media and if you put it in 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.310
 youtube you have up to four 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.670
 possibilities so the more you 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.260
 make it clearer that if you do one 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.700
 psyche much better so nothing guys 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
 I have said it from here to thank 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.270
 see average as long as they behave very 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.660
 well they always leave us captures for 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.370
 try them to be able to overcome this solution 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.370
 also the pancho that the call 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.490
