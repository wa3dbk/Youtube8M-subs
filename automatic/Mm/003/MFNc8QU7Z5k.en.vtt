00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.860
 Here you see the Samsung Wave 2 and I show you the internet function of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.290
 The device is supported by jean-pierre 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.760
 Staelens Barbara two point 0 o'clock in the TFH St PR and w-lan with the newest 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.140
 n-standard 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.670
 more and there is the DS a human is the right on the page 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.019
 and if I do it with one finger 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.109
 then I have the problems to unlock the device I had to go right 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.279
 wipe over it 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.279
 closed with it around the cup gate 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.150
 I did that now 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.600
 and now i'll show you the internet-browser I'll push in sooner 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.840
 the middle of the gaped commotion at the annual program Internet Round 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.720
 City name to the browser 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.150
 which is now first Samsung EDS launched the networks possibility 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.450
 News radio plays sculptor and and so on and so forth themes screensaver 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.850
 Wallpaper and so far down to shop 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.229
 but he does not want that 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.939
 we now go to a page more on www mobile - in Zibung de 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.050
 So the page already saved 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.960
 So sites are loading from this and that gives a very very fix as you can see 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 can 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.480
 so we have multi fact so pinch-to-zoom the percent Jaskolka over 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.250
 the site works smoothly 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.300
 and some impeccable 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.390
 with Exit Stars off so it's a good plus one more year ago 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.000
 one-gigahertz processor he summer round that works really good critically 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.950
 Proximity one gets to feel the percent 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.300
 yes what do we have many options we have left here for the first time 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.840
 Possibilities to add favorites 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.780
 then we can give another one here the profit or the side 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.990
 To update 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.370
 The ears are currently hot that means when you go to the internet 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.430
 If you have moved between the pages you can navigate around these three 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.539
 Show points and doubts if they are without trouble we can call the home page 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.250
 send this rest 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.580
 every year 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.310
 and in March message or e-mail we can text both on the page 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.550
 Filter images or make Internet settings 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.889
 but finally again and then we have the opportunity here 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.039
 to call our favorites 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.279
 and we have autumn now 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.699
 so call now a new percent would like to open clearly to new ones 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.469
 what can I do a few times 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.269
 and then I can jump back and forth between the crabs 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.269
 why but what if value want to close its fat 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.749
 then we should turn right into the corner 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.829
 that works fine so now i want to show you again i 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.930
 have more time now 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.130
 and Enke okay i have time heart open there i want this tent 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.840
 shut down 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.329
 you push Sachs 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.959
 UN de view of his stock market is closed so there is always one 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.540
 few combination problems as i find one has this button where you always get 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.199
 comes back to the homescreen 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.159
 and you may use this one or the other times wrong then we have 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.449
 this back that I'm more concerned with the sixth 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.040
 So here is always not clear 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.890
 in which directions shooters arrived and Schiesser was the whole 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.070
 internet browser yes as you can see that the team works otherwise 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.420
 will be very good pinch-to-zoom we can now talk about that 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 so move the page 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.969
 that's a nice experience 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.839
 the conversation is very big you can read very well we can tilt the unit 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:20.890
 hold so 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.960
 think more who thinks really nice surf experience I want it 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.650
 but look how it works if I am a youtube video starter 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.859
 our page 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.900
 and there we see that we are being guided instead of that 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.659
 Video starts is you on it again 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.659
 and we guess for a moment what happens 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.479
 now the device needs a little bit 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.129
 Let's get ten million of them redirected to YouTube 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.000
 not really but he should that you directly 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.979
 play from the side 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.279
 so now I am here and if I wanted to watch the video now 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.859
 then I will start his YouTube Play all 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.439
 so complained 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.439
 now the video starts here I have the line at that time 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.299
 and then I can pause back and forth here 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.759
 there is not around here I can rewind from and then I have here 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.759
 further settings can be made 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.469
 so much to the internet functions more videos are available on www Handy - Hansi 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.909
