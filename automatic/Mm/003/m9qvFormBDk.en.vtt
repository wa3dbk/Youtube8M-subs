necessarily going to be the thing that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.809 
necessarily going to be the thing that
we<00:01:33.869> did<00:01:34.080> just<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> logistics<00:01:35.729> and

you<00:01:42.600> definitely<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> jump<00:01:43.800> on<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you definitely have to jump on it

reprieve of you know the emotion that I
was<00:03:25.550> feeling<00:03:26.560> throughout<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.740> whole<00:03:27.920> day

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
was feeling throughout the whole day

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.540 
was feeling throughout the whole day
some<00:03:28.970> high<00:03:29.120> fives<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.690> definitely<00:03:30.050> some<00:03:30.320> like

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
some high fives and definitely some like

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.190 
some high fives and definitely some like
the<00:03:31.550> sense<00:03:31.820> of<00:03:31.910> accomplishment<00:03:32.150> but<00:03:32.840> very

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
the sense of accomplishment but very

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.040 
the sense of accomplishment but very
short-lived<00:03:33.590> because<00:03:34.310> as<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:35.030> said<00:03:35.240> it<00:03:35.900> was

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
short-lived because as I said it was

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.090 
short-lived because as I said it was
only<00:03:36.260> part<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.860> journey<00:03:38.440> you're<00:03:39.440> not<00:03:39.620> done
