00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.449
 I find you today as you 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.510
 have seen it for a video comes from 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.730
 print demonstration of the bottom of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 stained march expensive globus is not open 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.380
 I really waited for this video for 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 to test it or what I just do not have in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.180
 store be chief I took the hue 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.100
 mont blanc so these attacks if the most 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.950
 clear of the range continues there is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 really is really pink and I'm not 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.170
 no perfume and the non-comedogenic and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.719
 it must be here so I was here the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.120
 this is an amount that counts six 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.129
 years 30 milliliters of products with a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.390
 cap a little m like these what what 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 is a bit boring it's that this one 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.829
 is not to complain about the pump I do not 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.980
 know more how much does it cost you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.719
 see aunt well produce on board as 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.049
 that's like I told you this is the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.700
 Aunt Mont Blanc and then we will start 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.890
 a little bit softer but for 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.360
 that you see then I always have the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.670
 dyed as white as usual 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.590
 the only difference is that I have 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.540
 freckles that comes out when 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.119
 start to come out with the sun 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.009
 I 'm going to apply myself to the master this 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.560
 by small touches as usual 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.630
 you see people but not 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.580
 in fact I think you do and I 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.640
 do this by moving ours is part 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.640
 m 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.830
 the texture is 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.270
 indeed creamy even sealer gers is 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.980
 particular but I like so I 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.410
 have you summarized that a bit for you 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.380
 see what I think is that 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.720
 the texture is very nice really the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.540
 blue color is perfect for me i this 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.970
 that I really like it is that it does not 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.710
 not freckle my freckles 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.420
 and leaves the appearance of minor skin 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.480
 so even if current year I find 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.179
 that and mud it at my level 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.160
 beginning I think it's a bit 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.100
 more than light anyway I would not say 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.770
 medium or strong no longer low means yesterday 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.690
 weak snowed forge not if you see this 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.580
 that I want to say to the skin is sweet there 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.690
 that it is natural anyway I find 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.700
 it's a semi-matte rendering for semi 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.840
 matte because still I find that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.810
 this is not in me since the end 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.349
 but not dull because as do 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:44.379
 indeed you have areas ELV 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:48.400
 natural who are glowy so who are 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.349
 bright and 13:48 now 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.450
 joker I'm going to get 40 I'm going 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.370
 no powder and I will not wear makeup 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.780
 especially the more we end up 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.620
 the time of the happy blow we end up 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.019
 much later 17:10 so what I 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.470
 can say it is that it does not have too much 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.590
 shake 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.310
 frankly i find that for a gt 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.140
 and cushions and so on 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.280
 I think it did not move too much 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.069
 trend is always the same 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.819
 that's it if I can just have a little 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.140
 default is that I think it takes 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.750
 powder a little bit when we 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.590
 applied at least on the zone the zone 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.390
 peace but otherwise I like them a lot 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.160
 texture of the coverage like Thursday and 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.690
 slight low average if you can 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.260
 to say that like that I think he is 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.660
 pretty natural I mean we see but 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.450
 my freckles I'm going to you 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.069
 show it in pens so that you see 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.260
 a little bit more rendering for that 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.040
 that's pretty natural because we 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.489
 do not even say a leaven 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.989
 see the skin texture 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.250
 well, if we do not put the rector too much 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.200
 no more stuck on what we see 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.180
 some imperfections high school students when 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.370
 even a pretty natural enough pretty 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.739
 I will pass a quick review 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.569
 firstly the positive aspects like 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.310
 I told you I find it bright I 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.859
 find it a natural yet will not say 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.470
 not when we see the texture the color 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.930
 for my part if you have very mud 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.360
 very very white like me the damage 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.080
 at mont blanc is perfect for especially 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.199
 we will say for the pink tones I find 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.960
 it has a very good performance because 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:37.539
 he matter does not move does not 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.610
 does not oxidize there is no discomfort 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.810
 nevertheless I would have two small three 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.419
 things to report 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.360
 good price then the little point 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.250
 negative but who can arrange it is 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.560
 there is no pump packaging 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.110
 is very good we will not lie to each other 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.889
 mean that is to say positive and negative 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.470
 his pocket 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.210
 I think it depends on the legs 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.830
 that I sincerely believe that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.229
 powder and a little bit less not 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.840
 a lot about the area were so here 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.000
 for my opinion first impressions on 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.500
 the same me thatcher globe denard 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.210
 I hope in any case that this video 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.760
 you will please do not hesitate to tell me if 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.160
 you know this foundation what 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.139
 you think level of a coverage 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.539
 kept on you and I add a 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.300
 last little thing that's off topic 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:28.120
 of this video if you see prices 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.630
 but one or two videos 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.240
 who are going a little changed it's 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.889
 normal in fact I'm trying to 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.020
 test a little bit how I can 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.320
 improve the quality the assembly of 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.730
 video games 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.830
 I am someone who likes the 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.620
 change so if I think I 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.380
 will play some intro and some 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.330
 forms of videos that I know will create 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.360
 select and that from time to time 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.430
 I will change to be here 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.890
 category or be randomly for 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.840
 what for you and for me it can 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.090
 to be as nice to have a little bit 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.760
 of changes a little bit of dynamism 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.110
 like that in the videos here 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.150
 this change you find that it is 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.280
 positive or not is what you think 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.300
 also from the intro and the end of this 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.370
 video it would make me really happy 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.900
 because I spent a lot of 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.680
 saint sernin time so go ahead 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.940
 not to say it 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.650
 and if you liked this video 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.000
 do not hesitate to put a little I will 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.280
