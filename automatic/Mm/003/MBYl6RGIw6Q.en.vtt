00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
without having to type in any type of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.049 
without having to type in any type of
pin<00:00:43.770> code<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.219> most<00:00:44.340> people<00:00:44.460> tend<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> type

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
pin code I know most people tend to type

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.869 
pin code I know most people tend to type
in<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.500> four<00:00:46.500> zeros<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.309> type<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.700> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
in a four zeros to just type it in so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.580 
in a four zeros to just type it in so
now<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.059> don't<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> type<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> anything<00:00:49.050> as

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
now we don't have to type in anything as

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.310 
now we don't have to type in anything as
far<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.950> pin<00:00:50.129> code<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.320> get

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
far as a pin code what you do is get

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.569 
far as a pin code what you do is get
your<00:00:52.379> phone<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:53.449> want<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> add<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> new<00:00:54.870> device

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
your phone on want to add a new device

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.709 
your phone on want to add a new device
so<00:00:56.579> now<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> vehicle<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.149> ready<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.449> accept

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
so now the vehicle is ready to accept

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.240 
so now the vehicle is ready to accept
the<00:00:57.870> vehicle<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> device<00:00:59.489> we<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:01.039> go<00:01:02.039> into

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the vehicle to a device we go in go into

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
the vehicle to a device we go in go into
bluetooth<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.760> our<00:01:02.850> phone<00:01:03.260> we<00:01:04.260> find<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
bluetooth on our phone we find the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
bluetooth on our phone we find the
correct<00:01:04.769> vehicle<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:08.750> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
correct vehicle we see it down there you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
correct vehicle we see it down there you
start<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> let<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> pair<00:01:10.760> now<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.060> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
start to let a pair now we see that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
start to let a pair now we see that
they've<00:01:12.420> recognized<00:01:12.930> each<00:01:13.110> other<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
they've recognized each other the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
they've recognized each other the
vehicles<00:01:14.700> automatically<00:01:15.210> generate<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> random

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
vehicles automatically generate a random

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
vehicles automatically generate a random
pin<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:17.130> checked<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> pin<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.759> both<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
pin I just checked the pin on both the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
pin I just checked the pin on both the
device<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> vehicle<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.229> say<00:01:19.920> okay<00:01:20.189> on

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
device and the vehicle I say okay on

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.270 
device and the vehicle I say okay on
both<00:01:21.320> they're<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.439> connecting<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> last

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
both they're now connecting and the last

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.469 
both they're now connecting and the last
step<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> wants<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
step is going to be that it wants to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
step is going to be that it wants to
know<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.960> features<00:01:25.350> I'd<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> enable<00:01:25.950> so
