00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.320
 well for the doubts that had 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.519
 about the product this kabuki I'm going to 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.830
 teach a little more or less that is 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.660
 why or between what do you say that if it is 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 a viral that if a thousand stories and is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 the age then well we miss a little 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.400
 so you can see this pretty much how 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.140
 it works that has no mystery 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.779
 this would simply buy it a page 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.080
 web and I wanted to show how it worked 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.970
 plus 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.160
 basically what is the end here this 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.160
 it is a very similar special herb of 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.890
 cotton in got elevation I'm not even 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.760
 if I have done it well but for 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 that you see what the product is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.760
 has no more mystery that is a kind 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.400
 of dust 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.890
 pretty teeny 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.870
 that hooks good gets hooked between 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.060
 the hairs and it is already a kind of 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.700
 Volume sensation does nothing else 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.170
 it does not have any kind of mystery what 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.110
 you can find on his website I think 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.030
 I dug dotcom and nothing will teach you 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.570
 now again in more detail how 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.570
 it really works 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.399
 Well, we started a little bit again 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.329
 with the explanation of how it works for 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.149
 that you see that there is no trap or cardboard 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:17.060
 the same boat we are a little bit 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.720
 more the same role as before so that is 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.720
 the same product 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.740
 do not have a little more around here 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.780
 what product are we going that is not any 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.910
 invention is not pimentel or like some 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.620
 you have 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.620
 we have cardboard here no longer 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.450
 so you can see 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.630
 as it looks pretty good 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.250
 and as my mother said she was the one 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.579
 will fill in the video let's go to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.579
 process 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.360
 you see that it has no 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.960
 and there is no other possibility that it is 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.960
 anything else 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.580
 but for the moment I do not know if it is appreciated 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.870
 around here these little balls that really is 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.800
 what the product carries and is what it 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.340
 embeds between the hairs 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.340
 yes 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.970
 it can be clearly seen that 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.260
 example here you see that there is a piece of 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.260
 clutter still but the other part 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.850
 it's practically perfect 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.099
 I do not know if the same thing also appears here 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.099
 these little pieces 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.340
 It is the product 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.140
 It is basically good and no more 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.110
 possible explanation 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.170
 this is what it is and there is no type 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.560
 of possible fake of ge by nowhere nor 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.560
 nothing else 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.640
 another one of the things you asked was 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.510
 that if he was going or not touching with the water 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.910
 what you have to say is that only for 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.660
 remove it so just washing with 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.890
 water to the head because it goes away completely and 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.140
 you also ask what is still scratching 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.910
 now you will see how 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.910
 the subject scratches his head 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.820
 and if it is well applied or leave and leave 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.910
 in the hands is not that leave either 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.850
 no special product trail and 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.900
 especially when time goes by 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.600
 well 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.630
 stays better placed stays or is 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.810
 that does not go easily with the wind 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.810
 neither
