fabric<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:17.520> great<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.539> frost<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.230> sort

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
fabric it's great for a frost that sort

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.840 
fabric it's great for a frost that sort
of<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:19.800> bit<00:00:20.070> later<00:00:20.340> than<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> would

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
of is a little bit later than you would

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.310 
of is a little bit later than you would
think<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> spring<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:21.779> frost<00:00:22.140> it's

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
think in the spring or frost it's

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.019 
think in the spring or frost it's
earlier<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> fall<00:00:23.130> we've<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.519> one<00:00:23.670> coming

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
earlier in the fall we've got one coming

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
earlier in the fall we've got one coming
tonight<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.689> also<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.350> good<00:00:25.560> for

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
tonight and also it's good for

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.099 
tonight and also it's good for
protecting<00:00:26.189> against<00:00:26.460> insects<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.990> see

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
protecting against insects so I can see

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
protecting against insects so I can see
a<00:00:28.140> lot<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.410> fabric<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.310> tell<00:00:29.490> me<00:00:29.519> about

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
a lot of fabric here so tell me about

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
a lot of fabric here so tell me about
some<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> differences<00:00:30.599> how<00:00:31.410> commercial

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
some of the differences how commercial

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
some of the differences how commercial
growers<00:00:32.640> homeowners<00:00:33.120> would<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
growers homeowners would use this and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
growers homeowners would use this and
why<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.130> choose<00:00:35.520> different<00:00:35.969> grades<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
why you choose different grades of

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.590 
why you choose different grades of
fabric<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.649> fabric<00:00:38.010> itself<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.879> different

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
fabric the fabric itself is different

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290 
fabric the fabric itself is different
thicknesses<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> thinner<00:00:41.010> fabric<00:00:41.309> that's

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
thicknesses so a thinner fabric that's

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
thicknesses so a thinner fabric that's
more<00:00:42.510> light<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.739> great<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.100> insect

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
more light in it's great for insect

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790 
more light in it's great for insect
control<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.390> heavier<00:00:45.719> than<00:00:45.840> fabric<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.590> more

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
control the heavier than fabric the more

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.190 
control the heavier than fabric the more
heat<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:47.940> hold<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.300> all<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:48.989> plants

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
heat it will hold in all your plants

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
heat it will hold in all your plants
help<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.739> protect<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.160> from<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> frost<00:00:50.640> so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
help it protect it from the frost so

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.200 
help it protect it from the frost so
this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.300> AG<00:00:52.199> 50<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.800> right<00:00:53.010> sick<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.879> frost

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
this is AG 50 all right sick for frost

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
this is AG 50 all right sick for frost
control<00:00:54.620> 70<00:00:55.620> looks<00:00:55.770> even<00:00:55.980> thicker<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
control 70 looks even thicker it's a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.279 
control 70 looks even thicker it's a
little<00:00:56.670> more<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.780> frost<00:00:58.079> protection

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
little more for more frost protection

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.279 
little more for more frost protection
the<00:00:58.949> AG<00:00:59.699> 15<00:01:00.149> which<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.660> insect<00:01:01.020> barrier<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the AG 15 which is an insect barrier is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.200 
the AG 15 which is an insect barrier is
relatively<00:01:01.590> thin<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.430> we're<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.789> cover

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
relatively thin so we're going to cover

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
relatively thin so we're going to cover
these<00:01:03.449> cauliflowers<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.769> dig<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> trench

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
these cauliflowers here we dig a trench

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.740 
these cauliflowers here we dig a trench

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
fabric with the soil let's go to work

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
fabric with the soil let's go to work
here<00:01:15.150> we'll<00:01:15.299> start<00:01:15.509> digging<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.710> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> go

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
here we'll start digging you want to go

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
here we'll start digging you want to go
a<00:01:17.040> couple<00:01:17.280> inches<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> how<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.570> dug

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
a couple inches down so how are we dug

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
a couple inches down so how are we dug
our<00:01:22.020> trench<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> now<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.100> lay<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.790> down

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
our trench and now just lay this down

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
our trench and now just lay this down
just<00:01:24.479> lay<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:25.080> put<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> edge<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
just lay it down we put the edge of the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410 
just lay it down we put the edge of the
fabric<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> trench<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.909> cover<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> edge

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
fabric in the trench and cover the edge

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.480 
fabric in the trench and cover the edge
with<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> soil

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.490 

it's<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.270> good<00:01:35.390> little<00:01:35.540> trick<00:01:35.780> using<00:01:36.079> your<00:01:36.320> foot

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
it's a good little trick using your foot

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.499 
it's a good little trick using your foot
to<00:01:36.590> hold<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:36.920> fabric<00:01:37.100> down<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:37.610> then<00:01:37.700> holding

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
to hold the fabric down and then holding

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.090 
to hold the fabric down and then holding
the<00:01:38.540> dirt<00:01:38.840> right<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.170> top<00:01:39.439> in<00:01:39.619> front<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:39.979> you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
the dirt right on top in front of you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.130 
the dirt right on top in front of you
this<00:01:40.850> really<00:01:41.210> does<00:01:41.390> work<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.899> know<00:01:41.990> this

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
this really does work you know this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.810 
this really does work you know this
thing's<00:01:42.380> not<00:01:42.530> going<00:01:42.770> anywhere<00:01:43.220> now<00:01:43.640> we're

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
thing's not going anywhere now we're

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.190 
thing's not going anywhere now we're
going<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:44.030> see<00:01:44.180> what<00:01:44.330> we<00:01:44.420> have<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.630> do<00:01:44.720> with<00:01:44.840> you
