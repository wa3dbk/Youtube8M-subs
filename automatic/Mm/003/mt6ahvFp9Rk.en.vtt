00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:17.099
 hi guys all promised to make a video here 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.860
 and x4 what's new there as a base place 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:24.480
 Now a brief overview at the town hall level 4 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:30.390
 It means first that appeared again but 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:36.330
 This 2 Alexey elixir rather their collector 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:41.970
 and the glorious mines further one gun into the game 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:44.670
 one better beyonce also appeared yet 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:50.420
 one barracks that is now possible troops 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:55.290
 improve train faster here legs 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.920
 still a completely new thing here so 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.360
 called air defense 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.700
 than its feature is such a thing 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:09.240
 who protects your village he raids with 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.829
 air that is against she is all flying 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.350
 dragons and neons so further it is clear that 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.770
 about capable 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.909
 balls all that moves put on 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.149
 ground targets immediately said not 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.600
 reacts new against air very 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.869
 effective and therefore you raise it 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.549
 take canada especially on further 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.509
 when will you come to big markets 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:42.950
 Be sure to improve this here and rdf 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:45.539
 so called in principle and again yet 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.999
 bong-jun bombs 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.179
 than one bomb will appear now 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:54.479
 his finger is destroyed and such signs 2 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:58.799
 mean am pancakes make they hidden 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.179
 as well as bombs for attacking eyes means 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.490
 then let the troops come here 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.119
 from pancake part of the troops is triggered 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.399
 flies off throws it off completely and not 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.300
 Don are killed by a set it is clear that not 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.060
 explode at night 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.599
 and when will come 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:19.599
 but we have such a set of innovations 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:25.209
 transition, it is clear that there appeared 25 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:27.580
 walls I have them all successfully set up camp 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.239
 left two basically more 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.739
 would like nothing now 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.860
 talk a little bit more about the alignment 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.720
 intermediary prince principle is the same as before 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.900
 This we considered at the level 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.920
 Town Hall 3 that is important for us 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:50.260
 protect our repository feel 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.750
 accordingly as efficiently as possible 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.019
 spread around the perimeter of df or our 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.319
 protection means here such lines offered 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.310
 based on the number of fence means 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:08.190
 see that he or the side to the middle 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.690
 the apartment is next to it and rdf is also near 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.450
 range of you almost all whim 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.239
 closes the range of the markers as well 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.640
 hiding almost the entire database except 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.079
 of these constructions 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.690
 further here flour put the archer tower 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.950
 than one, respectively, and accordingly 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.380
 opposite corners just toys 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.079
 too, the gun on Ava had to endure 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.630
 elixir storage on the territory but 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.650
 see here in principle if you 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.959
 something gathered to improve the elixir of gold 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.280
 opinion is important yes 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.889
 change places take leave here 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.959
 Elixir storage can do this 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.810
 combination yes here or 2 elixir 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.380
 storage on or 28 depends because 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.310
 more important to you 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.900
 here could clearly set here if in 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.030
 Clan and the troops you have dirty 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.810
 Fortress clan together they defend 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.900
 this is also a plus here protects mortar 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:18.250
 hold the gun feels i mean protection 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.840
 so pretty seriously, it's clear that 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.480
 all elixir storage will 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:28.630
 or all of the debt that produces the elixir I 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:32.610
 handed over the fence in this talked clearly 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:36.130
 what laboratories and camps general principle 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.240
 in parallel will be blown up or not you take and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.070
 saves the most expensive 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.590
 as usual but basically the entire video 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.290
 turned out short 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.040
 going to town hall 5 will be very 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.380
 many changes 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.900
 deliberately will not build yet wait 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.040
 when my nipples improves apnu by 5 and 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.560
 especially what I will not build 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.840
 you are in order 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.830
 once again wanted to say that in a hurry 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.350
 move to a new level of pumped 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.570
 all maximally mostly wench 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.080
 pumping help the walls of course 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.870
 desirable too but not very tall yet 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.300
 principle, you can go on the walls at least 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:24.850
 guys up to 3 swing the unholy everything 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.620
 the rest other guns and mortars all by 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:32.039
 Maxim well, and it is generally desirable that 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.289
 of course too 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.120
 so that you fit more army in 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.490
 Generally do not rush here now to rob 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.950
 pretty easy 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.010
 for each attack there are 20 to 30 thousand 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.550
 you can easily like some 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.870
 build 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.360
 if you have money, delete these 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.010
 all trees, stones, see us left 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.120
 120 crystals to 500 when we can 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.389
 buy a third building 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.840
 development will go faster so again 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.650
 take your time playing house 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.389
 experiment with base placement 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.570
 show a member of the organization 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.250
 because whether 25 is needed to multiply and right 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.680
 here bye 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.229
 experimenting better on cups 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.630
 until they bother 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:22.120
 intelligibility someone may want to find 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:26.550
 grit 150 can do it because 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.370
 what's his reward I'll tell you now 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.729
 450 pros 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.860
 that is, you can immediately buy a third 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:38.490
 the builder is another clear from the cross 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.540
 well try maybe 1250 principle 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.810
 500 google left 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.440
 if there is 15 20 30 to take away the plant 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.020
 stage i'm not afraid yet they are righteous by 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.220
 time and then all the good luck 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.220
 farm see
