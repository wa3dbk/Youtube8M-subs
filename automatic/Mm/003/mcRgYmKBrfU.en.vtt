 for one of the cards for passing you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 You know, there are such as for passing 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.619
 this is miss hell not generally reveal the tasks 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.990
 I 'll show you my need to kill mobs 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.550
 and for what I ask so time and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.230
 find out what might need to kill him 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.699
 its blood will flow 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.439
 but it requires a zombie that will 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.400
 If red blood creeper green onions 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 you will understand now 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 time we will have scraps 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.759
 which here we will crawl if you 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.920
 got to the end we will lose Well 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 Well I press the button to start and we 1 la 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.879
 we see that the stopwatch is very 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.950
 fast and if we are in 100 seconds 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.230
 well, our conditional 100 seconds we do not have time 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.899
 then we lose and that's where man 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.789
 who helped me do it his name is 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.760
 jack well what are we looking for mobs that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.590
 bleed and if we can't find 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 will not write a team there thanks 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.680
 whom we put anyone at all whom points 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.180
 I found a zombie on y. I already saw a video 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.899
 what zombies who exactly oil how much 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.000
 hit him and he will die and now she 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.830
 need to look for another zombie we see here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 this fact has no such other zombies 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.000
 mob that world 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 suck monster not stand in a row and therefore 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.420
 they are easy to find 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.470
 and then who else we still who we still who 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.270
 who who who who 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.170
 we need to quickly because time 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 ends we can't find anyone 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 maybe this is who it is where I am not I am not 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.540
 I see who looks wrong in general 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 if now i lose here i am written 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.509
 lost and change is getting stronger 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.150
 in a certain room hear write 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.700
 hint who came up this witch 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.010
 I did not have time I clicked to kill the witch on 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.550
 overall i lost an hour and essentially like this 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.550
 does same 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.659
 I 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:32.620
 you can look for what could seem to me 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.290
 you lost with us, too, he lost 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.290
 dare so in general and if we killed 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.000
 six times in a row infected zombies then we 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.829
 would have won sock beware we need 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 room, and also has a wire to make 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:54.849
 let's do it again you can zombies 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.670
 but on all he won us appears 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.069
 the inscription you when i means that it 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.510
 you look so how to do it cs not 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.180
 very simple we used two 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.819
 skuboard and this is in f2 and killer 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.459
 and for what we used killer 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.109
 was given to the mob that was infected by 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.970
 this was shown by party club 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.209
 that he was infected and he was bleeding 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.319
 thanks flowed a wave this wave 1 2 3 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.680
 4 5 6 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.049
 but what to start we played zombies 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.150
 and and the mobs are shorter in these mobs here 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.329
 Nazi on the blocks which remember 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.190
 all the magicians who were standing here a 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.290
 here is put mouth block and thanks 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.480
 the fact that here is a team of ss and poker 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.109
 here it disappears in general further a 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.540
 farther man managed wife 20 not to 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.669
 passed and what nonsense and he does not 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.419
 It was on the initial game in f1 and not that 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:49.239
 of that and then all the players are always like that 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.129
 all players removed cost to 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.780
 he had 0 at the beginning of the game because 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.870
 teleports player to our room 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.669
 so that you can start the fight then give 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.540
 him a scoreboard outlet to say what 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.530
 this is the first wave 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.659
 then we remove him again level for some reason 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.699
 oh well we here we cleaned the level 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.419
 then here we took led what is it on 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:12.400
 just in case, and then we give the inscription 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.069
 what was first started and then 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.979
 thanks to team scoreboard player set 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.109
 rand that is randomly and relatively 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.139
 This block is in the center. 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.760
 from if this block within 8 blocks 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.040
 and all the mothers that there is something there 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.500
 I can have one here in this zone 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.720
 given point one killer and it is know what 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.390
 the fact that he is infected with us we need him 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.120
 kill further what happens we kill 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.730
 this mom but before we kill him 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.650
 meet one of this comparator 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.950
 meet as he says something in 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.480
 the world have this pug scoreboard he kia 1 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.780
 and therefore this torch goes out 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.390
 when we kill the mob stops burning 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.670
 because the map is dead and therefore it lights up 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.280
 torch which first 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.880
 gives adds one wave to us 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.160
 located at 34 then removes hung 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.640
 him so you can get a new wave 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.940
 left again and then tells us about the new 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.560
 wave and also again gives one of 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.710
 mobs that are located here at the maternity hospital 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.000
 one point they could kill a new mob 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.090
 how were they done 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.950
 effects when screaming blood was flowing 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.290
 and for this we used the command 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.720
 flowed that is, if the least one could have found 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.820
 whose scoreboard is to the killer she is 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.250
 do thanks for there houses in the square 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.870
 we made it flowed like this 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.760
 team that allows us to do 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.860
 soiled any item of block 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.930
 mykraftte is such a simple team and 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.370
 then from the coordinates number 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.860
 speed with is very simple and left 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.230
 tell you about a stopwatch or timer 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.530
 it all depends on the wave if the world is located 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.020
 the man who had minimal experience became 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.820
 this person is testing that is if here 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.360
 we and when we have the first second third 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.870
 level 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.270
 this comparator is off but if i have 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.160
 The first wave of waiting and my slouching led 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.110
 then the block is going to 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.050
 and then I teleport all mobs 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.790
 kills from there and put me to zero 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.590
 so that I have ska bards and all the experience 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.360
 going and it turns out we lost and 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.470
 the same happens with the second wave 3 then 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.170
 there is in the second wave already 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.770
 mom we get sick at least 80 later 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.690
 already 6040 and the last shaft 6 that is it 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.760
 in general will only open appeared 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.450
 called to kill if you kill then you 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.090
 lose 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.610
 and the last one is why we have zombies from 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.190
 cells did not burn during the day but thanks 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.340
 team entity data which is called 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.169
 fire 0c could always be given file 0 with 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.849
 and because when we could it burns 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.789
 can already cost 150 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.979
 60 the more and the fire mode burns 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:48.339
 its value p p increases so we 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.050
 every tag of this endless engine 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:51.520
 set zero so we could not 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.529
 burned so if you want your 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.319
 could in the picture of the career then leave them 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:56.889
 fire 0 so what can be done on it 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.429
 to finish 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:03.039
 and in this this chain did zheka I did 

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:04.270
 only flowed and mobs and all helped out 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.800
 he stopped so you can 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.189
 say goodbye to everyone thanks for watching everyone 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.189
 until
