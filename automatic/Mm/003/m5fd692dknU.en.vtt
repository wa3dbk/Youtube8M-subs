00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.369
 come on 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.029
 he 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.420
 one never gets tired of talking about the 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.670
 courage 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.090
 we often hear this term 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.410
 but the meaning is not well understood 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.390
 courage from the Latin corano or cuore noi 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.659
 I want to put my heart and have 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.760
 courage because this is indispensable 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.630
 in life choices in future choices 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.660
 in a tomorrow uncertain times 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.280
 after making an inquiry 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.680
 involving all our fellow citizens 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.670
 of variety we have decided to change the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.490
 mentality through the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.290
 awareness to have courage is there 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.100
 need to get involved and what 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.690
 which was the thing ours does before it 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.970
 of courage was to re-evaluate 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.470
 our second action of courage has 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.030
 involved young people through the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.030
 dissemination of messages possible 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.260
 and now having to give our path 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.330
 will end at the happy park 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.460
 mastroianni where we would like to put in 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.229
 practice some projects to enhance it 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.690
 and the time to act 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.010
 now also touches 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.790
 we have continued to make choices 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.240
 my nationality was enough for me 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.240
