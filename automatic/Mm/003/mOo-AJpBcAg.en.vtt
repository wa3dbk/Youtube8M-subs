00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.169 
the four ponies that live on sweet Apple
acres<00:01:36.050> because<00:01:36.739> this<00:01:37.099> scene<00:01:37.340> especially<00:01:37.489> was

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
acres because this scene especially was

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.389 
acres because this scene especially was
just<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.569> really<00:01:38.840> cute<00:01:39.229> family<00:01:39.619> scene<00:01:40.069> I<00:01:40.280> mean

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
just a really cute family scene I mean

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.520 
just a really cute family scene I mean
the<00:01:40.550> show<00:01:40.759> centers<00:01:41.119> around<00:01:41.450> friendship<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.289> ton

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
the show centers around friendship a ton

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.380 
the show centers around friendship a ton
but<00:01:43.160> it's<00:01:43.310> pretty<00:01:43.550> rare<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:44.209> get<00:01:44.330> a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
but it's pretty rare that you get a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.479 
but it's pretty rare that you get a
scene<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.929> family<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.530> family<00:01:45.860> interactions

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:46.489 
scene of family and family interactions

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.809 
scene of family and family interactions
which<00:01:46.640> I<00:01:46.759> found<00:01:46.970> pretty<00:01:47.090> special<00:01:48.550> though<00:01:49.550> as

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
which I found pretty special though as

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.339 
which I found pretty special though as
you<00:01:50.149> may<00:01:50.300> have<00:01:50.330> noticed<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.959> Apple<00:01:51.170> drugs

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
you may have noticed the Apple drugs

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.229 
you may have noticed the Apple drugs
parents<00:01:51.770> are<00:01:51.860> never<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.160> this<00:01:52.250> episode<00:01:52.700> but

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.239 
parents are never in this episode but

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.570 
parents are never in this episode but
I'm<00:01:53.420> okay<00:01:53.929> with<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.410> concept<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.039> them<00:01:55.280> being

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
I'm okay with the concept of them being

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.699 
I'm okay with the concept of them being
dead<00:01:55.880> because<00:01:56.330> there's<00:01:56.810> still<00:01:57.020> such<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.259> happy

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
dead because there's still such a happy

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.370 
dead because there's still such a happy
and<00:01:57.739> close<00:01:58.039> family<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.539> do<00:01:59.599> think<00:02:00.110> that

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
and close family and I do think that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.020 
and close family and I do think that
these<00:02:00.500> two<00:02:00.770> stars<00:02:01.099> that<00:02:01.310> fly<00:02:01.459> by<00:02:01.640> right<00:02:01.789> here

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
these two stars that fly by right here

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.119 
these two stars that fly by right here
are<00:02:02.360> supposed<00:02:02.899> to<00:02:02.989> represent<00:02:03.500> her<00:02:03.679> parents

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 
are supposed to represent her parents

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.919 
are supposed to represent her parents
and<00:02:04.310> obviously<00:02:05.270> they're<00:02:05.420> not<00:02:05.569> just<00:02:05.780> gonna

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
and obviously they're not just gonna

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.660 
and obviously they're not just gonna
state<00:02:06.319> that<00:02:06.530> they're<00:02:06.679> dead<00:02:06.890> directly<00:02:07.429> in<00:02:07.580> a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
state that they're dead directly in a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.669 
state that they're dead directly in a
children's<00:02:08.090> TV<00:02:08.330> show<00:02:08.509> but<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.349> think<00:02:09.560> it's

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
children's TV show but I think it's

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.350 
children's TV show but I think it's
really<00:02:09.860> special<00:02:10.099> because<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.819> show<00:02:11.090> really

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
really special because this show really

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.510 
really special because this show really
is<00:02:11.569> for<00:02:11.840> all<00:02:11.959> audiences<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.920> while<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.099> little

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
is for all audiences and while a little

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.010 
is for all audiences and while a little
kid<00:02:13.730> wouldn't<00:02:14.000> notice<00:02:14.270> those<00:02:14.480> stars<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
kid wouldn't notice those stars and

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.170 
kid wouldn't notice those stars and
think<00:02:15.170> anything<00:02:15.530> an<00:02:15.710> older<00:02:16.400> person<00:02:16.790> like<00:02:16.970> us

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
think anything an older person like us

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.070 
think anything an older person like us
as<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> fandom

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
as a fandom

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.500 
as a fandom
would<00:02:18.200> oh<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.490> did<00:02:19.700> anyone<00:02:19.970> notice<00:02:20.330> that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.150

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
really enjoying this episode up to a

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.340 
really enjoying this episode up to a
certain<00:03:15.470> point<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:16.070> then<00:03:16.160> all<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.090> sudden

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
certain point and then all of a sudden

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.000 
certain point and then all of a sudden
Applejack<00:03:18.350> got<00:03:19.480> stupid<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:21.709> don't

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
Applejack got stupid and I just don't

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.680 
Applejack got stupid and I just don't
really<00:03:22.459> know<00:03:22.640> what<00:03:22.790> happened<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.360> if<00:03:23.570> they

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
really know what happened like if they

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.199 
really know what happened like if they
wanted<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.110> finish<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.650> quilt<00:03:25.090> don't<00:03:26.090> you

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
wanted to finish this quilt don't you

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.370 
wanted to finish this quilt don't you
think<00:03:26.450> they<00:03:26.570> would<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:26.780> done<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> long

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
think they would have done that a long

of<00:06:02.289> this<00:06:02.350> episode<00:06:02.530> that<00:06:03.340> was<00:06:03.430> like<00:06:03.580> one<00:06:03.910> of<00:06:03.940> two

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
of this episode that was like one of two

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.980 
of this episode that was like one of two
this<00:06:04.960> entire<00:06:05.350> season<00:06:05.970> it's<00:06:06.970> not<00:06:07.150> particularly

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
this entire season it's not particularly

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.570 
this entire season it's not particularly
about<00:06:08.169> friendship<00:06:08.680> it's<00:06:08.830> more<00:06:08.979> about<00:06:09.130> family

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
about friendship it's more about family

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.790 
about friendship it's more about family
but<00:06:09.820> like<00:06:09.849> Applejack<00:06:10.389> says<00:06:10.630> family's<00:06:11.380> kind<00:06:11.740> of

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
but like Applejack says family's kind of

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.080 
but like Applejack says family's kind of
like<00:06:11.889> your<00:06:12.070> first<00:06:12.250> friends<00:06:12.700> and<00:06:12.910> that<00:06:13.030> was

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
like your first friends and that was

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.750 
like your first friends and that was
pretty<00:06:13.360> cool<00:06:13.479> but<00:06:14.380> I<00:06:14.710> kind<00:06:15.370> of<00:06:15.430> think<00:06:15.550> this

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
pretty cool but I kind of think this

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.850 
pretty cool but I kind of think this
season<00:06:16.240> should<00:06:16.599> have<00:06:16.750> had<00:06:16.930> more<00:06:17.169> letters<00:06:17.590> I

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
season should have had more letters I

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.290 
season should have had more letters I
mean<00:06:18.070> I<00:06:18.190> don't<00:06:18.340> miss<00:06:18.610> them<00:06:18.789> they<00:06:18.970> don't<00:06:19.090> need

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
mean I don't miss them they don't need

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.520 
mean I don't miss them they don't need
to<00:06:19.389> be<00:06:19.479> in<00:06:19.570> every<00:06:19.870> episode

to be in every episode

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.290 
to be in every episode
I<00:06:20.560> should<00:06:21.010> like<00:06:21.070> it's<00:06:21.310> part<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:21.729> the<00:06:21.789> show<00:06:22.030> that
