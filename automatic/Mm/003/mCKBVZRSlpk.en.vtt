00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.490 

by<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.410> way<00:00:53.590> I'm<00:00:53.890> using<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.460> flip<00:00:54.820> camera<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
by the way I'm using a flip camera to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.490 
by the way I'm using a flip camera to
record<00:00:56.790> everything<00:00:57.790> on<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.739> longboard<00:01:01.500> they

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
record everything on the longboard they

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.810 
record everything on the longboard they
really<00:01:02.800> aren't<00:01:03.550> really<00:01:03.880> cheap<00:01:04.150> but<00:01:04.570> anyway

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
really aren't really cheap but anyway

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570 
really aren't really cheap but anyway
and<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.840> work<00:01:08.080> they're<00:01:08.560> nice<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.890> small<00:01:09.160> you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
and they work they're nice and small you

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.120 
and they work they're nice and small you
can<00:01:09.729> use<00:01:09.910> anything<00:01:10.180> though<00:01:10.510> so<00:01:11.290> what<00:01:12.010> I'm

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
can use anything though so what I'm

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.750 
can use anything though so what I'm
showing<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.490> right<00:01:12.640> now<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.240> just<00:01:14.020> like<00:01:14.440> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
showing you right now is just like the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.500 
showing you right now is just like the
folder<00:01:15.760> for<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.330> flip<00:01:16.600> camera<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:19.390> what

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
folder for the flip camera so what

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.370 
folder for the flip camera so what
you're<00:01:19.630> going<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.840> do<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.380> grab<00:01:20.890> your<00:01:21.130> device

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you're going to do is grab your device

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.630 
you're going to do is grab your device
that<00:01:23.380> you're<00:01:23.470> going<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.710> record<00:01:24.040> with<00:01:24.310> and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
that you're going to record with and

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.550 
that you're going to record with and
then<00:01:25.570> do<00:01:25.810> sticky<00:01:26.410> side<00:01:26.649> up<00:01:27.009> all<00:01:28.000> around<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
then do sticky side up all around on

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.910 
then do sticky side up all around on
your<00:01:30.040> device<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:32.020> tape<00:01:32.410> isn't<00:01:32.619> actually

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
your device so the tape isn't actually

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.389 
your device so the tape isn't actually
sticking<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.790> your<00:01:33.880> device<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.920> just<00:01:39.160> kind<00:01:39.369> of

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
sticking to your device I'm just kind of

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.029 
sticking to your device I'm just kind of
do<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.729> as<00:01:39.850> much<00:01:40.030> as<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:41.020> don't<00:01:41.860> date

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
do it as much as you can I don't date

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.680 
do it as much as you can I don't date
don't<00:01:42.490> get<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.700> too<00:01:42.850> tight<00:01:43.119> either<00:01:43.390> because

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
don't get it too tight either because

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.420 
don't get it too tight either because
then<00:01:44.020> you'll<00:01:44.170> have<00:01:44.289> problems<00:01:44.500> getting<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.220> and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
then you'll have problems getting in and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.990 
then you'll have problems getting in and
out<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:46.600> then<00:01:46.720> just<00:01:47.470> sticks<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.250> some<00:01:48.789> tape

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
out and then just sticks and some tape

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.779 
out and then just sticks and some tape
on<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.390> bottom<00:01:49.690> as<00:01:50.500> well<00:01:50.560> as<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.160> wasn't<00:01:51.340> full

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
on the bottom as well as it wasn't full

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.110 
on the bottom as well as it wasn't full
of<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.479> bottom<00:01:52.840> because<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.320> would<00:01:53.410> be<00:01:53.500> bad

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.990 

so<00:01:59.780> once<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.050> do<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.200> you'll<00:02:00.830> just<00:02:01.040> do<00:02:01.670> a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
so once you do that you'll just do a

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.180 
so once you do that you'll just do a
sticky<00:02:02.930> side<00:02:03.170> down<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:04.010> time<00:02:06.040> just<00:02:07.040> be<00:02:07.160> sure

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
sticky side down this time just be sure

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.250 
sticky side down this time just be sure
not<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.640> get<00:02:07.700> any<00:02:07.880> tape<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.260> device<00:02:11.260> they

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
not to get any tape on the device they

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.980 
not to get any tape on the device they
can<00:02:12.560> use<00:02:12.680> any<00:02:12.890> tape<00:02:13.160> for<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.810> use

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
can use any tape for this I like to use

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.150 
can use any tape for this I like to use
painters<00:02:15.350> tape<00:02:15.530> because<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:19.130> just<00:02:19.280> works<00:02:19.550> well

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
painters tape because it just works well

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.720 
painters tape because it just works well
and<00:02:22.160> then<00:02:22.550> for<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.570> outer<00:02:23.780> layer<00:02:24.170> I'll<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:25.070> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
and then for the outer layer I'll do a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.670 
and then for the outer layer I'll do a
duct<00:02:26.330> tape<00:02:26.570> I'm<00:02:26.810> actually<00:02:26.960> using<00:02:27.260> gaff<00:02:27.650> tape

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
duct tape I'm actually using gaff tape

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.280 
duct tape I'm actually using gaff tape
right<00:02:28.160> now<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.180> expensive<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.990> i<00:02:30.050> went

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
right now but it's expensive so i went

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.190 
right now but it's expensive so i went
to<00:02:30.680> just<00:02:30.950> using<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.840> don't<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:32.960> anything

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
to just using it I don't have anything

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.850 
to just using it I don't have anything
else<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.710> use<00:02:33.950> for<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> video<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.930> your<00:02:36.620> stick

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
else to use for a video but your stick

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.560 
else to use for a video but your stick
some<00:02:37.040> extra<00:02:37.280> tape<00:02:37.490> around<00:02:37.730> there<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.390> an

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
some extra tape around there just as an

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.510 
some extra tape around there just as an
extra<00:02:38.990> precaution<00:02:41.890> even<00:02:42.890> though<00:02:43.070> if<00:02:43.250> you're<00:02:43.460> a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
extra precaution even though if you're a

extra precaution even though if you're a
camera<00:02:44.240> does<00:02:44.600> fall<00:02:44.930> you're<00:02:45.230> not<00:02:45.440> going<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.010> be

camera does fall you're not going to be
too<00:02:46.340> protected<00:02:47.470> unfortunately

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.470 

and<00:02:58.270> just<00:02:58.540> six<00:02:58.810> more<00:02:59.110> on<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.380> bottom<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.480> you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
and just six more on the bottom and you

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:10.010 
and just six more on the bottom and you
will<00:03:01.630> be<00:03:01.750> set<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:08.050> some<00:03:08.320> cameras<00:03:08.830> have<00:03:09.100> a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
will be set so some cameras have a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.320 
will be set so some cameras have a
wristband<00:03:11.340> that's<00:03:12.340> really<00:03:12.730> hard<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.000> get<00:03:13.120> on

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
wristband that's really hard to get on

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.500 
wristband that's really hard to get on
and<00:03:13.510> off<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:14.020> what<00:03:14.680> you'll<00:03:14.890> do<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:16.360> can

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
and off so what you'll do is you can

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.610 
and off so what you'll do is you can
just<00:03:16.750> fashion<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:18.550> pouch<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.960> have<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> little

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
just fashion the pouch to have a little

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.730 
just fashion the pouch to have a little
slot<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.959> pretty<00:03:23.260> simple<00:03:23.560> to

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
slot like I have it's pretty simple to

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.220 
slot like I have it's pretty simple to
do<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.730> can<00:03:24.880> also<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.240> cut<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.990> want

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
the job done and I made this patch a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.250 
the job done and I made this patch a
little<00:03:34.120> bit<00:03:34.209> too<00:03:34.360> tight<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.840> problems

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
little bit too tight so I problems

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.080 
little bit too tight so I problems
getting<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.680> there<00:03:37.170> don't<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.290> do<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:39.090> will

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
getting in there don't you do that will

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.949 
getting in there don't you do that will
be<00:03:40.239> set<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.480> go<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:42.280> now<00:03:42.670> you'll<00:03:43.270> be<00:03:43.360> mounting

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
be set to go so now you'll be mounting

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.680 
be set to go so now you'll be mounting
at<00:03:44.110> l<00:03:44.350> bracket<00:03:44.860> onto<00:03:45.070> your<00:03:45.459> board<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.660> can

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
at l bracket onto your board you can

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.910 
at l bracket onto your board you can
drill<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> hole<00:03:47.830> in<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.790> stick<00:03:49.600> some<00:03:49.920> bolts

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
drill a hole in it and stick some bolts

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.010 
drill a hole in it and stick some bolts
down<00:03:51.130> in<00:03:51.370> there<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.120> touch<00:03:52.450> your<00:03:52.660> wing<00:03:52.810> nut

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
down in there and a touch your wing nut

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.320 
down in there and a touch your wing nut
bottom<00:03:53.739> or<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.160> can<00:03:54.340> just<00:03:54.520> screw<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.150> like

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
bottom or you can just screw it in like

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.810 
bottom or you can just screw it in like
I<00:03:55.540> do<00:03:55.800> screwing<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.920> in<00:03:57.070> will<00:03:57.370> probably<00:03:57.730> give

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
I do screwing it in will probably give

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.550 
I do screwing it in will probably give
you<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:58.270> more<00:03:58.750> stable<00:03:59.140> shot<00:04:01.230> but<00:04:02.230> that's<00:04:02.350> just

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
you a more stable shot but that's just

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.850 
you a more stable shot but that's just
my<00:04:02.920> opinion<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:04.450> can<00:04:04.570> do<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.900> want<00:04:05.140> you

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
my opinion you can do it you want you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.449 
my opinion you can do it you want you
can<00:04:06.040> also<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:06.570> have<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.600> separate<00:04:08.290> board<00:04:08.980> that

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
can also just have a separate board that

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.920 
can also just have a separate board that
you<00:04:09.489> can<00:04:09.730> use<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.000> record<00:04:15.600> anyway<00:04:16.600> you'll<00:04:16.750> just

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
you can use to record anyway you'll just

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.580 
you can use to record anyway you'll just
tape<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.709> camera<00:04:18.549> onto<00:04:18.880> your<00:04:19.660> L<00:04:19.870> bracket<00:04:20.440> and

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
tape the camera onto your L bracket and

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.469 
tape the camera onto your L bracket and
little<00:04:21.190> actually<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:21.820> very<00:04:22.419> secure<00:04:24.300> when<00:04:25.300> she

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
little actually so very secure when she

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.790 
little actually so very secure when she
ready<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.870> record<00:04:26.290> just<00:04:26.919> fit<00:04:27.160> power<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:29.470> hit

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
ready to record just fit power and hit

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.980 
ready to record just fit power and hit
record

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.160 

and<00:04:33.530> slide<00:04:33.860> your<00:04:33.890> advice<00:04:34.400> into<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.910> pouch

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.420 

this<00:04:39.170> will<00:04:39.320> work<00:04:39.350> with<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> lot<00:04:39.890> of<00:04:39.950> different

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
this will work with a lot of different

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.840 
this will work with a lot of different
devices<00:04:40.990> I'm<00:04:41.990> sure<00:04:42.320> out<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.770> jerry-rig<00:04:43.490> it

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
devices I'm sure out to jerry-rig it

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.560 
devices I'm sure out to jerry-rig it
somehow<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.420> little<00:04:44.810> bit<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:47.330> can<00:04:47.480> get

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
somehow a little bit but you can get

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:57.810 
somehow a little bit but you can get
some<00:04:47.750> really<00:04:47.900> cool<00:04:48.200> results<00:04:48.620> with<00:04:48.740> this

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.880
