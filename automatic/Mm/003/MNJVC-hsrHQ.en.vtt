first gold gun with the mtar and why not

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
Annie adequate so I've been playing a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.370 
Annie adequate so I've been playing a
lot<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.880> domination<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:06.720> game<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.110> one

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
lot of domination in this game and one

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.770 
lot of domination in this game and one
thing<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.680> noticed<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.220> when<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.940> capture<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
thing I noticed is when you capture the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.960 
thing I noticed is when you capture the
neutral<00:03:10.200> flags<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.340> C<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.760> really

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
neutral flags like a and C you really

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.130 
neutral flags like a and C you really
don't<00:03:12.120> get<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.270> lot<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.450> points<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.020> that

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
don't get a lot of points and that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.260 
don't get a lot of points and that
really<00:03:13.350> sucks<00:03:13.740> here's<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.700> end<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> first

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
really sucks here's the end of the first

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.370 
really sucks here's the end of the first
round<00:03:15.450> but<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:17.360> they<00:03:18.360> could<00:03:18.570> change<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.110> and

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
round but if they could change that and

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.960 
round but if they could change that and
maybe<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.800> know<00:03:19.920> make<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.459> it's<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.700> hundred

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
maybe you know make it so it's a hundred

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.330 
maybe you know make it so it's a hundred
points<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.570> would<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.810> awesome<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.890> don't

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
points that would be awesome I don't

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.070 
points that would be awesome I don't
think<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:23.580> going<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.730> happen<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.600> know<00:03:24.750> be

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080

nice<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.510> if<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.140> capture<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.709> enemy<00:03:28.890> flag

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
nice and if you capture the enemy flag

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.910 
nice and if you capture the enemy flag

seven<00:03:44.549> more<00:03:44.850> kills<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.750> get<00:03:45.989> your<00:03:46.290> war<00:03:46.560> hog

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
seven more kills to get your war hog

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.970 
seven more kills to get your war hog
which<00:03:48.150> isn't<00:03:48.360> really<00:03:48.540> hard<00:03:48.930> because<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.500> know

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
which isn't really hard because you know

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.009 
which isn't really hard because you know
I'm<00:03:50.130> black<00:03:50.400> ops<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.970> seven<00:03:51.420> kills<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:51.989> a

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
I'm black ops is seven kills is like a

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.640 
I'm black ops is seven kills is like a
blackbird<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:54.000> if<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.360> get<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.780> then<00:03:55.470> you're

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
blackbird so if you get that then you're

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.250 
blackbird so if you get that then you're
pretty<00:03:55.799> much<00:03:55.920> set<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.580> know<00:03:56.700> also<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:58.230> a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
pretty much set you know also I have a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.229 
pretty much set you know also I have a
pretty<00:03:58.500> cool<00:03:58.769> killstreak<00:03:59.459> set<00:03:59.700> up<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.060> that's

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
pretty cool killstreak set up and that's

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.190 
pretty cool killstreak set up and that's
UAV<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.980> Hellfire<00:04:02.370> missile<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.510> Warhawk

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
UAV the Hellfire missile and the Warhawk

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.490 
UAV the Hellfire missile and the Warhawk
and<00:04:05.390> when<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.450> use<00:04:06.600> your<00:04:06.750> UAV<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.320> get<00:04:07.470> a

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
and when you use your UAV you get a

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.080 
and when you use your UAV you get a
little<00:04:07.680> bit<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.890> points<00:04:08.310> which<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.640> nice<00:04:08.850> I

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
little bit of points which is nice I

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.120 
little bit of points which is nice I
think<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.390> like<00:04:09.630> 25<00:04:10.110> points<00:04:10.470> or<00:04:10.590> something<00:04:10.739> if

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
think you like 25 points or something if

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.150 
think you like 25 points or something if
they<00:04:12.030> kill<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.420> enemy<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:14.040> know

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
they kill the enemy and then you know

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.830 
they kill the enemy and then you know
that<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.549> Hellfire<00:04:14.970> missile<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.450> pretty<00:04:15.660> badass

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
that a Hellfire missile is pretty badass

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.259 
that a Hellfire missile is pretty badass

beat that with you know getting maybe

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.400 
beat that with you know getting maybe

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
what is it like 600 points or something

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.230 
what is it like 600 points or something
and<00:04:49.560> you're<00:04:50.370> going<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.580> rake<00:04:50.880> up<00:04:50.910> your

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
and you're going to rake up your

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.820 
and you're going to rake up your
killstreak<00:04:51.780> can<00:04:51.930> get<00:04:52.080> that<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.410> know<00:04:52.530> higher

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
killstreak can get that you know higher

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.100 
killstreak can get that you know higher
kill<00:04:53.130> streak<00:04:53.400> as<00:04:53.580> well<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.660> have<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.900> work

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
kill streak as well so you have to work

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.230 
kill streak as well so you have to work
figure<00:04:55.710> out<00:04:55.860> what<00:04:56.040> killstreaks<00:04:56.580> work<00:04:56.850> because

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
figure out what killstreaks work because

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.400 
figure out what killstreaks work because
this<00:04:57.360> could<00:04:57.480> be<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.660> little<00:04:57.870> different<00:04:58.140> with

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
this could be a little different with

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.990 
this could be a little different with
this<00:04:58.530> game<00:04:58.770> because<00:04:58.980> since<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.490> point<00:04:59.820> base

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
this game because since this point base

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.150 
this game because since this point base
is<00:05:00.240> not<00:05:00.420> kill<00:05:00.720> based<00:05:00.960> makes<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.920> little

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
is not kill based makes a little

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.000 
is not kill based makes a little
difficult<00:05:02.640> to<00:05:02.700> figure<00:05:02.940> out<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.330> know<00:05:03.360> how<00:05:03.720> to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
difficult to figure out you know how to

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.350 
difficult to figure out you know how to
approach<00:05:05.010> your<00:05:05.220> shot<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.850> make<00:05:06.000> it<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.210> little

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
approach your shot and make it a little

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.610 
approach your shot and make it a little
bit<00:05:06.540> better<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:08.280> just<00:05:08.640> has<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.380> flow<00:05:10.380> with

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
bit better so it just has to flow with

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.900 
bit better so it just has to flow with
your<00:05:10.800> gameplay<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.340> have<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.580> figure<00:05:11.730> out

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
your gameplay you have to figure out

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.090 
your gameplay you have to figure out
what<00:05:12.090> works<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.570> once<00:05:13.560> i'm<00:05:13.710> done<00:05:13.740> with<00:05:13.980> the

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
what works and once i'm done with the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.700 
what works and once i'm done with the
gold<00:05:14.310> camo<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:15.390> this<00:05:15.660> weapon<00:05:15.840> i<00:05:16.140> am<00:05:16.260> done<00:05:16.530> with

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
gold camo on this weapon i am done with

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.230 
gold camo on this weapon i am done with
the<00:05:16.830> mtar<00:05:17.190> I'll<00:05:17.400> tell<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.670> much<00:05:17.820> because

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
the mtar I'll tell you that much because

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.320 
the mtar I'll tell you that much because
I<00:05:18.690> know<00:05:19.260> there<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.680> so<00:05:20.040> many<00:05:20.190> better<00:05:20.790> weapons

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
I know there is so many better weapons

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.210 
I know there is so many better weapons
out<00:05:21.510> there<00:05:21.540> it's<00:05:21.900> just<00:05:22.110> ridiculous<00:05:22.830> how<00:05:22.860> many

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
out there it's just ridiculous how many

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
something you can get it done really

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.330 
something you can get it done really
quick<00:05:39.720> but<00:05:39.990> you're<00:05:40.140> really<00:05:40.350> suffering<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:41.190> mean

it is rough like I seriously cannot win

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.000 
it is rough like I seriously cannot win
any<00:05:44.130> gun<00:05:44.370> fight<00:05:44.580> if<00:05:44.760> it's<00:05:44.910> lagging<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:46.010> you

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
any gun fight if it's lagging so you

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.410 
any gun fight if it's lagging so you
have<00:05:47.130> to<00:05:47.250> really<00:05:47.280> put<00:05:47.610> on<00:05:47.700> your<00:05:47.850> a-game<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:48.240> I

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
have to really put on your a-game and I

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.420 
have to really put on your a-game and I
can<00:05:48.570> imagine<00:05:48.720> like<00:05:49.170> with<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.800> other<00:05:49.950> weapons

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
can imagine like with the other weapons

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.040 
can imagine like with the other weapons
like<00:05:50.610> sniper<00:05:50.880> rifles<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.510> stuff<00:05:51.690> like<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:51.870> I

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
like sniper rifles and stuff like that I

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.050 
like sniper rifles and stuff like that I
know<00:05:52.290> it's<00:05:52.530> like<00:05:52.620> one<00:05:52.920> one<00:05:53.310> shot<00:05:53.520> kill<00:05:53.730> you<00:05:53.910> can

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
know it's like one one shot kill you can

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.030 
know it's like one one shot kill you can
get<00:05:54.240> it<00:05:54.360> but<00:05:54.570> with<00:05:55.200> this<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.440> have<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:55.860> get

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
get it but with this you have to get

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.130 
get it but with this you have to get
headshots<00:05:56.250> first<00:05:56.850> and<00:05:57.630> then<00:05:57.750> once<00:05:57.900> you<00:05:57.990> get

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
headshots first and then once you get

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.660 
headshots first and then once you get
the<00:05:58.230> head<00:05:58.380> shots<00:05:58.680> then<00:05:58.980> you<00:05:59.130> can<00:05:59.310> go<00:05:59.400> for<00:05:59.580> the

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
the head shots then you can go for the

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.510 
the head shots then you can go for the
other<00:05:59.790> stuff<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:00.590> it<00:06:01.590> takes<00:06:01.800> a<00:06:01.920> little<00:06:02.070> bit<00:06:02.280> and

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
other stuff so it takes a little bit and

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.270 
other stuff so it takes a little bit and
right<00:06:03.330> when<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:03.810> game<00:06:04.170> started<00:06:04.710> I<00:06:04.860> saw<00:06:05.070> some

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
right when the game started I saw some

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.830 
right when the game started I saw some
guy<00:06:05.460> already<00:06:05.730> have<00:06:05.910> a<00:06:05.940> gold<00:06:06.240> camo<00:06:06.600> and<00:06:06.690> he<00:06:06.750> was

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
guy already have a gold camo and he was

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.650 
guy already have a gold camo and he was
like<00:06:06.900> level<00:06:07.320> 38<00:06:07.830> now<00:06:08.100> he<00:06:08.940> definitely<00:06:09.360> was

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
like level 38 now he definitely was

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.450 
like level 38 now he definitely was
doing<00:06:10.260> some<00:06:10.470> boosting<00:06:10.890> or<00:06:11.010> something<00:06:11.370> because

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
doing some boosting or something because

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.130 
doing some boosting or something because
there's<00:06:11.610> no<00:06:11.940> way<00:06:12.120> you<00:06:12.180> could<00:06:12.480> get<00:06:12.600> gold<00:06:12.870> camo

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
there's no way you could get gold camo

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.200 
there's no way you could get gold camo
right<00:06:13.650> from<00:06:13.920> the<00:06:14.040> get-go<00:06:14.370> but<00:06:14.610> i<00:06:14.850> don't<00:06:15.150> know

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
right from the get-go but i don't know

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.090 
right from the get-go but i don't know
maybe<00:06:15.450> it<00:06:15.630> was<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:15.780> good<00:06:15.930> player<00:06:16.170> but<00:06:16.200> i<00:06:16.770> was

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
maybe it was a good player but i was

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.590 
maybe it was a good player but i was
looking<00:06:17.310> at<00:06:17.340> is<00:06:17.550> katie<00:06:17.820> and<00:06:18.150> he<00:06:18.210> didn't<00:06:18.510> have

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
it in the comments section and I had a

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.730 
it in the comments section and I had a
pretty<00:06:32.760> decent<00:06:32.880> game<00:06:33.450> in<00:06:33.600> this<00:06:33.750> I<00:06:33.960> think<00:06:34.530> I<00:06:34.590> had

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
pretty decent game in this I think I had

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.650 
pretty decent game in this I think I had
like<00:06:34.860> 30<00:06:35.190> kills<00:06:35.550> or<00:06:35.880> something<00:06:36.240> 30<00:06:36.419> plus

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
like 30 kills or something 30 plus

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.060 
like 30 kills or something 30 plus
skills<00:06:36.900> they<00:06:37.050> could<00:06:37.169> probably<00:06:37.320> have<00:06:37.590> 40<00:06:37.890> plus

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
skills they could probably have 40 plus

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
skills they could probably have 40 plus
kills<00:06:38.340> that<00:06:38.550> these<00:06:38.729> guys

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
kills that these guys

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.000 
kills that these guys
wouldn't<00:06:39.300> have<00:06:39.389> backed<00:06:39.600> out<00:06:39.840> which<00:06:40.680> really

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
wouldn't have backed out which really

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.490 
wouldn't have backed out which really
happens<00:06:41.400> a<00:06:41.520> lot<00:06:41.669> in<00:06:41.730> this<00:06:41.910> game<00:06:42.150> and<00:06:42.389> you<00:06:43.380> know
