00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.546
Everybody always runs and hides

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.944
Screaming for protection

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:42.298
Do what they say to get you on their side

00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:45.607
Like buying votes in some election

00:00:46.373 --> 00:00:49.127
But baby, not us three

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.638
We know just where we stand

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.135
We're taking this world on as a team

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.456
And everybody's gonna see, we're a three man band

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.295
We're a three man band

00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:16.757
You talk and talk about how great you are

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:19.704
But the bragging never ends

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.681
And how great could be you really be

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:27.379
When you keep telling us again and again

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.375
But baby, not us three

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.806
We know just where we stand

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:37.395
We're feeling just find in our own skin

00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:42.477
Cause everybody's gonna see, we're a three man band

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:46.720
We're a three man band

00:01:55.522 --> 00:02:00.174
I've learned it's best you count on number one

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:07.038
Especially when number one is three

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:15.212
We'll take you on a ride that you will never, ever soon forget

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.618
You'll see a grand illusion and campaign

00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:25.426
Getting tired of idle talk

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:28.298
Gonna put it to an end

00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:32.275
I think we're gonna tear your castle down

00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:35.775
And build ours up again

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.294
But baby, not us three

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:42.466
We know just where we stand

00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:45.988
We're cleaning this mess up that you made

00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:50.813
Then you'll understand, we're a three man band

00:02:52.384 --> 00:02:54.160
We're a three man band

00:02:55.893 --> 00:02:57.453
We're a three man band

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.131
We're a three man band

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:23.521
We're a three man band
