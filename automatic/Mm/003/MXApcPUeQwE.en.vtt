how<00:03:35.150> suspension<00:03:35.689> works<00:03:35.870> at<00:03:36.019> least<00:03:36.169> I'm

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
how suspension works at least I'm

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.039 
how suspension works at least I'm
showing<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.949> movement<00:03:37.159> that's<00:03:37.519> going<00:03:37.609> on

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
showing you the movement that's going on

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.319 
showing you the movement that's going on
it's<00:03:39.049> really<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.280> seats<00:03:40.549> are<00:03:40.729> separated

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
it's really so the seats are separated

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.599 
it's really so the seats are separated
from<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.049> hall<00:03:42.259> so<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:42.889> don't<00:03:43.099> get<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.400> hard
