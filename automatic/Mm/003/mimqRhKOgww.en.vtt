what<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> gel<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> gel<00:00:58.020> will

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
what a gel will do is a gel will

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
what a gel will do is a gel will
actually<00:00:58.530> absorb<00:00:58.620> shock<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> paint<00:00:59.760> on

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
actually absorb shock to paint on

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.770 
actually absorb shock to paint on
thickness<00:01:00.859> and<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.510> by

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
thickness and it will do this by

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
thickness and it will do this by
basically<00:01:04.290> taking<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> shock<00:01:05.640> waves<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
basically taking the shock waves that

basically taking the shock waves that
are<00:01:06.180> created<00:01:06.600> when<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:06.990> foot<00:01:07.260> steps<00:01:07.920> down<00:01:08.159> to
