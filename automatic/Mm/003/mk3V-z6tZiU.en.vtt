00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.920
 this time we are going to teach you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.380
 make a crown braid which is left 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.390
 very pretty for any occasion 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.309
 The first thing we are going to do is to 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.059
 moisten the hair and 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.059
 unravel 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 let's make a match in the crown in 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.329
 circle shape unraveling it very 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.189
 well that we look good even towards 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.970
 up and we will hold it with a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.970
 cachito 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.720
 we tighten it very well so that we do not get 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.000
 go to let go since this we are going to 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.000
 start feeding our braid 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.900
 let's take a small cadejo of this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.720
 policy that we made 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.930
 and we're going to take a cadejo from the part of 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.930
 ahead 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 with the one from the front we're going to 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.409
 give two loops of the braid 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.530
 and then we feed it with the cadejo that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.040
 we took from the part of the crown this 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.520
 braid we will always do it for 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.520
 under 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.750
 we give another two loops and we continue 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.840
 feeding with small chains that what 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.580
 we must go combing well with the hand 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 or with the help of the comb so that 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.520
 we are well matched 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.759
 we are always going to knit below 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.380
 after we've already 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.680
 approximately five centimeters 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.190
 tissues 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.650
 we're going to take equal parts of both 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.560
 forward as from behind and continue weaving 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.940
 below and the braid is going away 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.940
 becoming thicker 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.260
 the k of jos must be very small 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.340
 so that all the hair reaches us 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.340
 cover the crown 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.370
 as you can see already as we go 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.030
 braiding is doing the braid 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.150
 big 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.810
 and we are covering in a circular way all 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.810
 head 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.310
 we can also decorate this hairstyle 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:39.879
 with flowers ribbons so we can stay 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.879
 for special occasions parties 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.269
 we have to try to fit the 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.269
 circle around the crown 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.180
 we are combing it so that we do not stay 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.569
 imperfections 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.620
 and trying to make the locks that 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.719
 let's take cover all the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.280
 head because if we are missing we 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.280
 the imperfect crown will remain 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.920
 if we have here pure crest we can 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.940
 leave out so we can not catch it 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.940
 also in the braid 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.890
 as you can appreciate as you 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.980
 We advance the braid is becoming very 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.200
 beautiful is giving us the form and now 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.940
 when we are going to finish they can see what 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.410
 what are we going to do so that the part of 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.410
 ahead we are thick 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.560
 We can make this braid in 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.050
 approximately 10 minutes and this if 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.480
 we need the help of another person to 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.810
 finish all the hair we weave until 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.110
 the tip and we take it to the part of 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.490
 forward holding it with a clip or a 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.830
 pin 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.950
 this makes it look more forward here 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.990
 we're going to touch up with a little bit of 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.740
 lacquer and we passed the comb to 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.740
 to perfect 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.270
 As you can see it looks very beautiful and the 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.340
 we can decorate for all occasions 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.410
