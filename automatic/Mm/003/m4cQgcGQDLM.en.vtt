football<00:00:18.230> game<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:18.860> was<00:00:19.010> meant<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.670> be

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
football game that was meant to be

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.460 
football game that was meant to be
played<00:00:20.000> on<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.240> pc<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:20.929> absolutely

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
played on the pc and absolutely

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.169 
played on the pc and absolutely
translated<00:00:21.830> into<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.580> four<00:00:22.789> things<00:00:23.029> we

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
translated into the the four things we

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.970 
translated into the the four things we
focused<00:00:23.570> on<00:00:23.689> most<00:00:23.900> this<00:00:24.080> year<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.769> first

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
be an impressive visual game second

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.790 
be an impressive visual game second
thing<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.480> controls<00:00:47.899> you've<00:00:48.469> gone<00:00:48.620> and

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
thing is the controls you've gone and

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.319 
thing is the controls you've gone and
thought<00:00:49.039> about<00:00:49.070> how<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.489> gameplay<00:00:50.120> could

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
thought about how the gameplay could

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.819 
thought about how the gameplay could
work<00:00:50.539> on<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.809> PC<00:00:51.289> different<00:00:51.620> than<00:00:51.710> other

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
work on a PC different than other

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.680 
work on a PC different than other
platforms<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.550> we've<00:00:52.640> actually<00:00:52.760> realized

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
platforms and we've actually realized

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.660 
platforms and we've actually realized
let's<00:00:54.109> use<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.410> most<00:00:54.620> as<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.070> control<00:00:55.489> input

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
let's use the most as a control input

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.250 
let's use the most as a control input
and<00:00:56.090> what<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.359> lets<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:56.660> do<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.899> it<00:00:57.019> lets<00:00:57.170> you

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
and what that lets you do is it lets you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.319 
and what that lets you do is it lets you
be<00:00:57.410> a<00:00:57.440> bit<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.739> more<00:00:57.949> of<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.100> field-marshal<00:00:58.519> go

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
be a bit of more of a field-marshal go

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.299 
be a bit of more of a field-marshal go
pointing<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.929> clicking<00:01:00.010> exactly<00:01:01.010> where<00:01:01.190> you

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
pointing and clicking exactly where you

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.009 
pointing and clicking exactly where you
want<00:01:01.489> your<00:01:01.579> passes<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.089> go<00:01:02.210> where<00:01:02.780> do<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:02.870> want

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
want your passes to go where do you want

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.229 
want your passes to go where do you want
your<00:01:03.109> teammates<00:01:03.469> to<00:01:03.649> run<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.190> or<00:01:04.460> who<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.059> want

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
your teammates to run to or who you want

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.550 
your teammates to run to or who you want
to<00:01:05.300> control<00:01:05.540> while<00:01:05.810> defending<00:01:06.230> so<00:01:06.410> it<00:01:06.470> gives

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
to control while defending so it gives

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.710 
to control while defending so it gives
you<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.740> lot<00:01:06.890> more<00:01:06.950> control<00:01:07.790> over<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.540> way<00:01:08.660> you

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
you a lot more control over the way you

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.900 
you a lot more control over the way you
play<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.200> game<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.190> third<00:01:10.400> area<00:01:10.550> we<00:01:10.730> worked

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
play the game the third area we worked

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.600 
play the game the third area we worked
on<00:01:11.090> is<00:01:11.240> around<00:01:11.330> connectivity<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:12.560> most<00:01:13.220> pcs

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
on is around connectivity so most pcs

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.190 
on is around connectivity so most pcs
are<00:01:13.640> connected<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.390> Internet<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:14.960> we

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
are connected to the Internet and we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.390 
are connected to the Internet and we
have<00:01:15.290> actually<00:01:15.560> taken<00:01:15.650> advantage<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.280> that

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
have actually taken advantage of that

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.980 
have actually taken advantage of that
fact<00:01:16.460> by<00:01:16.790> adding<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.180> widget<00:01:17.450> system

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
fact by adding a widget system

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.510 
fact by adding a widget system
throughout<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.290> front<00:01:18.620> end<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.010> game<00:01:19.190> so

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
throughout the front end of the game so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.340 
throughout the front end of the game so
no<00:01:19.880> matter<00:01:20.000> what<00:01:20.120> screen<00:01:20.570> you're<00:01:20.750> on<00:01:20.900> you'll

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
no matter what screen you're on you'll

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.480 
no matter what screen you're on you'll
have<00:01:21.440> little<00:01:21.740> bite-size<00:01:22.100> pieces<00:01:22.250> of

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
have little bite-size pieces of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.700 
have little bite-size pieces of
information<00:01:22.730> on<00:01:23.180> your<00:01:23.360> monitor<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.560> will<00:01:24.650> be

and I you get a red card automatically
but<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.600> couldn't<00:03:12.870> resist<00:03:13.260> too<00:03:13.530> many<00:03:13.710> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
but I just I couldn't resist too many so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.770 
but I just I couldn't resist too many so
many<00:03:14.010> times<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.670> end<00:03:14.850> up<00:03:15.000> slide<00:03:15.270> tackle<00:03:15.660> him

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
many times and I end up slide tackle him

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.680 
many times and I end up slide tackle him
I<00:03:15.960> would<00:03:16.530> laugh<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.190> hard<00:03:17.790> at<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.000> NIS<00:03:18.390> and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
I would laugh so hard at the NIS and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.000 
I would laugh so hard at the NIS and
then<00:03:18.810> I'd<00:03:18.960> obviously<00:03:19.470> have<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.650> fight<00:03:19.830> back

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
then I'd obviously have to fight back

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.290 
then I'd obviously have to fight back
after<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.490> for<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.670> rest<00:03:20.790> games<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.270> a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
after that for the rest games to be a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.960 
after that for the rest games to be a
man<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.560> was<00:03:22.740> definitely<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.220> fun

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
man down but that was definitely a fun

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.560 
man down but that was definitely a fun
memory<00:03:24.330> from<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.570> thief<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.320> past
