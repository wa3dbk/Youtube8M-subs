00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.760
 how are you in any case me it's going 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.739
 super good so january guys we get 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.750
 found for a new video and the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.519
 topic today what kind of 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.050
 player is you normally at the end of 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.430
 this video you will be made 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.379
 part of what type of player 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.089
 finally about if you do not know 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.010
 already already so I'm going quickly you 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.839
 introduce in a cape the data on 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.549
 me to strengthen and thank you 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.199
 for this more an accent we know 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:59.710
 modern warfare 3 in death match by 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.500
 team at acr 6.8 and it's a carnage 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.879
 it's a more than 50 it's all 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.340
 for the gameplay so we will attack 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.810
 directly the subject 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.610
 so for me there are three types of 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.470
 players on call of duty so everything 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.549
 first there is the search so if we 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.619
 can give him a little description 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.689
 it is he who will run in all 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.310
 sense with a smg weapon in order to 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.259
 destabilize his opponents 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.049
 finally he's going to run in any 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.930
 the map to help his teammates 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.100
 get some kills a little harder 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.040
 so here I am going to talk to you about the points 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.540
 positive searches firstly it 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.250
 is extremely effective on small 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.130
 view maps that will move a lot he the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.110
 will meet more players secondly 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.180
 it goes up in level faster in 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.510
 because of its number of eliminations more 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.510
 high 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.150
 thirdly their flesh is better 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.430
 that the majority of other types of 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.870
 players in one against one because good 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.490
 since it advances faster 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.400
 he has to master the techniques like 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.630
 the shot shot jump shot and all that so 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.320
 now we will talk about the points 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.510
 negative 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.430
 and yeah their flesh he has and I can 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.740
 to tell you that he has more than 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.150
 others firstly their tank did 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.130
 virtually no technique of 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.530
 timeout and gets killed a 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.030
 many times so when you 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.860
 fall with a record in your team 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.780
 you notice who makes a lot of kiel 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.230
 but for many of the dead also by 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.390
 example it's 30 22 or 30 24 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.379
 in short it's just an example so that 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.500
 that's the problem of some 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.939
 search secondly searches 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.180
 tend to have a level of rabies 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.530
 higher 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.599
 so simply it is enough that they 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.239
 fall on a bad part where the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.790
 people camp where he plays indented they 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.829
 are going to be chained and that's him 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.989
 is raging and so for the third 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.609
 negative point the rodents have some 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.260
 difficulties in making big series 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.730
 of eliminations what I mean by 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.409
 there it is by one when you search 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.239
 you are more likely to be 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.450
 get killed by a bad spawn or a 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.799
 camper who has not moved since 1990 and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170
 seen you rock you are often 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.030
 more advanced than your teammates whose 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.349
 you are often in their spawn and he 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.609
 can happen to you to get killed 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.560
 two backs when the enemies 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.569
 reappear and unfortunately the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.709
 fourth negative point is that they 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.150
 do not tend to play the goal 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.010
 so now let's talk about the second 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.419
 type of player and that's the goal 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.069
 player 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.810
 the objective besides is a very good 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.310
 communicator with a better 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.959
 knowledge of the game in terms of 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.400
 positioning of knowledge of 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.780
 cards which means they get 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.730
 move a lot more 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.459
 on the map and that it 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.769
 much time delay the player player a 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.280
 better winning ratio than all 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.319
 other players 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.329
 since he favors at all costs the 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.310
 victory so he really wants to win on 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.169
 will say that he plays only for that in 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.720
 last positive step they are very 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.099
 important in competitive match because 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.959
 that it is they who will direct their 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.359
 team and tell them what strategies 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.680
 used 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.409
 so we will go to the negative weight 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.120
 now the paying goals are 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.159
 bad in critical situations 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.169
 for example when they are in account 3 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.879
 or in one against one we will say that it is 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.560
 players who like to be in position 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.389
 favorable during a party 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.120
 when he finds himself alone they are 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.099
 often destabilized last point 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.769
 negative the objectives that elsewhere we 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.479
 tears and lower elimination seen 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.239
 that they will especially favor the goal 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.769
 is not the kills the last type of 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.419
 player is the passive player 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.039
 I call it that because it's the 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.810
 kind of person who bought his game 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.479
 only to play he plays everything 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.880
 simply for pure pleasure and 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.889
 royally fucks statistics or 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.930
 the brief community this is the kind of 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.620
 player who only plays to pass the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.370
 time finally they do not play often what 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.250
 unfortunately this kind of player to 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.900
 two negative points 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.320
 it can be disturbing for his team 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.060
 co 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.070
 its low level during foot a 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.200
 team that really wanted to win and to 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.960
 because of him for example they lose that 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.490
 can be really boring the second 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.040
 negative point unfortunately it's 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.560
 that they tend to camp and that that 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.190
 can be really boring but at a 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.290
 point 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.630
 in any case I speak in general 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.280
 so here I am, I would have talked about the three 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.730
 main types of players on call of 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.530
 duty 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.930
 in short it's true that I should have put 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.490
 first the camper but I think that 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.680
 you know it all this is the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.960
 guy who puts himself well at the bottom of the map 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.820
 in the short fern you see a little 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.910
 but it's not worth talking about 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.620
 him but you what kind of player is 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.360
 you do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.050
 comment I will read just like 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.940

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.520
