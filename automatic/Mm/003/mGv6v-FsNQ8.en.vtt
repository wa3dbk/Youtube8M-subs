00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.050 
good you know and I feel like it really
doesn't<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:43.290> also<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:44.060> greasy

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
doesn't do that it also is really greasy

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.510 
doesn't do that it also is really greasy
and<00:01:45.329> liquidy<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.409> put<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.799> not

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and liquidy when you put it on not

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
and liquidy when you put it on not
liquidy<00:01:48.119> necessarily<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:48.930> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.200> like

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
liquidy necessarily but kind of like

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.050 
liquidy necessarily but kind of like
yeah<00:01:49.799> yeah<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.250> bit<00:01:50.430> too<00:01:50.579> liquidy<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
yeah yeah a little bit too liquidy I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.300 
yeah yeah a little bit too liquidy I
guess<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
guess that's what I'm going for and I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.359 
guess that's what I'm going for and I
feel<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.350> applies<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
feel like it just it applies like a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.870 
feel like it just it applies like a
sunscreen<00:01:56.850> pretty<00:01:57.329> much<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> thin<00:01:58.880> oily

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
sunscreen pretty much like a thin oily

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.840 
sunscreen pretty much like a thin oily
sunscreen<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.130> don't<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.729> not

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
sunscreen I don't like that that's not

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.100 
sunscreen I don't like that that's not
my<00:02:03.030> favorite<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.479> would<00:02:03.540> rather<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
my favorite I would rather it be a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.010 
my favorite I would rather it be a
little<00:02:04.350> bit<00:02:04.439> thicker<00:02:04.860> consistency<00:02:06.020> not

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
little bit thicker consistency not

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
little bit thicker consistency not
necessarily<00:02:07.829> thick<00:02:08.129> act<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.789> thick<00:02:09.060> as

necessarily thick act like as thick as
the<00:02:09.330> foundation<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.170> understand

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the foundation because I understand

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.589 
the foundation because I understand
that's<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.640> but

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
that's like not what it's going for but

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.370 
that's like not what it's going for but
thicker

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
thicker

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.320
