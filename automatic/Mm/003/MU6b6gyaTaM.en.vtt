00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.379
 need for speed the run a match 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.379
 no one what is your feeling 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.880
 result because win while ron 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 we knew it was going to be difficult 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.949
 but we had come to take minimum 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.090
 a point and that's what we did I 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 think that's it to sum up the match 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.689
 the draw is logical because we have 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.609
 had opportunities they had 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.930
 opportunities also very good opportunities 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.210
 but we are happy with this point 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.320
 the space was very small the coach was 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.160
 warned the team that we knew 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.550
 we were not going to have a lot 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 of space that it was going to be difficult to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.500
 to play here to produce our football 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 as usual because there is no 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.989
 a lot of equipped who just won 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.109
 here we did a good 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.629
 delivery tactically I think and we 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.390
 so can can be happy indeed the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.110
 1st half more opportunities 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.850
 until the 38th minute the strike of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.619
 thorgan hazard web 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 it was a match France knew it 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.810
 was going to be a very tactical match and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 so with not a lot of opportunities and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.659
 beats for the purpose i see brian and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.960
 a lease that make calls on the side 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.600
 left and that allows me to get into 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.789
 the focused and I advance and I hit and she 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.960
 so it's my best goal 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.780
 month in time there is only May 3 but 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.939
 this is rex a nice goal is good 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.250
 pity we do not bring back the three 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.329
 points but it's always nice to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.380
 mark anyway I also saw thorgan 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.549
 hazard who played with a lot of daring 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.130
 it makes me happy that you say that like 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.890
 it costs will be happy I think because 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 he had asked me before the match of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.119
 to defend well on galitsios this because 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.969
 that they show a lot let annoying 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.409
 so we had to block this right side and 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.780
 I think we did it well 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.099
 tactically we were a little bit in 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.799
 second half where it was a little 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.829
 less well but as I say the 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:17.090
 main thing is to take a point here 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:20.390
 to finish the hazard was well at the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.930
 striking is today yeah that's for sure 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.819
 I had seen that eden had also scored 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.239
 low damage for the three points for 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.739
 us but I think that this will make me 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.780
 am glad to have scored him is 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.680
 happy to have scored I think the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.519
 family will be happy 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.340
 the parent confide yeah I hope for 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.060
 them if they are not doing it's so bad 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.200
 it's their problem 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.200
 OK, thanks
