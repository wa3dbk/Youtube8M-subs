00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.940 

I<00:00:10.340> guess<00:00:11.340> front<00:00:11.969> row<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.660> really<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.440> area

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
I guess front row is not really my area

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.029 
I guess front row is not really my area
of<00:00:14.400> expertise<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:15.770> and<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
of expertise but and it's a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.460 
of expertise but and it's a
much-maligned<00:00:17.420> position<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.930> Australia

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
much-maligned position in Australia

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.050 
much-maligned position in Australia
we've<00:00:19.680> had<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> problems<00:00:20.400> over<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> years<00:00:20.939> but

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
we've had of problems over the years but

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.660 
we've had of problems over the years but
i<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.750> get<00:00:21.869> our<00:00:21.990> number<00:00:22.320> one

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
i think if we can get our number one

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.640 
i think if we can get our number one
front<00:00:23.670> row<00:00:23.880> unit<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.689> pitch<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.529> it's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
front row unit on the pitch I think it's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.620 
front row unit on the pitch I think it's
been<00:00:25.830> showing<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.369> they're<00:00:26.640> very<00:00:26.670> capable

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
been showing that they're very capable

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.990 
been showing that they're very capable
and<00:00:27.840> very<00:00:27.960> competitive<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.769> I've<00:00:29.429> gone<00:00:29.730> for

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and very competitive so I've gone for

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.209 
and very competitive so I've gone for
what<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.689> number<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.170> sort<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.650> outfit

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
what I see the number one sort of outfit

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.319 
what I see the number one sort of outfit
which<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> Robinson<00:00:33.510> more<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.820> Alexander<00:00:35.820> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

that order 1 2 3 I've gone for stephen
moore<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.450> hooker<00:00:39.800> because<00:00:40.800> i<00:00:40.829> think<00:00:40.980> he's<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
moore at hooker because i think he's a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.010 
moore at hooker because i think he's a
very<00:00:41.520> experienced<00:00:42.030> plays<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.809> round

the<00:00:43.140> field<00:00:43.579> rather<00:00:44.579> than<00:00:45.320> pelota<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:46.590> who<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the field rather than pelota now who is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
the field rather than pelota now who is
a<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.550> explosive<00:00:47.910> player<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.260> feel

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a very explosive player but I just feel

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.060 
a very explosive player but I just feel
Steven<00:00:49.770> Moore's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.640> more

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
Steven Moore's a little bit more

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.310 
Steven Moore's a little bit more
reliable<00:00:53.070> at<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.850> stage<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.199> get

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
reliable at this stage so if we can get

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
reliable at this stage so if we can get
that<00:00:55.500> front<00:00:55.800> row<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> pitch<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.789> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
feel that that's a very competitive

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
feel that that's a very competitive
front<00:00:59.039> row<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> will<00:00:59.550> hold<00:00:59.730> its<00:00:59.910> own<00:01:00.000> against

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
a good leadership there in a very

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
a good leadership there in a very
popular<00:01:30.900> member<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> team<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.070> very

popular member of the team and a very
capable<00:01:32.790> player<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.540> he'll<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.799> rested

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
having not played for so long and I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
having not played for so long and I
think<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> whole<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.680> Australia<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.220> looking

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
think the whole of Australia is looking

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.980 
think the whole of Australia is looking
forward<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> having<00:01:39.119> him<00:01:39.390> back<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
forward to having him back the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.469 
forward to having him back the
background<00:01:40.439> Australia<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> key<00:01:42.299> area

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
background Australia is a key area

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.480 
background Australia is a key area
against<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> Lions<00:01:43.680> particularly<00:01:44.159> once<00:01:44.340> we

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
against the Lions particularly once we

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
against the Lions particularly once we
get<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:44.790> Australia<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> grounds<00:01:45.750> tend<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
get into Australia the grounds tend to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.780 
get into Australia the grounds tend to
be<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.320> bit<00:01:46.470> firmer<00:01:46.890> therefore<00:01:47.520> teams

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
be a little bit firmer therefore teams

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.639 
be a little bit firmer therefore teams
tend<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> move<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.540> ball<00:01:48.570> around<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
tend to move the ball around that the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.649 
tend to move the ball around that the
role<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> number<00:01:50.399> seven<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> very

role of the number seven is very

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.260 
role of the number seven is very

play<00:01:57.000> he<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.360> injured<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.750> little<00:01:57.990> bit<00:01:58.110> last

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
play he was injured a little bit last

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.620 
play he was injured a little bit last
year<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.920> his<00:01:59.399> replacement<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.119> Michael

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
year and his replacement was Michael

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.450 
year and his replacement was Michael
Hooper<00:02:00.990> who<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> look-alike<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.159> David

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
Hooper who is a look-alike for David

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
Hooper who is a look-alike for David
Pocock<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.119> very<00:02:03.299> difficult<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
Pocock and it's very difficult to to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.410 
Pocock and it's very difficult to to
leave<00:02:04.619> Michael<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.250> because<00:02:05.700> he<00:02:05.850> played<00:02:06.119> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
leave Michael out because he played so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.089 
leave Michael out because he played so
well<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> call<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.530> play<00:02:07.799> both<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
well and there is a call to play both of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.999 
well and there is a call to play both of
them<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:09.270> six<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.720> seven<00:02:10.080> which<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.830> make

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
them at six and seven which would make

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
them at six and seven which would make
it<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.520> very<00:02:11.819> fast<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
it a very very fast and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.630 
it a very very fast and
added<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.110> back<00:02:13.350> row<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.770> only<00:02:14.010> problem<00:02:14.430> there

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
added a back row the only problem there

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.490 
added a back row the only problem there
is<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:15.000> missing<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.420> lineout<00:02:15.660> jumper<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
is we're missing a lineout jumper and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380 
is we're missing a lineout jumper and
that's<00:02:17.100> probably<00:02:17.310> where<00:02:17.580> I'd<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.120> Scott

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that's probably where I'd go for Scott

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.660 
that's probably where I'd go for Scott
Higginbotham<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> blind<00:02:19.530> side<00:02:20.130> flank<00:02:20.550> at

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
Higginbotham on the blind side flank at

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.850 
Higginbotham on the blind side flank at
number<00:02:20.970> six<00:02:21.240> because<00:02:21.569> he's<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> big<00:02:22.080> fellow

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
number six because he's a big fellow

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.280 
number six because he's a big fellow
good<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.850> line<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.270> aggressive<00:02:24.959> tough

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
good in the line out aggressive tough

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.630 
good in the line out aggressive tough
and<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.650> need<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.130> sort<00:02:26.610> of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and you need to have that sort of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.699 
and you need to have that sort of
element<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.600> think<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> balance<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.470> him

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
element and I think the balance with him

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.860 
element and I think the balance with him
and<00:02:28.920> Pocock<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.880> six<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.270> seven<00:02:30.569> is<00:02:30.630> quite

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
and Pocock at six and seven is quite

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.750 
and Pocock at six and seven is quite
good<00:02:31.110> with<00:02:31.230> maybe<00:02:31.500> Michael<00:02:31.980> Hooper<00:02:32.310> coming<00:02:32.640> on

position<00:03:37.739> I've<00:03:38.160> opted<00:03:38.549> for<00:03:38.760> Quade<00:03:38.940> Cooper<00:03:38.970> has

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
position I've opted for Quade Cooper has

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.020

had his troubles over the last 18 months

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.789 
had his troubles over the last 18 months
or<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:42.480> both<00:03:42.840> on<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.170> off<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.320> field<00:03:43.470> he<00:03:43.769> got

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
or so both on and off the field he got

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.740 
or so both on and off the field he got
injured<00:03:44.070> at<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.400> world<00:03:44.579> cup<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.299> playoff

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
injured at the world cup in the playoff

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.590 
injured at the world cup in the playoff
between<00:03:45.930> third<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.530> fourth<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.329> feel

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
between third and fourth and I just feel

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.690 
between third and fourth and I just feel
that<00:03:48.870> he<00:03:49.019> adds<00:03:49.230> something<00:03:49.560> extra<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.400> he<00:03:50.549> can

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
that he adds something extra if he can

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.759 
that he adds something extra if he can
get<00:03:50.850> back<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.209> full<00:03:51.420> fitness<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:52.079> playing

like<00:03:53.040> me<00:03:53.220> now<00:03:53.370> he<00:03:53.430> can<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.940> think<00:03:54.180> at<00:03:54.299> 10<00:03:54.600> he's<00:03:55.350> a

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
like me now he can I think at 10 he's a

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.380 
like me now he can I think at 10 he's a
match<00:03:55.709> winner<00:03:56.010> yeah<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.579> defense's<00:03:57.180> is

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
match winner yeah the defense's is

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.000 
match winner yeah the defense's is
something<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.989> it's<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.350> bit<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.620> question

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
something of it's a bit of a question

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.890 
something of it's a bit of a question
along<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.459> three-quarter<00:04:00.030> line<00:04:00.180> break

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
along that three-quarter line break

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.180 
along that three-quarter line break
bonds<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.350> don't<00:04:01.530> think<00:04:01.680> there's<00:04:01.829> much<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.010> a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
bonds I don't think there's much of a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.160 
bonds I don't think there's much of a
question<00:04:02.340> about<00:04:02.609> him<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.030> ex<00:04:03.180> rugby<00:04:03.989> league

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
question about him and ex rugby league

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.020 
question about him and ex rugby league
players<00:04:04.500> tackles<00:04:05.220> very<00:04:05.400> well<00:04:05.670> he's<00:04:05.850> got<00:04:06.000> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
players tackles very well he's got a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.729 
players tackles very well he's got a
very<00:04:06.269> good<00:04:06.450> technique<00:04:06.900> when<00:04:07.109> I<00:04:07.170> see<00:04:07.350> Barnes

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
very good technique when I see Barnes

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.580 
very good technique when I see Barnes
and<00:04:07.890> Cooper<00:04:08.160> swapping<00:04:08.549> quite<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.790> bit<00:04:09.590> between

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
and Cooper swapping quite a bit between

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.340 
and Cooper swapping quite a bit between
10<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:10.950> 12<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.459> think<00:04:11.670> it'd<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> fairly<00:04:12.180> young

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
10 and 12 I think it'd be a fairly young

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.560 
10 and 12 I think it'd be a fairly young
fluid<00:04:13.350> arrangement<00:04:14.010> there<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.880> then<00:04:15.269> at

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
fluid arrangement there so then at

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.779 
fluid arrangement there so then at
outside<00:04:16.350> centre<00:04:16.380> at<00:04:16.739> 13<00:04:17.130> I'd<00:04:17.310> probably<00:04:17.519> have

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
outside centre at 13 I'd probably have

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.150 
outside centre at 13 I'd probably have
Adam<00:04:18.299> ashley-cooper<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:19.049> think<00:04:19.500> that's<00:04:19.950> his

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
Adam ashley-cooper I think that's his

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.680 
Adam ashley-cooper I think that's his
best<00:04:20.340> position<00:04:20.579> that's<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.209> position<00:04:21.359> he

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
best position that's the position he

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.270 
best position that's the position he
likes<00:04:21.989> playing<00:04:22.229> he's<00:04:23.130> very<00:04:23.490> well<00:04:23.729> respected

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
likes playing he's very well respected

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.520 
likes playing he's very well respected
amongst<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.389> rugby<00:04:26.720> community<00:04:27.200> with<00:04:27.380> these

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
amongst the rugby community with these

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.440 
amongst the rugby community with these
defense<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.130> also<00:04:28.430> for<00:04:28.580> his<00:04:28.700> powerfull<00:04:29.030> fend

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
defense and also for his powerfull fend

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.450 
defense and also for his powerfull fend
and<00:04:29.690> running<00:04:29.990> with<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.139> ball<00:04:30.410> so<00:04:30.980> those<00:04:31.130> three

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
and running with the ball so those three

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.730 
and running with the ball so those three
I<00:04:31.610> think<00:04:31.970> would<00:04:32.120> be<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> threat<00:04:32.600> in<00:04:33.020> attack<00:04:33.440> to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
I think would be a threat in attack to

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.200 
I think would be a threat in attack to
the<00:04:33.860> opposition<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.460> think<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.760> lines<00:04:34.970> would

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
the opposition I think the lines would

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.780 
the opposition I think the lines would
take<00:04:35.480> notice<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.260> them<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.620> need<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:37.040> really

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
take notice of them and need to really

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.150 
take notice of them and need to really
defend<00:04:38.090> quite<00:04:38.419> strongly<00:04:39.169> against<00:04:39.830> them<00:04:39.980> but

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
defend quite strongly against them but

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.850 
defend quite strongly against them but
also<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:41.720> big<00:04:41.960> thing<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.410> they've<00:04:42.560> got<00:04:42.740> to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
also the big thing that they've got to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.340 
also the big thing that they've got to
do<00:04:43.010> particularly<00:04:43.700> with<00:04:43.910> big<00:04:44.120> centers<00:04:44.660> running

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
do particularly with big centers running

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.260 
do particularly with big centers running
at<00:04:45.500> them<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:45.980> big<00:04:46.220> sort<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.580> flankers<00:04:47.060> and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
at them and big sort of flankers and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.270 
at them and big sort of flankers and
forwards<00:04:48.200> running<00:04:48.500> at<00:04:48.620> particularly

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
forwards running at particularly

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.460 
forwards running at particularly
Cooper's<00:04:49.700> channel<00:04:50.120> they<00:04:50.840> need<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.169> really

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
Cooper's channel they need to really

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.560 
Cooper's channel they need to really
have<00:04:51.620> their<00:04:51.800> defense<00:04:52.160> well<00:04:52.370> organized<00:04:52.820> yeah<00:04:53.540> i

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
have their defense well organized yeah i

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.390 
have their defense well organized yeah i
think<00:04:53.840> our<00:04:53.990> back<00:04:54.169> three<00:04:54.500> Australia's<00:04:55.190> back

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
think our back three Australia's back

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.210 
think our back three Australia's back
three<00:04:55.700> potentially<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.480> a<00:04:56.510> is<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.080> weapon<00:04:57.410> for

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
three potentially is a is a weapon for

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.740 
three potentially is a is a weapon for
us<00:04:58.400> I've<00:04:59.390> gone<00:04:59.690> for<00:05:00.020> Digby<00:05:00.440> ione<00:05:00.770> on<00:05:01.040> one<00:05:01.370> wing

Beale<00:05:04.250> at<00:05:04.580> fullback<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.890> think<00:05:06.890> all<00:05:07.010> three<00:05:07.340> of

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
Beale at fullback I think all three of

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.850 
Beale at fullback I think all three of
them<00:05:07.580> are<00:05:08.120> very<00:05:08.330> good<00:05:08.600> ball<00:05:08.780> carriers<00:05:09.230> very

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
them are very good ball carriers very

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.800 
them are very good ball carriers very
dangerous<00:05:10.490> when<00:05:10.940> they've<00:05:11.090> got<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.390> ball<00:05:11.570> in

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
dangerous when they've got the ball in

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.120 
dangerous when they've got the ball in
their<00:05:12.200> own<00:05:12.320> right<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.740> three<00:05:12.950> of<00:05:12.980> them

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
their own right and the three of them
