&gt;&gt;MARK: Hi, I' Mark Perry the creator of BuiltLean
and today I'm gonna show you

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.530
the athletic stance, which will help you

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.830
maximize your strength while minimizing
injury while you work out.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.160
And so, what is an athletic stance?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.810
An athletic stance is a standing position
where you help maximize your strength, speed

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.080
and power. And depending on the sport you're
playing,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.680
and athletic stance might be different.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.449
And so, with weight lifting, I think there
are

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.019
five components that you should really take
into account,

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.670
number one is you wanna keep your head straight,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.370
you wanna keep your shoulders, back and chest
out,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.760
and also you wanna keep your knees slightly

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.850
bent. So you don't wanna bend them too much,
you don't want your legs to be straight,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.980
that's the most important thing,
keeping a slight bend on your knees.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.379
You also want to have a flat to
slightly arched lower back.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.890
Not too much arched, but slightly arched.
And then finally

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.600
is you wanna keep your feet flat against
the ground so there's not too much pressure

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.890
on your heel, or your toes, it's just
a light pressure on the ground.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.250
And so, I'm gonna be demonstrating a
couple exercises for you to give you a sense

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.380
of

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.400
what the athletic stance looks like,
while you exercise.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.930
And so, the first exercise is the standing
dumbbell overhead press.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.670
And I think this is one in particular
were a lot of people end up hurting

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.030
their lower backs.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.520
And the reason is because

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.670
they do not keep slightly bent knees and so
that's really the key is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.950
slightly bending your knees whenever you're
doing anything over your head,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.470
any overhead presses.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.020
And so, sometimes when people do a
standing press,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.450
they'll excessively arch their backs backwards
which is what ends up hurting their lower

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.180
backs.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.200
Another exercise is the standing
barbell curl

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.750
or dumbbell curl where you can use a lot of
body angles to help the weight up

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.070
and you could end up throwing out your
lower back.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.630
If you bend your knees however, it's gonna
prevent you from using a successive

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.009
range of motion, and it's gonna make the exercise
a lot safer and a lot more effective

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.680
to work, you know, the targeted muscles.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.719
And then finally, even Olympic movements,
let's

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.880
just say like a Hang Clean,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.600
you doing a hang clean, when you
catch the barbell,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.030
you want to have a slight bend on
your knees to help prevent

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.950
any injuries to your lower back
or your knees.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.290
And again, athletic stance is
absolutely key

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.290
when you're lifting to help minimize
injury and improve your strength and power,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.930
and just so you know, I'm gonna be embbeding

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.150
with a little bit more detail
in case you want some more information

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.540
thanks again for watching and look
foward to see you soon!
