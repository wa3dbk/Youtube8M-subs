00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.580
 What's up, the guys? 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.200
 applications and then talk to you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.750
 some battery saving tips 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.330
 of iphone 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 the first tip of the province to save 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.470
 the battery is about the update option of the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 background how's it going 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.990
 the Justice 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.750
 You go down and go in general. 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.480
 an you go who appeared in second 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.070
 next plan how does it work know 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 those applications that stay open 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.239
 but you are not using them then 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.640
 they are all the time updating 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.620
 automatically ends up here in 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.330
 low battery because then you will do 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.780
 you can just get here and 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.670
 disable this option only one caveat 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 some applications require this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.900
 option on then that will make you 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 will turn off only those who really 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.890
 They do not need the ones I tell them they need. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 are those location app 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.559
 between people like this one. 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.260
 live and 61 friends the next tip will give 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.159
 For you how to save battery is 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.320
 disabling the maximum possible 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.290
 notifications that I will make without adjustments 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.049
 which was already facing the notifications and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.060
 and give in and if those applications that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.189
 had notifications have some 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 You do not need, for example, like this one. 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.250
 then comes the application that I 'm going to do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.900
 I'll go into it you enable all 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.700
 options and notifications I'm not going 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.829
 receive more if you save more battery 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.240
 how much more civilian objectives is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.240
 I did it but I did not 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.179
 proof that it gives you is about the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.710
 location service you spent 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:47.159
 enough battery you come here in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:51.149
 fits and comes and privacy down here 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.890
 and here's beer location next 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.380
 many applications using the service 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.210
 of location that ends up consuming 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.159
 really a little bit of battery 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.679
 only that most of them do not really 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.259
 Accurate because facebook is going to ask for your 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.450
 location postava posted from such place 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.819
 but it feels because you make you 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.289
 turns off these nutrients and leaves 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.490
 those using gps that are 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.680
 important in my opinion for example 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.050
 google maps or friends 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.240
 abu su now the result you can leave 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.090
 off you will save enough 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.430
 drums 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.440
 the next tip to save more 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.310
 battery and turning off the local option 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.319
 frequent 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.940
 You go first place you went to 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.150
 Last time when you were disabled 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.069
 location features 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:39.950
 You go to court then I came here. 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.620
 privacy location service will 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.640
 say it all appears services 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.280
 system is what will follow appear 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.739
 several options down here the locations 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.599
 frequency this more frequent option 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.549
 memorize places you visit 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.680
 often for example here 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.180
 here I click on the history to appear 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.870
 all the places that I go there and visits 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.380
 frequent 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.230
 Only this memorization happens. 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.250
 by spending enough battery to advantage 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.750
 leave it on is that it saves power and 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.370
 said that it provides information 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.920
 location are usually related 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.569
 more related ads ads the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.099
 What do you do? 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.500
 Only I particularly think 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.510
 unnecessary then I'll hang up 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.750
 frequent places to save more 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.269
 battery too I would advise disconnecting 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.579
 This is vocalization disc too. 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.670
 ads with update and not accurate 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.220
 I do not like this ad in the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.780
 next now almost does not know but will 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.900
 that someone does not, so I decided to put 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.790
 No video goes to court. 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.980
 and then you will remember that there are four 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.319
 tools four things you consume 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.400
 pretty battery 3g or 4g wifi bluetooth 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.889
 and the phone itself 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.079
 the following if you at a time of 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.160
 need to turn off one of them will go 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.139
 teach you how to do it 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.510
 in case you need to turn 3g off 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.530
 put the battery you come fit 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.959
 cell phone 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.060
 he comes here to turn off the cell phones 3g 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:15.470
 ready tactical 3g connection and back in 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.150
 help if you want to turn off your grief 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.590
 what you really do not need to use 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.840
 all the time he's wasting battery 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.639
 when turned on only come many off 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.129
 great 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.479
 back to al faifi other than a sound 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:30.210
 You would not have enough then when you 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.250
 Are you thinking already in Senegal? 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.879
 save a lot of battery too no 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.569
 ef 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:38.940
 disconnect the link in the last instance you 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.849
 has the ability to connect airplane mode it 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.159
 will activate almost all signals 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.979
 including the phone, then you'll save 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.509
 really enough battery now fact is 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.340
 that there are many people who use the 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.180
 sleeping airplane that really is a 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.770
 good idea 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.330
 God is going to save the cell phone battery. 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.190
 and no one will bother you the last day 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.680
 that I have for you were already know 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.060
 but I think the video here is essential 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.220
 so this will do and will get your 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.919
 finger will put down here drag 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.810
 Up will open this ball and that 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.319
 you will have the brightness option you can 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.449
 increase or decrease the bb states that the 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.509
 reduce the brightness you're saving 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.340
 enough battery so people are just that 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.169
