let's<00:01:05.119> start<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.869> race<00:01:06.579> and<00:01:08.109> what<00:01:09.109> you<00:01:09.229> can

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.620 
see is that things like smoke for
example<00:01:14.869> let's<00:01:15.729> try<00:01:16.729> that<00:01:16.969> again

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
example let's try that again

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:27.399 
example let's try that again
I<00:01:20.560> think<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.770> just<00:01:24.850> do<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.420> what<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:27.229> can

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
I think I just do that and what you can

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.169 
I think I just do that and what you can
see<00:01:27.439> is<00:01:27.890> smoke<00:01:28.369> here<00:01:29.829> looks<00:01:30.829> actually<00:01:31.729> pretty

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
see is smoke here looks actually pretty

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:39.339 
see is smoke here looks actually pretty
good<00:01:35.020> looks<00:01:36.250> pretty<00:01:37.250> realistic<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.360> then

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
good looks pretty realistic and then

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:45.179 
good looks pretty realistic and then
things<00:01:39.649> like<00:01:42.489> those<00:01:43.489> blurred<00:01:44.090> stripes

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
things like those blurred stripes

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.190 
things like those blurred stripes
I'll<00:01:46.189> look<00:01:46.489> do<00:01:47.299> look<00:01:47.539> awesome

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
I'll look do look awesome

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.449

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
and again the smoke and look at the

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.709 
and again the smoke and look at the
smoothness<00:01:53.239> of<00:01:54.069> the<00:01:55.069> gameplay

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
smoothness of the gameplay

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.209 
smoothness of the gameplay
there's<00:01:56.719> no<00:01:57.020> lagging<00:01:58.090> nothing<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.299> just<00:01:59.599> runs

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
there's no lagging nothing it just runs

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.569 
there's no lagging nothing it just runs
smoothly<00:02:01.219> and<00:02:02.560> then<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.679> level<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.129> details

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
smoothly and then the level of details

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.550 
smoothly and then the level of details
for<00:02:04.909> example<00:02:07.090> right<00:02:08.090> here<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.750> horizon<00:02:09.319> looks

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
for example right here the horizon looks

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.650 
for example right here the horizon looks
great

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660

IGI<00:02:11.660> i<00:02:11.840> think<00:02:12.319> i<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.500> chose<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.760> wrong<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
IGI i think i just chose the wrong the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.789 
IGI i think i just chose the wrong the
wrong<00:02:15.859> race<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:16.880> like<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.420> deathmatch<00:02:18.260> right

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
wrong race it's like in deathmatch right

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.960 
wrong race it's like in deathmatch right
here<00:02:19.359> but<00:02:20.359> the<00:02:20.870> sunset<00:02:21.530> looks<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.670> really

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970
