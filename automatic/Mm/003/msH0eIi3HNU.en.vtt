00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.530

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.800
 he is abdul dead as by chance 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.019
 okay there is another trophy if 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.239
 it is written in this prophecy the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.030
 calq and author that he will receive the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.610

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.830
 age 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.170
 when you want more than that that's 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.790
 Buddhism is before even the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.650
 Judaism and Christianity 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.330
 which means that the first 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.819
 religion that existed 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.680
 it was the religion of Islam but the 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.959
 devil is the falsified asset how 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.049
 this the religion of Islam so I 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.040
 am going to ask me a question to the jews 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.320
 my cousins 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.200
 what is your religion Judaism 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.870
 remember the word Judaism it comes from 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.090
 peephole does not benefit peephole iscariot who 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.630
 came with his treacherous horizon 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.000
 peephole the prophet who came for them 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.850
 kings of israel to put them back on the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.100
 right way then I'm going to ask you 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.560
 a question is what abraham abraham 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.000
 who gave birth who gave 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.370
 birth you have religion 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.930
 from Abraham who gave birth to isa qua 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.000
 with sarah so I want to know how 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.430
 it's called the name of the religion of 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.400
 abraham is what Judaism and the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.010
 Judaism become after 400 years after ben 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.750
 hammam it came with peephole so 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.390
 abraham can not have the name of the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.580
 Judaism only in name to his religion or else 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.280
 to his skin so how do they call it 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.190
 the religion of Abraham and in the Jews 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.370
 the scholars of the Jews they say the 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.060
 religion of abraham it is ch lama that 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.290
 me like chalon proclaims if I write this 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.660
 me in Arabic 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.210
 Well, I'll write this to me 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.880
 khalif of the end that's because the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.480
 extend the ifa the end if I 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.360
 put back at the beginning it will give islam 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.930
 it becomes Islam that is to say we have the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.410
 same religion is island the beginning this 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.410
 Islam 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.330
 why because look good if we 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.460
 ask Christians what is your 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.470
 religion christianity everything what there 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.960
 is called Christianity because the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.810
 christ our god or the son of 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.150
 god he was killed on the cross said it's 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.310
 Christianity so Christ is a 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.040
 character we ask the toys 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.010
 plush Judaism the peephole peephole too 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.310
 it's a prophet it's a it was this 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.060
 then announces and if we ask the 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.540
 Buddhists 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.210
 what is your religion Buddhism 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.830
 also buddha it was a name if we 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.030
 ask Muslims what is your 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.920
 religion s 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:56.050
 they will say our religion is me 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.950
 told me no we say Islam that makes sense 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.990
 What does it mean 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.790
 islam a lot of people they will answer 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.330
 they will say to Islam that means the 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.960
 peace no peace this is the one we have 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.590
 deal with Islam it's not the same heat 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.780
 it's Islam because it's not the one 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.780
 then Islam is a word
