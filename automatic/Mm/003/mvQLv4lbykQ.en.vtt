00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.220
 hello today make the metal rings that are used to hold together 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.799
 wrongdoing I generally made by hand 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.799
 and here now let's see what it is 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.490
 here is the material we will need 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.189
 up to half 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.460
 no I really mean, 8 but it's fine even by a millimeter maybe emilio tinta 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.460
 greater the file by a millimeter 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.790
 cutter like this changes the side one of the flat dishes 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.230
 and therefore consequently make a flat dolphin cut 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.940
 another fake like this I return to wrap the thread to create the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 anellini vedita classic pliers with round tips 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.139
 or as an alternative 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.349
 a pint like this that pretends that the three positions 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.190
 There are three different sizes of rings 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.620
 or again 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.729
 you can use any concert for daily use 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.630
 change size and shape that that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.679
 you prefer this crochet handle, for example 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.360
 take a closer look at the scenes 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 you see 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.520
 these have shouted that the net clown at 90 degrees you see of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 dish ie 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.920
 while on the other side of Italy at 45 degrees so if the battery is morning and there 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 we cut it this way 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.860
 potter - a cut. 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.720
 pointed 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.100
 the sharp wire is not exactly the best pine to use in general 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.719
 in the same technique if preferred it prefers to have a cut 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.900
 carried out with the mother's side 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.290
 plant and then an almost finished cut of dish 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.930
 united 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.250
 There are various types of linear ballerina cuts that have the double blade that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.929
 they make a double cut 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.609
 right both here and now 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.789
 and it serves for those who work really very many years - road cut wav in da 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:16.759
 to cut 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.989
 you might not find on the market not very easily there anyway 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:21.790
 pliers like this 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.119
 that's fine 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.119
 but these are the plastics. . it on me 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:32.859
 and this relatively little fifth from if you already have otherwise if you no longer have 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.179
 if so 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.349
 hahaha any object of daily use at no cost 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.569
 give a piece of thread like this for example 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.079
 I grab a collar end 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.419
 in the with the jaws of the dyes is in a precise point I for example will do 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.779
 rings 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.709
 but big room then 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.790
 take this last part of the jaws into consideration 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.619
 I then wait and start to 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:06.280
 bite the hand that holds the pint in this manner by sliding 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.649
 re the movie 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:09.869
 you see 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.389
 initial pool 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.990
 this position always remains in order to have rings 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.869
 of the same size 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.399
 that is, I don't move here you see 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.399
 I remain in this position 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.549
 and I keep slipping the son 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.459
 moment only the scenes 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.029
 in one hand and say so in this world I make a certain number of those rings 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.229
 what I need 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.629
 and then I stop 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.819
 we made a kind of ica 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.710
 you see 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.320
 times we will cut the rings in italiam a piece we cut here 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.830
 and see how close you are 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.309
 they cut the lambs 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.309
 here is angelica that I formatted see 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.039
 to all the rings of the same size 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:08.799
 and two pieces of thread start the text-shaped photo end in a circular shape so I can 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.399
 cut them I can delete them 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:15.849
 keeping in mind that from now on all the cuts we will make will always be with the 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.649
 or side of the flat pliers facing away from the small villas that we have to form 

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.419
 there we must use this side of the pizza 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.419
 so let's also remove these needless food 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:28.990
 doing so 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.909
 coupon 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.909
 the first Italian part also the tail 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.719
 Meritene 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:41.520
 now I can begin to make skype the first ring 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 this cut which you then see is flat 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.150
 and net 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.710
 so even second by cutting it down to do to get this 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.050
 what should I turn Cagliari thinks its second child in this world 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.110
 province looted towards the avellino here 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.810
 in this way both titans will be united and therefore perfectly 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.620
 combacianti 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.110
 now this naturally unkind dish name because the pizza was 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.629
 turned in this way 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.529
 so loris pironi just trim it just enough to have a cut 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.139
 dish. 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.939
 after which I repeat what I have done so far around the pint 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.939
 cut to the next avellino 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.099
 continue in this way perry fisi aoc see cut so I love you 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:36.299
 turn the dye and also cut the next ring 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.809
 I wanted to show you the millino hoping that you see enough 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.120
 that the metals fit together 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.210
 again I take the handicap 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.989
 and continuous raisport size a little more effort because to show the meat 

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:59.119
 of course a place to cut 

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:02.569
 withdrawal 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.569
 and cutting 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:09.369
 son 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.369
 the change came almost to the end 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.830
 for the thread 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.300
 around la pinsa italiaincontri 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.530
 what advances what of course is not perfectly and 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.960
 close we can remove it 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.330
 how to delete it from the series - 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.240
 here are the rings and just formed 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.800
 I hope all reality is liked I hope you can come back useful bye 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.770
 meadow 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.580
 Yup
