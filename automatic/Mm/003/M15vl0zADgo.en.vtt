00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
welcome to challenge two so I knew that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.040 
welcome to challenge two so I knew that
the<00:00:44.910> piece<00:00:45.030> would<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.420> Drake<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.900> was

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the piece would have to Drake that was

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.530 
the piece would have to Drake that was
that<00:00:46.290> was<00:00:46.700> clear<00:00:47.700> from<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:47.970> beginning

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
that was clear from the very beginning

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.870 
that was clear from the very beginning
and<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.020> immediately<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.980> thought<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.550> linen

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
and so immediately I thought of linen

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.720 
and so immediately I thought of linen
stitch<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.420> barn<00:00:52.380> on<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.980> favorite<00:00:53.490> stitch

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
stitch it is barn on my favorite stitch

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.050 
stitch it is barn on my favorite stitch
ever<00:00:54.230> yes<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.500> labor<00:00:55.739> intensive<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.489> its

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
ever yes it is labor intensive but its

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.930 
ever yes it is labor intensive but its
strength<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.110> durability<00:00:58.650> its<00:00:59.489> ability<00:00:59.910> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
strength is durability its ability to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
strength is durability its ability to
drape<00:01:00.239> simultaneously<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> different

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
drape simultaneously in different

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.319 
drape simultaneously in different
directions<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.730> fact<00:01:02.880> that<00:01:02.940> looks<00:01:03.149> great

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
directions and the fact that looks great

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.980 
directions and the fact that looks great
on<00:01:03.570> both<00:01:03.600> sides<00:01:04.339> amazing<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:06.840> locked

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
on both sides amazing that I was locked

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.490 
on both sides amazing that I was locked
in<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.729> for<00:01:08.729> inspiration<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.229> linens

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
in to for inspiration because of linens

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
in to for inspiration because of linens
ditch<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.860> immediately<00:01:11.190> went<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> Turkish

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
ditch I immediately went to Turkish

ditch I immediately went to Turkish
textiles<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.920> also<00:01:14.370> a<00:01:14.400> no-brainer<00:01:14.760> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
textiles that was also a no-brainer for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.280 
textiles that was also a no-brainer for
me<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.870> some<00:01:16.050> examples<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> those<00:01:18.290> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
me here are some examples of those this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
me here are some examples of those this
one<00:01:19.620> while<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.760> quite<00:01:20.940> different<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
one while it's quite different from the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.789 
one while it's quite different from the
others<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.810> couldn't<00:01:22.170> pull<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.440> out<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.620> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
others I couldn't pull it out of the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.580 
others I couldn't pull it out of the
inspiration<00:01:23.430> mix<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.350> realized<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
inspiration mix I realized it was the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.420 
inspiration mix I realized it was the
marine<00:01:25.979> blue<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.640> brought<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.940> certain<00:01:27.450> dark

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
marine blue that brought a certain dark

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.250 
marine blue that brought a certain dark
intensity<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.580> certain<00:01:30.090> luminosity<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.049> very

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
intensity a certain luminosity in a very

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.560 
intensity a certain luminosity in a very
deep<00:01:31.530> tone<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.640> had<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.060> thrown<00:01:33.270> into<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
deep tone that had to be thrown into the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.740 
deep tone that had to be thrown into the
mix<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.830> i<00:01:34.860> went<00:01:35.190> ahead<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> i<00:01:35.670> ordered<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
mix so i went ahead and i ordered the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.080

pipes here and this beautiful arc I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.550 
pipes here and this beautiful arc I
thought<00:02:55.510> I'll<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.750> make<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.140> are<00:02:56.350> keen<00:02:56.530> to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
thought I'll just make that are keen to

the<00:02:56.740> bottom<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.070> piece<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.520> then<00:02:57.790> I

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
the bottom of the piece and then I

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.280 
the bottom of the piece and then I
realize<00:02:58.180> know<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.450> must<00:02:58.690> be<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.840> straight<00:02:59.110> line

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
realize know it must be a straight line

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.130 
realize know it must be a straight line
the<00:02:59.970> pliability<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.330> fabric<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> draping

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the pliability of the fabric the draping

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.350 
the pliability of the fabric the draping
as<00:03:02.440> well<00:03:03.040> as<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.340> individual<00:03:03.880> body<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.270> is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
as well as the individual body that is

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.450 
as well as the individual body that is
on<00:03:04.540> will<00:03:04.840> determine<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.410> actual<00:03:05.740> course<00:03:06.220> of

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
on will determine the actual course of

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.800 
on will determine the actual course of
that<00:03:06.610> arc<00:03:06.880> but<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.900> will<00:03:08.080> arc<00:03:08.320> nonetheless<00:03:08.620> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
that arc but it will arc nonetheless and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.450 
that arc but it will arc nonetheless and
so<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:11.880> got<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:12.970> idea<00:03:13.090> how<00:03:13.540> do<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.690> make<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.170> I

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
so I got the idea how do I make this I

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.949 
so I got the idea how do I make this I
got<00:03:15.460> some<00:03:16.080> old<00:03:17.080> crushed<00:03:17.710> velvet<00:03:18.570> did<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.600> very
