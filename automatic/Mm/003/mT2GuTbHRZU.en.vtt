00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.630
 he does it to wrap the avocado and he's going to 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.030
 help and not only in the taste but in the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.820
 color also with protection is a 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:50.160
 protection that we are putting to the 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.590
 natural palm but good that you 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.100
 you have in your house you want to put cheese 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.100

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.490
 result is like what we have there what 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.290
 let's go with a creampie that I 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.200
 I put it Mediterranean so it has 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.150
 because it has black olives basil and 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.490
 has a bit of fresh tomato this is 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.790
 a little bit cooler than it is a salad 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.790
 russian 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.979
 for all the people who are not to be 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.409
 about ham so that so you can 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.970
 cover it well because you remember that this is 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.470
 oxidizes the avocado oxidizes though he 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.169
 we have put lemon then always 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.639
 well covered you can go to the refrigerator 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.639
 two hours or the freezer 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:54.539
 with half an hour of freezer is already 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.539
 finished look what 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.289
 molded look tomato accompaniment 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.270
 fresh cut in olives cubes 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.460
 black that this who does not like this 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.190
 this rich where you look at basil 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.409
 a lot of chopped basil, salt, pepper and a 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.900
 good white cheese is that it can be light 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.240
 or not depending on how the new calorie is 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.310
 according to how people have cholesterol 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.169
 also because this means that 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.030
 we want to subtract fat to take care of 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.800
 health if we put a low-fat cheese 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.610
 our portions we can not eat from 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.379
 this opportunity 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.379
 and one for 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.480
 It is very healthy 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:01.020
 riquelme of the kitchen 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:04.330
 riquelme of the kitchen there is an artist 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.490

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.930

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:15.750
 24 because the truth is that it's a recipe 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:27.360

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:27.360

 and now I tell them throughout the country they 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.849
 produce intermittent rains of 

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:54.099
 plugs to know why is that the 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:57.539
 meteorological phenomenon is triggered by 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.539
