also my HTC mobile phone and to charge
your<00:02:32.790> device<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.780> simply<00:02:34.260> pop<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.980> onto<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
your device we simply pop that onto the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.730 
your device we simply pop that onto the
base<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.350> iPhone

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
base and as you can see the iPhone

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.520 
base and as you can see the iPhone
started<00:02:38.280> charging<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.910> then<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:39.990> pop<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
started charging and then I can pop the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.760 
started charging and then I can pop the
HTC<00:02:41.520> magic<00:02:42.330> onto<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.020> pause<00:02:43.290> at<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> back

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
HTC magic onto that pause at the back

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.160 
HTC magic onto that pause at the back
and<00:02:44.460> we've<00:02:44.610> got<00:02:44.640> two<00:02:45.030> devices<00:02:45.390> charges<00:02:46.020> at<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
and we've got two devices charges at the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.600 
and we've got two devices charges at the
same<00:02:46.350> time<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.770> then<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:47.070> play<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.280> third

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
same time and then I can play the third

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.570 
same time and then I can play the third
one<00:02:47.850> in<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.810> third<00:02:49.140> port<00:02:49.500> here<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.550> very

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
one in to this third port here so very

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.260 
one in to this third port here so very
very<00:02:51.300> easy<00:02:51.570> solution<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.890> charging<00:02:53.760> multiple

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
very easy solution for charging multiple

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.670 
very easy solution for charging multiple
devices<00:02:55.370> now<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:57.510> massive<00:02:57.930> plus<00:02:58.200> point<00:02:58.530> of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
devices now the massive plus point of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.530 
devices now the massive plus point of
these<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.190> charge<00:03:00.060> all<00:03:00.270> three

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
these is you can charge all three

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.840 
these is you can charge all three
devices<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.170> only<00:03:01.380> use<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:01.920> power<00:03:02.250> cable<00:03:02.370> so

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
devices and only use one power cable so

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.240 
devices and only use one power cable so
you've<00:03:02.940> only<00:03:03.000> taken<00:03:03.330> up<00:03:03.600> one<00:03:03.840> socket<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.620> your

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
you've only taken up one socket on your

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.930 
you've only taken up one socket on your
minds<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.560> didn't<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:07.980> was<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.700> this

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
minds what I didn't like was that this

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.050 
minds what I didn't like was that this
mini<00:03:09.270> USB<00:03:09.510> socket<00:03:10.320> for<00:03:11.160> my<00:03:11.310> phone<00:03:11.640> here<00:03:11.910> might

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
mini USB socket for my phone here might

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.300 
mini USB socket for my phone here might
not<00:03:12.270> be<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.540> same<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:12.930> every<00:03:13.200> phone<00:03:13.440> actually

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
not be the same for every phone actually

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.700 
not be the same for every phone actually
means<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.610> my<00:03:14.850> phone<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.210> facing<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.530> wrong

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
means that my phone is facing the wrong

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.550 
means that my phone is facing the wrong
way<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.310> can't<00:03:17.730> see<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.660> screen<00:03:18.870> until<00:03:19.200> it

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
way so I can't see the screen until it

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.770 
way so I can't see the screen until it
is<00:03:19.650> charging<00:03:20.070> other<00:03:20.850> than<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.240> course<00:03:21.270> if<00:03:21.660> I

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
is charging other than of course if I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.650 
is charging other than of course if I
turn<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.200> unit<00:03:22.470> round<00:03:23.000> then<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.270> obviously

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
turn the unit round then I can obviously

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.480 
turn the unit round then I can obviously
check<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.620> see<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.160> actually

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
check to see that it is actually

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.670 
check to see that it is actually
charging<00:03:27.210> so<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> would<00:03:28.080> have<00:03:28.200> liked<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.530> have

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
charging so I would have liked to have

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.250 
charging so I would have liked to have
seen<00:03:28.740> maybe<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.640> way<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.330> reversing<00:03:30.750> these

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
seen maybe a way of reversing these

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.930 
seen maybe a way of reversing these
around<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.040> other<00:03:32.190> way<00:03:32.370> but<00:03:32.610> they<00:03:32.730> will

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
around to the other way but they will

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.100 
around to the other way but they will
only<00:03:33.120> fit<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.830> one<00:03:35.010> orientation<00:03:36.110> it's

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
only fit in in the one orientation it's

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.170 
only fit in in the one orientation it's
a<00:03:37.170> small<00:03:37.410> complain<00:03:37.800> but<00:03:38.460> I<00:03:38.520> suppose<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.000> won't

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
a small complain but I suppose it won't

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.360 
a small complain but I suppose it won't
affect<00:03:39.960> every<00:03:40.350> single<00:03:40.380> device<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.280> you

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
affect every single device that you

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.260 
affect every single device that you
charge<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.030> unit<00:03:43.040> what<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.070> did<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.460> was

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
charge with the unit what I did like was

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.410 
charge with the unit what I did like was
the<00:03:45.540> feel<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.710> device<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.670> very<00:03:47.940> well<00:03:48.150> made
