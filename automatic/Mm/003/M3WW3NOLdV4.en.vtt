00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
is your configuration we have like one

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.130 
is your configuration we have like one

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
to where you should put these to mess

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.360 
to where you should put these to mess
around<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:04.230> basically<00:04:04.590> when<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:04.830> play<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> song

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
around but basically when I play a song

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.990 
around but basically when I play a song
the<00:04:05.970> equalizer<00:04:06.450> will<00:04:06.870> display<00:04:07.440> behind<00:04:08.400> here

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
the equalizer will display behind here

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.140 
the equalizer will display behind here
and<00:04:09.350> when<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.500> hits<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:11.040> certain<00:04:11.340> when<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.000> hits

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
and when it hits a certain when it hits

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.870 
and when it hits a certain when it hits
over<00:04:12.510> these<00:04:12.660> bars<00:04:12.930> here<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.549> when

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
over these bars here that is when

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.990 
over these bars here that is when
certain<00:04:15.630> zones<00:04:16.109> will<00:04:16.470> light<00:04:16.680> up<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.250> let<00:04:17.910> me

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
certain zones will light up so let me

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.520 
certain zones will light up so let me
play<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.239> song<00:04:18.510> here

just gonna play something real fast and

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.770 
just gonna play something real fast and
you<00:04:27.919> might<00:04:28.220> hear<00:04:28.370> on<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.780> recorder

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
you might hear on the recorder

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.320 
you might hear on the recorder
feedbacking<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.500> little<00:04:30.740> bit<00:04:31.150> I'm<00:04:32.150> going<00:04:32.270> to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
feedbacking a little bit I'm going to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.170 
feedbacking a little bit I'm going to
bring<00:04:32.540> back<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.900> menu

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.910 

I'm<00:04:39.570> trying<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.050> invent

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.040 

you'll<00:04:43.580> see<00:04:43.790> that<00:04:44.000> these<00:04:44.240> are<00:04:44.300> jumping

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
you'll see that these are jumping

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.370 
you'll see that these are jumping
whenever<00:04:45.710> they<00:04:45.920> hit<00:04:46.490> red<00:04:47.150> it's<00:04:47.930> gonna<00:04:48.110> send<00:04:48.350> a

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
whenever they hit red it's gonna send a

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.900 
whenever they hit red it's gonna send a
signal<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:48.830> this<00:04:49.090> blinks<00:04:50.110> so<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:52.220> also<00:04:52.460> what

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
signal that this blinks so you also what

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.280 
signal that this blinks so you also what
you<00:04:53.000> want<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.210> do<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.510> these<00:04:53.690> won't<00:04:53.870> be<00:04:53.990> here

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
you want to do is these won't be here

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.040 
you want to do is these won't be here
but<00:04:54.320> you're<00:04:54.650> going<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.800> add<00:04:55.990> let's<00:04:56.990> say

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
but you're going to add let's say

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.510 
but you're going to add let's say
speakers<00:04:59.080> under<00:05:00.080> speakers<00:05:00.740> you'll<00:05:01.070> go<00:05:01.280> into

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
speakers under speakers you'll go into

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.670 
speakers under speakers you'll go into
there<00:05:01.850> you'll<00:05:02.090> end<00:05:02.330> it<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.630> these<00:05:03.530> are

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
there you'll end it and these are

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.620 
there you'll end it and these are
frequency<00:05:04.130> bands<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.640> it's<00:05:05.030> similar<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.450> what

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
frequency bands so it's similar to what

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.990 
frequency bands so it's similar to what
you<00:05:05.750> have<00:05:05.900> here<00:05:06.010> one<00:05:07.010> through<00:05:07.250> four<00:05:07.460> five<00:05:07.820> to

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
you have here one through four five to

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.430 
you have here one through four five to
eight<00:05:08.150> nine<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.600> twelve<00:05:08.870> that's<00:05:09.170> what<00:05:09.350> these

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
eight nine to twelve that's what these

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.900 
eight nine to twelve that's what these
frequency<00:05:09.890> bands<00:05:10.100> are<00:05:10.250> what's<00:05:10.490> what<00:05:10.640> this<00:05:10.790> is

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
frequency bands are what's what this is

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.410 
frequency bands are what's what this is
doing<00:05:11.090> is<00:05:11.860> you'll<00:05:12.860> set<00:05:13.250> let's<00:05:14.060> say<00:05:14.240> right

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
doing is you'll set let's say right

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.090 
doing is you'll set let's say right
speaker<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:14.900> less<00:05:15.020> speaker<00:05:15.380> when<00:05:15.710> these

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
speaker and less speaker when these

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.550 
speaker and less speaker when these
bands<00:05:16.760> are<00:05:16.910> hit<00:05:17.390> when<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.810> mid<00:05:17.960> one<00:05:18.170> the<00:05:18.260> music

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
bands are hit when the mid one the music

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.260 
bands are hit when the mid one the music
goes<00:05:18.710> above<00:05:19.040> the<00:05:19.220> level<00:05:19.550> that<00:05:19.640> you<00:05:19.760> selected

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
goes above the level that you selected

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.140 
goes above the level that you selected
it<00:05:20.810> will<00:05:20.870> make<00:05:21.200> these<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.710> blink<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.970> if<00:05:23.060> you

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
it will make these to blink and if you

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.840 
it will make these to blink and if you
can<00:05:23.300> do<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.390> color<00:05:23.720> or<00:05:23.990> random<00:05:24.350> color<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.890> was

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
can do a color or random color I was

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.680 
can do a color or random color I was
going<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.060> close<00:05:26.240> this<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:27.640> I<00:05:28.640> mean<00:05:29.420> you<00:05:29.540> gotta

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
going to close this so I mean you gotta

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.000 
going to close this so I mean you gotta
mess<00:05:29.900> around<00:05:30.050> with<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.440> you'll<00:05:30.620> see<00:05:30.770> how<00:05:30.890> it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
mess around with it you'll see how it

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.850 
mess around with it you'll see how it
works<00:05:31.480> it's<00:05:32.480> kind<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.720> self-explanatory<00:05:33.050> once

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
works it's kind of self-explanatory once

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.920 
works it's kind of self-explanatory once
you<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.610> do<00:05:34.760> bands<00:05:35.090> for<00:05:35.390> each<00:05:35.450> one<00:05:35.690> of<00:05:35.720> these

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
you you do bands for each one of these

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.740 
you you do bands for each one of these
and<00:05:36.290> so<00:05:36.950> let's<00:05:37.160> say<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:38.000> know<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.150> have<00:05:38.300> my<00:05:38.540> logo

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
and so let's say you know I have my logo

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.530 
and so let's say you know I have my logo
blinking<00:05:39.380> at<00:05:39.560> 21<00:05:40.040> and<00:05:40.130> 24<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:40.850> every<00:05:41.090> time<00:05:41.270> that

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
blinking at 21 and 24 so every time that

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.040 
blinking at 21 and 24 so every time that
turns<00:05:41.780> red<00:05:42.220> it's<00:05:43.220> going<00:05:43.760> to<00:05:43.910> blink<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.870> then<00:05:44.990> I

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
turns red it's going to blink and then I

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.950 
turns red it's going to blink and then I
have<00:05:45.170> 25<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.680> 28<00:05:45.950> 29<00:05:46.430> through<00:05:46.610> 32<00:05:46.850> and<00:05:47.510> it<00:05:47.780> is

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
have 25 to 28 29 through 32 and it is

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.440 
have 25 to 28 29 through 32 and it is
really<00:05:48.110> just<00:05:48.350> takes<00:05:48.590> a<00:05:48.850> time<00:05:49.850> to<00:05:50.060> mess<00:05:50.300> around

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
really just takes a time to mess around

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.210 
really just takes a time to mess around
with<00:05:50.720> once<00:05:51.470> you<00:05:51.530> do<00:05:51.680> that<00:05:51.710> you're<00:05:52.040> going<00:05:52.190> to

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
with once you do that you're going to

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.760 
with once you do that you're going to
save<00:05:52.460> your<00:05:52.610> configuration<00:05:53.770> and<00:05:55.210> play<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.240> song

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770
