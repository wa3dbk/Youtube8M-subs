00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello today there is a small one again 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.569
 Experiment some time ago I have 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.370
 an episode made about the source 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 ability of various alternative 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.290
 so maile almonds mandl mail 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.839
 coconut and so on this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.310
 experiment or imagination to age 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.380
 I would like to have alternatives today 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.570
 continue today is about slow 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 ground flax seed here and sahm 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.599
 flea - shells that are together the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 very common in eco bio alternatives 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.040
 area are offered the tremendous 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 health benefits said 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.399
 But they will be the biggest part 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.260
 not scientifically hold 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.670
 to let 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.829
 one of the many benefits of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.350
 but actually be detected 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 let is a possible advantageous 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.820
 effect on the digestive where we come 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.469
 later to all these seeds have in common 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.430
 that you are in contact with water 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 swell up 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.350
 sometimes less fast and also 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.059
 times more less strong 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.719
 binding ability of water is very 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.460
 different 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.899
 and that's exactly what I want today 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 my video demonstrate because the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.299
 differences are there still formidable when 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.610
 you ask yourself what do you need that for 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.720
 especially the flea seed husks for 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.760
 example, do not have a particularly large 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.260
 value thinks really wrote against 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 null why should you eat them then 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.009
 As I said, they swell and have 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.750
 this influences the texture 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.400
 the mouthfeel of an ingredient 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.979
 So, if I'm a sauce , for example 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.390
 want to create and for no strength 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.549
 and no blood wants to use it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.220
 maybe I could do such a thing 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.630
 on flea seed translucent recourse to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.119
 just the desired result 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.650
 achieve and the same applies to the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.110
 other ingredients but we start only 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.119
 times with the experiment I have the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.650
 individual samples her built up about 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.360
 I have the same volume each time 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 not taken the same mass because 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.340
 Of course, finely ground flour is from 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.520
 another denser than that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.869
 whole seeds the huge crowds have 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.159
 I now wrote to that and im 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.020
 further course will be now 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.479
 to add different amounts of water 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.090
 and write that down and then 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.710
 Let's see what happens 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.680
 who saw here and the flaxseed 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.689
 also very often advertised with her 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.640
 omega-3 fatty acid content that's right 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.050
 Also there are omega 3 fatty acids in it 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.330
 however, it is so that they are in the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.090
 alpha linolenic acid 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.210
 present hla something for the people 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.380
 is really valuable is the form 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.880
 eicosapentaenoic acid and dha 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.520
 docosahexaenoic acid dha and that's what you get 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.110
 otherwise found in fish oil and this alpha 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.820
 Linolenic acid is in the body in this 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.620
 but remodeled two other fatty acids 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.870
 only with an efficiency of about 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.210
 five percent of what it looks like you have 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.310
 So not so much of, however, 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.080
 feed animals like birds chickens 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.940
 then you can do that in your products 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.090
 like eggs or meat in this other 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.280
 epia and the h shape would have been there 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.130
 So you get more from that here 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.230
 seeds and flaxseed of people barely 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.850
 to be digested if they are whole seeds 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.040
 be swallowed because we just do not 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.670
 birds are and hardly have any dare 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.630
 that is the next to the direct way 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.220
 out of the human and so you have 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.709
 Not much of that anyway 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.970
 like more valuable in there stuck in the case of 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.580
 Ground flaxseed is natural 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.900
 otherwise it's better off 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.220
 however it may be allowed again 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.260
 get rancid faster 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.820
 The sawdust is really only too 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.220
 compare purposes in it just to 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.380
 see how similar substances namely 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.239
 otherwise cellulose-containing substances 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.459
 Behave the sawdust that is now off 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.140
 for the most part made of pine wood 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.600
 Of course I do not recommend it 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.769
 with sawdust stuffing so and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.820
 what has all this with the 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.470
 to do digestion 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.000
 the products we help to see here 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.290
 against various digestive problems 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.580
 on one side they help against 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.680
 diarrhea just because they are so much 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.360
 take up liquid and thereby for 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.860
 to consolidate the chair 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.250
 on the other side you can also against 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.600
 help constipation because they swell up 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.690
 so lady get bigger and thereby the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.160
 incite bowel emptying reflex 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.390
 But you can also constipation 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.370
 If you do not bring them with you 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.170
 sufficient liquid takes with himself because 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.450
 So you have to be careful and best 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.680
 read the leaflet and what 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.780
 Can I use it otherwise in the kitchen 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.459
 start the culinary benefits 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.989
 exists, among other things, for example 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.120
 that the seeds here are very good as 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.680
 peer groups substitute the use 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.570
 I had a recipe about red 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.070
 Grown already shown how 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.870
 flealy scarf settle in 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.519
 Stir in different parts with and 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.010
 can just go for a better one 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.910
 liability 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.709
 now only the ones are here 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.510
 seeds and the flea-seeded peels in the 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.830
 race the rest I have taken out 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.960
 because their production is quasi 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.120
 have and the sawdust was anyway only too 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.740
 general demonstration purposes 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.930
 that does not matter in the first one 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.750
 meaning the flea-shells are now 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.490
 arrived at 19 but there is still 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.379
 a lot more that lasts longer and 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.969
 especially fine crushed again 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.189
 that is now with a fork make then 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.719
 the surface gets bigger again and it has 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.530
 again a possibility more liquid 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.919
 take 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.789
 The 16 have reached here and that 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.469
 is the relationship that's already 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.840
 more often called a stable 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.280
 to form money 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.110
 how far may that go with the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.629
 flea seed husks meanwhile we are 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.669
 arrived at one to twelve and it works 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.650
 so slowly towards the end 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.669
 We are now going up at the seed here 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.860
 the one to seven 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.449
 it will be a bit thin then 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.009
 the flea seed husks, on the other hand, have 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.080
 still an impressively good one 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.120
 fortification nothing express that again 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.669
 a fork around the surface again 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.419
 to enlarge these lumps 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.860
 mince and I stop now 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.789
 the at the flea seed can be translucent 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.099
 see that although still a bit 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.139
 But more is just the bond so 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.039
 slowly wears off is rather small 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.039
 drop below 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.479
 so that 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.669
 with the information from this video 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.710
 information about water intake 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.409
 ability over the source ability of 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.330
 has won various ingredients 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.759
 nobody has to do the keys yourself 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.800
 Now you know how much water you have 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.819
 pick up flea seed husks and how little 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.960
 to absorb water and ground flaxseed 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.580
 Everyone can decide for themselves 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.800
 what he actually does with that in the end 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.509
 kitchen makes for sauces that can 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.129
 be practical but also for Beck i 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.210
 hope it was interesting has fun 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.190
 made to watch 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.550
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.550
 next time
