00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.170
 welcome everyone today i want to tell 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.889
 to you about such interesting knives which me 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.360
 got on review here 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.580
 my good, very good friend 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.800
 tell a friend and he will get a gift 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.619
 girls apparently girl initially 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.170
 heard found talk knives did it 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.720
 he has a gift from such a ring which 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.929
 shipped so pretty solid 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.430
 metal box 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.170
 the knife itself is an instruction where it is shown 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.980
 tell options are recorded 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.500
 filling 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.270
 knife which may vary 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.469
 depending on the model 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.500
 Phillips screwdrivers and scissors 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.340
 further pretty decent sizes 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.239
 knife 12 inches handle length two s 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.719
 about half a centimeter thick 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.489
 such a massive plastic itself 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.930
 the handle has such rubberized 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.010
 inserts that are also concave 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.260
 Apparently this all improves the retention of the knife 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.090
 In general, I think that this is very wise. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.540
 the girl made a gift because the knives 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.479
 Victorix wenger seems to me that such 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.000
 on jean especially not small and small 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.079
 very nice nice big ones like that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.909
 more such a gift such a knife which 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.770
 will be happy to push any level this 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.630
 novice person who is keen on 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 starts to get involved in knives or is it already 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.470
 advanced pressure seems to me such 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.619
 the knife will not leave anyone indifferent 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.560
 so the girl seems very wise to me 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.579
 Received to make such a gift 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.750
 but back to our subject means 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.610
 there is the possibility of one-handed 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.360
 opening the blade secure lock 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.159
 what is it called they have that is just 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.659
 so we do not close the blade, I understand that 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.400
 This very many already know but 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.860
 there will definitely be a person who 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.450
 I know so I mentioned it there for 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.590
 order to close the blade we need 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.230
 click on this button 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.480
 the liner there bend that is the liner 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.870
 this knife 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.370
 the liner bends down then we close 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.380
 if we do n't click we won't close 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:29.400
 blade blade length of 9 quite a centimeter 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:35.970
 cutting edge about a centimeter 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:38.690
 less then there is a good 8 centimeters 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.690
 here for. 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.540
 given the fact that they have something to cut 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.680
 products what is this 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.930
 everything is more dense in this respect 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.510
 not bad 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.510
 what else do we have here no further 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.190
 said that there is a small 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.370
 vertical backlash at the blade 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.140
 but it is one-sided what sense is your backlash 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.940
 will feel if you try 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.500
 blade push down push down and eat 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.480
 backlash 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.330
 but if you will pull him up captive 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.530
 who has no backlash or feel what it means 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.400
 it means that if you will something 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.190
 then blade the blade with a knife 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.840
 the blade will try to go up and you 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.870
 absolutely when planing absolutely not 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.780
 feel no play is such a 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.640
 the trick is whether there are 2 breasts there but 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.150
 felt when working he is not at all 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:44.840
 will mean here we still have 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.820
 Of course, where without them 2 bottle openers 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.910
 bottle opener 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.930
 she's a screwdriver she's crimped for wire 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.070
 can opener 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.320
 and very sharp so sharpened very 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.510
 decent and to be inaccurate then 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.360
 you can easily cut this 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.810
 a small blade like that 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.569
 what 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.470
 bottle openers have only one position 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.979
 fixed that is like from small 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.350
 quizzes and when opened glasses 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.090
 to the floor my blade is also fixed in 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.540
 two positions like this in this 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.400
 position at 90 degrees there is a fixation 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.550
 intermediate and fixing the same when 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.290
 opener fully opened here 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.550
 fixing is only in this position 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:42.650
 intermediate fixation is not here further 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:46.370
 we have such a saw here I did not measure 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.910
 her long well she is definitely longer than the blade i 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.780
 at home that not less than ten centimeters 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.789
 so very lucky so sharp and here I am 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.830
 2 little things I noticed that in 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.990
 general can be completely unnoticed 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.760
 say if not look closely but on 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.470
 really very well so facilitate 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.570
 not that making it easier does the job 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.389
 Saw more comfortable and say so 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.729
 general appeal spylog first here 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.180
 this loop which on the blade is yes she 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.180
 plays the role of guard for the saw first 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.880
 If you saw something that it protects against 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.710
 unauthorized collision with 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.300
 some material that you will 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.539
 clean secondly from this side she 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.250
 just playing the role of limiter then 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:38.150
 there is simply you did not commit too much 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:42.080
 movement of some kind and in the closed state 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:46.190
 saw a little bit in favor of the handle to 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.520
 we could comfortably pull it out because 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.470
 what should this be done because she 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.840
 all the same very much recessed in the handle 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.720
 even if she was not drowned if 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.139
 there was such a cut under the nail because 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.150
 that the pilate is rather long 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.759
 both are uncomfortable with the nail there pick it up 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.469
 but for this ledge it is very convenient to do it 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.719
 small rather big just doing 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:14.189
 just enough to be comfortable 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:17.340
 pick up and open on this side all 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:26.169
 the opposite side of us all simpler 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:33.879
 corkscrew and sewed off the very tuba I lived with 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:37.590
 holes and also pretty sharp well here 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.590
 perhaps all with this knife 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.750
 the knife is very nice as I have repeatedly 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.360
 spoke and i've seen eyes burn 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.719
 my friend when he holds his hands 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.930
 he already had Chinese knives before 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:55.509
 but it was also prohodnyak islands and such 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.370
 until chinese but that's when he keeps in 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:59.860
 hands this knife I see how it all 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.650
 like how it opens closes 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:06.370
 the blade clicks the knife i imagine to 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:09.639
 with him was if the port in hand turned out 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.979
 military whether flipper some I mean 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.689
 I see that this is a human disease knives 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:15.460
 mans rooted and our 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:19.930
 progress is due to the fact 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.639
 knives and and sure that they will be still on 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.339
 I am only happy for him in this regard 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:28.029
 and generally think that God forbid everyone 

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:30.399
 pushing a girlfriend girlfriend if 

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:34.240
 of course there is no pressure on wife or 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:35.800
 thank you all for your attention big 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.300
 thanks to those who watched to the end 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.300
 and see you soon
