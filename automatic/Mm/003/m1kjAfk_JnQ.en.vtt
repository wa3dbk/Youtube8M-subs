00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.260
 I propose here to explain how 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.000
 goes from the tree trunk to coal then 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.700
 to do that I'm going to start with this 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.710
 diagram here for information you have a 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.270
 arrow of time in geology when one 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.789
 can trace a chronology of 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.760
 events have always made the bottom towards 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.500
 the top then in red I will write 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.230
 their a number of conditions that 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.050
 will allow to transform a trunk 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.489
 of charcoal tree at first 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.040
 as the title says it takes a 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.610
 tree with a trunk of the leaves of 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.910
 roots so here I have you represent a 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.920
 area rich in plants so if I 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.059
 want a lot of plants so a lot 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.760
 organic matter 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.940
 we've seen it in other videos 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.040
 know that plants towards 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.600
 chlorophyllian requires energy 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.730
 solar to achieve photosynthesis 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.309
 so in areas where I will have a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.629
 significant light intensity and 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.369
 a lot of water since you know that for 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.590
 to do the photosynthesis I need between 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.500
 other water and well I'll have a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.149
 lush vegetation so first 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.729
 condition a lot of an abundance of 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:20.539
 plants that is related to a sun 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.700
 so rather cheap equatorial forest a 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.700
 area with strong light intensity 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.099
 a lot of plants then I need 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.440
 water then cast represent the water 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.759
 here why the problem is that my 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.950
 organic matter it is very fast 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.770
 degraded by decomposers if I in 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.390
 fruits quickly under water with a 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.399
 set of sediments I'm going to be able 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.030
 avoid decomposition 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:48.280
 So you need plants I need to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.280
 water and a quick burial 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.270
 how does this burial the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.299
 organic matter quickly for this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.880
 do we will have for example by the 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.799
 bias of then it's not in the program 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.679
 we will have an increase in the level 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.019
 marine it can be more of an explanation 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.680
 which explains this increase in 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.900
 sea ​​level 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.819
 but this water that goes back I wrote to you 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.610
 here bathymetry strong it means a 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.790
 large volume of water will allow to 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.829
 run away quickly but plant 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.959
 chlorophyllian so fast burial 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.640
 thanks to the water you see that I have left 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.739
 more than one seen a tree trunk here the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.780
 remains has been buried I need to 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.420
 bury this material as a relief 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.459
 positive not very far to what serves me 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.349
 this mountain well my mountain 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.569
 when it is eroded it brings me a 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.489
 number of sediments of 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.010
 grain size more or less 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.170
 strong then you're big grain if I have 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.670
 torrential rains and so I'm going 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.440
 take off two big pieces of my 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.470
 mountain and the idea is to offer 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.090
 quickly my piece my tree trunk 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.280
 under relatively rocky pieces 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.799
 and fishing with a g naked but a 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.120
 pardon particle size strong so the 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.970
 small or that I have you 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.440
 mini shrink in orange it would be types 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.799
 rocks are called conglomerates 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.000
 there on the photograph that you see here 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.220
 there is a hip she lies we see a 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.959
 strong granulometry of coarse grains is 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.230
 underneath you do not distinguish with the eye 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.090
 bare 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.120
 it's actually grains a lot 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.290
 smaller the intensity of the water that has 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.739
 brought these debris of relief to vary and 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.409
 allowed this rapid burial relief 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.599
 plant water fast burial and 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.060
 then it will take me to train the 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.030
 fossilization process a 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.739
 temperature increase 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.650
 and then I'll have to 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.090
 time in the case of fossilization 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.519
 the temperature increase it is 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.049
 joint with processes also of 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.569
 bacteria the bacterial process even 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.579
 even mushrooms that participate in 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.459
 fossilization of organic matter 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.139
 in mineral matter so the trunk 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.510
 of charcoal tree I obviously needed 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.250
 trees but I also needed to 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.200
 water I needed events 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.620
 tectonics favoring a landfill 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 fast and so a positive relief here a 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.349
 mountain not far away for information 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.630
 here I've traced the chain the 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:29.440
 geological time scale forgiveness 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.960
 and you may have heard of the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.660
 Carboniferous Carboniferous it comes from 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 carbon gold coal and well that's 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.330
 carbon so I put you small 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.060
 stars in red these are the areas where we 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.039
 at ages forgiveness we have great 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.610
 hydrocarbon coal formations and 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.150
 oil 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.789
 and you notice that these ages of strong 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.850
 training production forgiveness 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:58.950
 hydrocarbons are related to 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.320
 doro genesis zones of formation of 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.600
 important relief for example at the level 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.080
 Silurian could be associated with the 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.180
 aloro youth she Caledonian for 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.830
 the permian aloro genesis Hercynian you 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.870
 do not have to know that I just want to 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.280
 show that to make coal the 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.050
 oil I still need a 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.580
 special tectonic context 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.139
 in other words, the formation of chains 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.300
 of mountains to escape 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.220
 quickly my organic matter and a 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.200
 last thing to do matter 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.020
 organic I need plants and 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.669
 so you can notice here I put you 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.389
 just two dates that can be 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.000
 interesting 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.240
 the higher plants are found at 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.580
 about as much nothing between him 400 - the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.740
 first - 435 months 410 million 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.650
 of years it is therefore illusory to 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.169
 find coal before that date and 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.729
 the expansion of large and throw at 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.090
 type angiosperms those who have 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.950
 flowers 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.320
 it is dated rather this period 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.970
 there the end of the Cretaceous 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.120
 so that's where I'm going to have 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.250
 high production of plants and 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.050
 possibly have you at the little star at 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.850
 Miocene level manufacture 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.560
 hydrocarbons so to make 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.120
 hydrocarbons it takes plants but 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.120
 you also need tecktonik
