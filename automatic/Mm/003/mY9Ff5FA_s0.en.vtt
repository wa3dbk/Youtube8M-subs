people<00:01:05.939> today<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.210> looking<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
people today are looking to see if you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.340 
people today are looking to see if you
need<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> moat<00:01:08.250> s<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.299> meet<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.810> ATSB<00:01:10.770> mandate

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
need a moat s to meet the ATSB mandate

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
need a moat s to meet the ATSB mandate
the<00:01:13.350> fact<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.130> only<00:01:14.280> need<00:01:14.640> Mode<00:01:14.909> S<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the fact is you only need Mode S if you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.310 
the fact is you only need Mode S if you
fly<00:01:15.689> above<00:01:15.990> 18,000<00:01:16.890> feet<00:01:17.090> if<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.240> fly<00:01:18.900> below

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fly above 18,000 feet if you fly below

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
fly above 18,000 feet if you fly below
18,000<00:01:20.310> feet<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> key

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
18,000 feet you can use it you a key

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.550 
18,000 feet you can use it you a key
option<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.360> option<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.990> also<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
option with that option you also need a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.310 
option with that option you also need a
transponder<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> mode<00:01:28.049> C

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
transponder but it can be a mode C

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.550 
transponder but it can be a mode C
transponder<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.210> very<00:01:30.450> cost<00:01:30.900> effective

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
transponder so it's very cost effective

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.490 
transponder so it's very cost effective
in<00:01:31.710> using<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> low<00:01:32.340> cost<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.939> tea<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.020> dsb

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
in using a low cost you a tea for a dsb

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.130 
in using a low cost you a tea for a dsb
and<00:01:35.189> mode<00:01:35.700> C<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and mode C for the

and mode C for the
transponder<00:01:38.040> option<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> market

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
transponder option so we see the market

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.850
