00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.390
 Is everything good with you? 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 This is my nail tip for today. 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.790
 the beginning of the cup and I'll bring two 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.610
 suggestions in a single video starts 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.160
 applying my strengthening base in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.740
 followed by two layers of the ocean of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.470
 pearls on the lines where I will not do 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.140
 the drawing on the middle nail I'll do 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.900
 this gradient diagonally with green 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 emerald of risquÃ© the ocean of super 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.469
 pearl the real yellow of the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.629
 scratch an easy nibble in the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 white base and arrived at this result 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.079
 I'll make the flag of the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.700
 Brazil in the other bad 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.239
 I apply two ribbons forming a v 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.910
 this way in the middle of the nail and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.340
 I applied on the back or the base of the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.460
 nail the emerald green the way 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:07.439
 I made showing the application of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:11.240
 enamel and remove the ribbons and I'll do 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.240
 the yellow part of our flag 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.020
 I'll wear the same real yellow 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.330
 I'll apply it very carefully 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.060
 in this part that was without enamel 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.390
 I applied two trowels applied a 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 I hope to take a break and apply the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 little ball 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 I'm making half the flag I 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.579
 I will use this ocean glaze again one 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.170
 toothpick and I'm going to do half the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:47.570
 ball in the corner of the nail take with a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.420
 and from there I'll draw 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.430
 the curve of the ball 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 there is no secret and then I go 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.540
 filling every circus and then I go 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.030
 making the final hurdles with the stone 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.719
 white I make a flag laugh 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.020
 is the white thorn of the center of the flag 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:13.390
 and this is one of my suggestions you 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.460
 can use only with a gradient and the flag 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.340
 but if you want to do this other 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.280
 We will expect to dry the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.120
 gradient both passing a finger to you 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.090
 see 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.610
 and there the duty to take in a sense 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.520
 I will apply the ribbons in the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.010
 opposite way 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.930
 so if the gradient is to one side I'll go 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.860
 apply the ribbons for the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.980
 other side 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.280
 another detail how much more ribbons you 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.739
 applying one parallel to the other is more 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.230
 I'm pretty result in my opinion ok 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.920
 Good, I'm applying several ribbons. 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.440
 one parallel to the other also with 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.500
 at a certain angle, no tarrÃ© had also 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.230
 angled and one side of the other 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.959
 There were several small ribbons I'm applying 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.660
 the last and now I come back with the foot screen 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.000
 white color and passes a layer 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.340
 same thick medium optics 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.820
 preferably does not use too much enamel 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.280
 thick but it worked 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.250
 applied is white enamel to people already 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 has been removing the ribbons and there 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:30.810
 getting the result of our fingernails 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.810
 cup or withdrawing a 1 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.580
 and the result was very different than 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.180
 I think it's cool, baby. 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.490
 I hope you like to cast off and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.710
 to finish this nail I apply a 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.260
 layer of my extrabrush I'm using the 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.030
 mirror should remain and that is the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.160
 final result 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.770
 I really hope you liked the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.800
 photos will be there on the face follow me on 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 instagram is a super kiss a great 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.950
