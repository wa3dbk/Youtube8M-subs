we<00:02:12.600> believe<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.310> about<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> 300<00:02:15.000> million

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
we believe it to be about a 300 million

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.480 
we believe it to be about a 300 million
year<00:02:15.630> old<00:02:16.700> front<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.790> sea<00:02:18.060> dinosaur<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.490> that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
year old front of sea dinosaur that that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.180 
year old front of sea dinosaur that that
has<00:02:20.640> long<00:02:21.060> been<00:02:21.270> thought<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.720> extinct<00:02:22.230> but

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
has long been thought to be extinct but

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.520 
has long been thought to be extinct but
we<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.459> found<00:02:23.640> now<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.260> may<00:02:25.470> be

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
we have found now that that it may be

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.750 
we have found now that that it may be
that<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:26.010> creature<00:02:26.280> does<00:02:26.550> exist<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.209> it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
that this creature does exist and it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.570 
that this creature does exist and it
ongoing<00:02:30.980> investigation<00:02:31.980> should<00:02:32.220> prove<00:02:32.459> it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
ongoing investigation should prove it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.729 
ongoing investigation should prove it
but<00:02:32.970> things<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.420> can't<00:02:33.750> would<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.260> mention

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
but things we can't would really mention

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.670 
but things we can't would really mention
it<00:02:34.890> because<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.690> haven't<00:02:36.690> personally<00:02:37.050> seen
