00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 we are here and we have to go there 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.590
 it's a four years it's you 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.060
 it's a degree 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.210
 in cup 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.210
 790 yen 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.980
 Oh 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.089
 so now we're going on a value that 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.789
 is called a deister so it's a 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.190
 multi city so that means that for 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.859
 find the final box that hidden 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.170
 somewhere we will have to do 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.579
 many stages 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.530
 a bit like a bit of a game of 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.000
 track a little bit for his daughter things and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.129
 we will have to find clues that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.729
 can be either small boxes that 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.100
 are hidden in various places or so 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.839
 signposts with 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.300
 test inscriptions things like 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.490
 that explanatory panels and from there 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.380
 we will have to find some 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.539
 answer some questions that are going 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:19.479
 allow us to find the 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:20.590
 coordinates of the final so here is 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.250
 we are asked to go to point number 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.140
 one that is pretty coordinated 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.140
 here we can see that we are still at 11 m 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 so we have to go to the zero point 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 who may be in the chapel 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.080
 the audition to tell the name of pie ix 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.080
 and external and not internal folds 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:39.760
 so that's 8 and 1 so here we are at 273 m 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.620
 the next and worthy of methods 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.020
 final in the final stage 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.090
 yeah and then you who do it often 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.740
 must geocaching what are you 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.100
 have thought of this little climb here 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.130
 it's physical, it's still going to be 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.080
 rocket it's finally it's interesting 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.810
 because this little horse at 100 the 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.400
 geocaching we would not actually have 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.660
 kiosk here we see it since we 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.170
 elaborate below we see it when we 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.569
 is in the red but 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.120
 we wonder in my level here 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.830
 now here here is gold at the level of 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.950
 the riddle was how had happened 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.239
 simple so these chapel embarrass it 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.220
 had to find dates they have 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.890
 inscribed on the wall and here it was necessary 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.180
 just count the posts the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.480
 pillars that support the roof is the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.120
 central pillar and from there we calculate the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.989
 coordinates of the final the year one continues 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.989
 to go up yeah 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.099
 not 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.520
 if I'm five meters so and so we 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:04.500
 really want to know we do not know what 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:04.500
 do we do not know yes it's a 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.550
 regularity 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.950
 there we can see something that we 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.090
 makes believe that the box could be 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.010
 hidden under the stones and the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:23.500
 cradle of wood we will check them 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:27.910
 we already see the box 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.540
 this is my geocaching box 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.660
 so that's what we found a lot 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.830
 at the very beginning so there is at the beginning of 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.220
 geocaching now it's really 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.220
 small boxes 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.210
 so there we see everything they are 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.970
 when did they go into 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.860
 general at the mail the nickname the date there 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.880
 at times who writes sometimes write 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.550
 things that they want to say 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.270
 that we will register there as we are in 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.669
 team 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.669
 I will often put his nickname too 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.040
 and then you are ftc who is well known 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.040
 it's 5 cash strength
