00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.900
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.570
 Brian in this video clip will tell where 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.179
 you can get the last 3 triple 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.150
 Mammoth is a big ice mammoth 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.609
 According omate we have different color he 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.279
 it became even lighter well as i said 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.090
 he is also 3 local that is for 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.340
 three players 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.830
 This mamok we can transport 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.199
 only players he does not transport vendors 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 he has no merchants 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.670
 get hold of it 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.950
 it is required to execute about three chains 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.440
 quests in the description I brought them 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.219
 links that is exactly what quests you 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.950
 need to perform 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.190
 and where do they come about with regards to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.680
 quests I confess namuchilsya a little 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.329
 because it turns out you need one 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.250
 chain quest run then 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.980
 it turns out another one more room 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 so the place needs to be done in general breaking 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.059
 what is called if you want to do something 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.280
 of course you can but have a little bit 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.619
 torment that is, you need to do these 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 quests and also requires exaltation 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.420
 on the part of the faction their son is lake only 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.570
 after that you will have a vendor 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.090
 which will be in the area under 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 the name doom nefilim in this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.159
 place you can purchase this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.009
 Mammoth long thought I should take off 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.590
 videos or not sure how 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.549
 these quests are done where they come from and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 I came nevertheless to the conclusion that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.040
 probably you should ask dear 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 viewers 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 Do you need these videos or not ? 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.210
 will they be useful to you or do you think 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.329
 that it is absolutely a waste 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.310
 time and it costs me to shoot because 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.470
 that rex as i said already if desired 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.720
 of course you can figure it out yourself 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.329
 but for this you need to attach of course 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.790
 some effort and since i said 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.159
 it is up to you ie leave 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.280
 your comments leave your feedback 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.200
 and in general, everything turns out your hands 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.869
 and on this this video came up 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.430
