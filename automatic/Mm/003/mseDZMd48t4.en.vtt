2<00:00:05.209> which<00:00:06.019> deals<00:00:06.410> with<00:00:06.649> the<00:00:06.830> three<00:00:07.220> major

00:00:07.449 --> 00:00:07.459 
2 which deals with the three major

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.150 
2 which deals with the three major
properties<00:00:08.120> of<00:00:08.330> color<00:00:08.599> which<00:00:08.930> are<00:00:09.160> human

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
properties of color which are human

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.940 
properties of color which are human
saturation<00:00:10.970> you're<00:00:11.870> going<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.200> create<00:00:12.410> three

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
saturation you're going to create three

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.420 
saturation you're going to create three
scales<00:00:13.430> that<00:00:14.300> deal<00:00:15.230> with<00:00:15.560> each<00:00:15.830> one<00:00:16.129> of<00:00:16.189> the

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
scales that deal with each one of the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.460 
scales that deal with each one of the
three<00:00:16.670> properties<00:00:16.940> of<00:00:17.420> color<00:00:17.690> the<00:00:18.230> first

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
three properties of color the first

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.620 
three properties of color the first
scale<00:00:18.830> is<00:00:18.980> a<00:00:19.010> gradation<00:00:19.340> in<00:00:19.730> hue<00:00:20.030> at<00:00:20.180> maximum

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
scale is a gradation in hue at maximum

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.859 
scale is a gradation in hue at maximum
saturation<00:00:21.190> excuse<00:00:22.190> me<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:23.330> first<00:00:23.539> step<00:00:23.720> for

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
saturation excuse me the first step for

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.080 
saturation excuse me the first step for
you<00:00:23.930> to<00:00:23.990> do<00:00:24.170> is<00:00:24.530> to<00:00:24.770> set<00:00:25.010> up<00:00:25.250> your<00:00:25.460> blend<00:00:25.850> we're

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
you to do is to set up your blend we're

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.850 
you to do is to set up your blend we're
going<00:00:26.270> to<00:00:26.390> use<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:26.690> blend<00:00:26.960> tool<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.470> create<00:00:27.740> a

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
going to use the blend tool to create a

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.880 
going to use the blend tool to create a
smooth<00:00:28.190> transition<00:00:28.670> across<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.449> interval<00:00:29.930> so

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
smooth transition across the interval so

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.529 
smooth transition across the interval so
in<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.160> object<00:00:31.580> palette<00:00:31.789> you<00:00:32.000> want<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.300> select

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
in the object palette you want to select

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.889 
in the object palette you want to select
blend<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.320> blend<00:00:33.590> options<00:00:34.690> you'll<00:00:35.690> get<00:00:35.870> a

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
blend and blend options you'll get a

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.690 
blend and blend options you'll get a
dialog<00:00:36.530> box<00:00:36.829> that<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.160> want<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.520> select

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
dialog box that you want to select

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.150 
dialog box that you want to select
specified<00:00:38.570> steps<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.290> indicate<00:00:39.800> the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
specified steps and indicate the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.520 
specified steps and indicate the
intermediary<00:00:40.910> steps<00:00:41.360> in<00:00:41.600> between<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.140> two

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
intermediary steps in between the two

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.310 
intermediary steps in between the two
end<00:00:42.920> positions<00:00:43.880> so<00:00:44.329> we<00:00:44.450> have<00:00:44.570> eight<00:00:44.780> squares

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
end positions so we have eight squares

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.110 
end positions so we have eight squares
that<00:00:45.680> are<00:00:45.800> in<00:00:45.920> between<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.280> two<00:00:46.399> in<00:00:47.000> positions

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
that are in between the two in positions

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.540 
that are in between the two in positions
next<00:00:50.120> thing<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.329> want<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.570> do<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:51.370> determine<00:00:52.370> a

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
next thing you want to do is determine a

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.330 
next thing you want to do is determine a
color<00:00:52.760> for<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.180> first<00:00:53.510> square<00:00:54.340> its

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
color for this first square its

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.639 
color for this first square its
gradation<00:00:56.000> in<00:00:56.120> hue<00:00:56.360> at<00:00:56.480> maximum<00:00:56.989> saturation

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
gradation in hue at maximum saturation

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.680 
gradation in hue at maximum saturation
so<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:57.890> want<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.280> choose<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.579> very<00:00:59.149> bright

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
so you want to choose a very bright

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.600 
so you want to choose a very bright
color<00:00:59.989> saturation<00:01:00.770> relates<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.489> the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
color saturation relates to the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.279 
color saturation relates to the
intensity<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.420> color<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:02.989> fully

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
intensity of a color so a fully

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.500 
intensity of a color so a fully
saturated<00:01:03.649> color<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.309> maximum<00:01:04.909> saturated

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
saturated color a maximum saturated

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.170 
saturated color a maximum saturated
color<00:01:05.690> is<00:01:05.900> very<00:01:06.380> bright<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.880> I'm<00:01:07.970> going<00:01:08.150> to

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
color is very bright so I'm going to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.950 
color is very bright so I'm going to
select<00:01:08.420> red<00:01:10.060> then<00:01:11.060> all<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.299> had<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.420> do<00:01:11.659> is

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
select red then all you had to do is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.200 
select red then all you had to do is
using<00:01:12.260> your<00:01:12.500> selection<00:01:12.950> tool<00:01:13.159> drag<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:13.880> drop

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
using your selection tool drag and drop

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.870 
using your selection tool drag and drop
to<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.110> first<00:01:15.350> position<00:01:15.860> I'd<00:01:16.369> like<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.700> use

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
to the first position I'd like to use

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.179 
to the first position I'd like to use
red<00:01:17.240> for<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.689> beginning<00:01:18.020> position<00:01:18.260> of<00:01:18.740> all<00:01:18.979> of

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
red for the beginning position of all of

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.940 
red for the beginning position of all of
my<00:01:19.369> scales<00:01:20.170> so<00:01:21.170> I'm<00:01:21.229> going<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:21.470> drag<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:21.890> drop

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
my scales so I'm going to drag and drop

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.760 
my scales so I'm going to drag and drop
to<00:01:22.490> those<00:01:22.670> areas<00:01:22.909> as<00:01:23.240> well<00:01:23.450> now<00:01:24.110> gradation<00:01:24.650> in

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
to those areas as well now gradation in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.190 
to those areas as well now gradation in
hue<00:01:25.010> at<00:01:25.130> maximum<00:01:25.640> saturation<00:01:26.270> means<00:01:26.479> that<00:01:26.930> the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
hue at maximum saturation means that the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.140 
hue at maximum saturation means that the
beginning<00:01:27.619> position<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.460> end<00:01:28.640> position

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
beginning position and the end position

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.390 
beginning position and the end position
via<00:01:29.390> should<00:01:29.869> be<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.049> highly<00:01:30.530> saturated<00:01:30.740> color

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
via should be a highly saturated color

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.820 
via should be a highly saturated color
so<00:01:32.060> I'm<00:01:32.119> going<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.420> select<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.960> color<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:33.500> my<00:01:33.619> in

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
so I'm going to select a color for my in

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.469 
so I'm going to select a color for my in
position<00:01:34.430> I'm<00:01:34.640> going<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:34.850> select<00:01:34.939> this<00:01:35.210> blue

for you you can see that when it creates
these<00:01:59.720> steps<00:02:00.110> there<00:02:00.439> they<00:02:00.979> transition<00:02:01.790> evenly

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
these steps there they transition evenly

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.819 
these steps there they transition evenly
meaning<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.750> there's<00:02:02.930> not<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.110> large<00:02:03.439> jump

going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.330> get<00:03:17.510> my<00:03:17.959> default<00:03:18.680> RGB<00:03:19.239> library

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
going to get my default RGB library

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.140 
going to get my default RGB library
which<00:03:21.079> gives<00:03:21.320> me<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> range<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.400> Gray's<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:22.790> I

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
which gives me a range of Gray's and I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.240 
which gives me a range of Gray's and I
want<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.450> select<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.989> grade<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.560> looks<00:03:24.980> like

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
want to select a grade that looks like

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.440 
want to select a grade that looks like
it's<00:03:25.549> not<00:03:25.700> darker<00:03:26.239> or<00:03:26.390> lighter<00:03:26.420> than<00:03:26.989> this<00:03:27.140> red

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
it's not darker or lighter than this red

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.569 
it's not darker or lighter than this red
okay<00:03:29.450> now<00:03:29.720> I'm<00:03:29.840> gonna<00:03:29.959> create<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.560> blend<00:03:33.579> so

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
okay now I'm gonna create the blend so

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.460 
okay now I'm gonna create the blend so
now<00:03:34.790> we<00:03:34.850> have<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> scale<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.049> doesn't<00:03:36.380> look

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
now we have a scale that doesn't look

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.890 
now we have a scale that doesn't look
like<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.829> gets<00:03:37.010> lighter<00:03:37.340> or<00:03:37.760> darker<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.660> looks

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
like it gets lighter or darker it looks

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.380 
like it gets lighter or darker it looks
like<00:03:39.079> it<00:03:39.230> maintains<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:40.069> fixed<00:03:40.370> value<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:41.209> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
like it maintains a fixed value and the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.569 
like it maintains a fixed value and the
hue<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.780> maintained<00:03:42.410> as<00:03:42.560> well<00:03:42.739> as<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.220> red

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
hue is maintained as well as it's red

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.879 
hue is maintained as well as it's red
transitioning<00:03:44.450> all<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.750> way<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:44.930> gray<00:03:45.319> so

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
transitioning all the way to gray so

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.229 
transitioning all the way to gray so
that's<00:03:46.069> how<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.609> would<00:03:46.819> complete<00:03:47.209> your

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
that's how you can would complete your

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.200 
that's how you can would complete your
first<00:03:47.540> assignment
