you<00:01:44.470> can<00:01:44.649> have<00:01:44.679> saddlebags<00:01:45.340> oh<00:01:45.670> wow<00:01:46.509> I<00:01:46.750> think

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
you can have saddlebags oh wow I think

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.529 
you can have saddlebags oh wow I think
I'll<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:47.619> put<00:01:47.890> them<00:01:48.009> on<00:01:48.159> for<00:01:48.340> now<00:01:48.429> just<00:01:49.149> for

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
I'll just put them on for now just for

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.320 
I'll just put them on for now just for
the<00:01:49.840> walls<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.259> guess<00:01:51.119> transmission<00:01:52.119> will

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
the walls I guess transmission will

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.550 
the walls I guess transmission will
fully<00:01:52.750> do<00:01:53.049> that<00:01:53.580> turbo<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:55.349> wheels<00:01:56.349> so<00:01:56.530> that

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
fully do that turbo and wheels so that

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.520 
fully do that turbo and wheels so that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
the handling is like too good just

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.670 
the handling is like too good just
because<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.730> way<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.290> just<00:03:00.290> cause<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
because of the way and just cause of the
