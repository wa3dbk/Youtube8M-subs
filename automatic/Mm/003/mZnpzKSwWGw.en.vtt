 Although there are two people there 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.559
 playing very badly on pc then one world 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.280
 Those people are playing our keyboard. 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.520
 have to improve the squirrels here yet 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:49.110

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.989

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.670

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.030
 After me, bye, bye, I passed the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 I did the trick 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.750
 who could not enter kaka and was not 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.939
 very honest is not worth by key 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.939
 This one was not on this today, but it was not 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.939
 though 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:41.229
 the fact is that oo a bora folks a backflip 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:45.130
 here our narrow is not difficult 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:49.000
 right guys because no controls here in 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.950
 The keyboard thinks it 's much easier 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.440
 who has a face like a crazy in the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.820
 control in black on on by seeing nothing 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:03.729
 for me both the checkpoint is not there 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.530
 some people do not goin 'with me brinks right time 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:11.399
 that this thing here also did not buy the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.399
 right space to get busy and such 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.420
 beach brake good there was now soft ours 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.900
 The first must be very in front of the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.010
 but the environment of the superman and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.150
 Look how nice, people, this is cool. 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.709
 Especially we change the camera and stay 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.000
 mouth with her send the bread 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.810
 Let's make our certain goes to the field. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.650
 in the soul 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:58.270
 the old rascal 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:00.310
 straight he walked but it's kind of bland and 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:07.480
 You risk losing face friend. 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:10.000
 if you commit suicide, luca, our beauty 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.920
 people think this was one of the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.200
 first races created here for 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.000
 to offer something very simple is to 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.170
 over time you will see that it is 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.600
 Old Corintian and I'm thinking, guys. 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.340
 Is it worth buying a control? 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.959
 or buy an adapter that provides for 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.450
 to use xbox and pc control 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.030
 I think it's worth but just to play. 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.410
 race because it kills my son kills 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.130
 The first person we know is very 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.500
 good for the old bush but I'm 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.570
 thinking well that I think the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.480
 Even business people are getting used to 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.580
 play on the keyboard of that other footprint 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.690
 delegate who imagines playing a 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:00.130
 Race gta looks that max was miro bahia 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.170
 gt akman shooting and for us it's very 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.600
 Crazy 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.400
 so I'm in favor now that I thought 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:14.130
 a little better to play on the keyboard mouse 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.130
 Whenever that hand 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.820
 speak put guys here that noise 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.870

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.870

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:38.580
 finally I'll keep on running and the weather 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:39.810
 afif made noise people are there but that's it 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.900
 life here 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.770
 guys like 60fps makes a difference 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 clean race is much smoother old 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:55.650
 for me in the very crazy care this 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.560
 right here right now that you need 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.139
 more speed ww website get out of here 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.700
 I was always around here 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:10.300
 now 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.300
 the racecourse can mon that 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.720
 the car does not get much speed 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.250
 beauty has one more game that we already 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.740
 never without intensity that we have 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:34.539
 that stopping under now was a little bit 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:38.620
 besides, I needed to see this curve in the 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:42.729
 my pocket with calm those curves in 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.460
 years of life, beauty, I think it's going to have 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.500
 more ramps in law and in these campaigns 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.080
 so soft is dough 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:58.270
 I enjoy beauty now let's get 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:01.060
 that alliance a resin tree moral 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.560
 I knew to hit anything 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.949
 Either we attack the checkpoint arrives from 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.340
 popular theory but I'm not the guy is 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:15.639
 here in the human approach and ended up in 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:21.630
 up the ramp in our lion has a new 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:21.630
 slice in our crazy folks 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.060
 Good, I think everyone should be 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.830
 waiting for those insane things that will 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.389
 get out there later, huh? 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.849
 not to mention the way people go 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.370
 do for pc and I'll definitely bring 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.599

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.479

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.460
 players are and I 'm staying here 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.560
