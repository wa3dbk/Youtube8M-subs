that<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> came<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.570> we<00:01:21.570> decided<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that when it came down to we decided to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.170 
that when it came down to we decided to
change<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.860> kind<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> clothing<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.729> i<00:01:23.850> wore

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
also increased the size of the band

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.200 
also increased the size of the band
beyond<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> great<00:01:38.850> deal

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
so overall I found it to be really very

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
so overall I found it to be really very
interesting<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:21.450> how<00:03:22.110> big<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.380> factor<00:03:22.620> is

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
interesting and but how big a factor is

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.520 
interesting and but how big a factor is
it<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.130> my<00:03:23.280> life<00:03:23.459> not<00:03:23.670> really<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.209> if<00:03:24.840> somebody

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it in my life not really I if somebody

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.220 
it in my life not really I if somebody
has<00:03:25.709> something<00:03:26.480> legitimate<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.720> honest<00:03:28.050> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
has something legitimate and honest and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.930 
has something legitimate and honest and
critical<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.739> say<00:03:28.890> about<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.520> work<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.820> I'm

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
critical to say about the work that I'm

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.660 
critical to say about the work that I'm
doing<00:03:29.970> absolutely<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.709> I'm<00:03:32.160> fine<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:32.610> that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
doing absolutely that I'm fine with that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.000 
doing absolutely that I'm fine with that
because<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.239> course<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:34.350> most<00:03:34.680> everybody

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
because of course like most everybody

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.610 
because of course like most everybody
drawing<00:03:35.459> breath<00:03:35.640> on<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.030> globe<00:03:36.270> I'm<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:36.810> not

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
drawing breath on this globe I'm I'm not

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.420 
drawing breath on this globe I'm I'm not
infallible<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.650> guess<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.830> answer<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.310> your

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
infallible so I guess the answer to your

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.560 
infallible so I guess the answer to your
question<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.940> found<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.239> very<00:03:42.269> interesting

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
question is I found it very interesting

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.900 
question is I found it very interesting
and<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.019> think<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.560> many<00:03:44.100> many<00:03:44.340> ways<00:03:44.489> very
