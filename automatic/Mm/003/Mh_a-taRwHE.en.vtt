going to make topspin in a human
alliance<00:01:34.740> form<00:01:35.299> but<00:01:36.470> I'm<00:01:37.470> sure<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.979> will

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
alliance form but I'm sure they will

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.410 
alliance form but I'm sure they will
because<00:01:38.579> they're<00:01:38.610> coming<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> two

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
because they're coming out with the two

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.719 
because they're coming out with the two
others<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.320> lead<00:01:40.470> foot<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:41.040> humans<00:01:41.490> will

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
others on the lead foot from humans will

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.420 
others on the lead foot from humans will
be<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> target<00:01:42.180> exclusive<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.860> assume

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
be a target exclusive so on I assume

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.179 
be a target exclusive so on I assume
they'll<00:01:44.670> make<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> topspin<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.740> I'm<00:01:46.740> counting

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
they'll make a topspin and I'm counting

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.800 
they'll make a topspin and I'm counting
on<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.210> want<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.540> three<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on it because I really want all three of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
on it because I really want all three of
them<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.290> different<00:01:49.320> scales<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.159> very

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
them in all different scales so very

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.690 
them in all different scales so very
cool<00:01:50.610> I'm<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.390> first<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.700> get

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
cool I'm the first one that we will get

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370
