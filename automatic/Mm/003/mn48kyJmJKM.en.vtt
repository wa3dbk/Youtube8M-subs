pallet<00:01:35.189> forks<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.560> amount<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> weight

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
pallet forks in the amount of weight

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.289 
pallet forks in the amount of weight
that<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.030> lift<00:01:39.590> most<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.299> bottom

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that they can lift most of the bottom

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.840 
that they can lift most of the bottom
line<00:01:42.649> inexpensive<00:01:43.649> pallet<00:01:44.040> forks<00:01:44.280> come<00:01:44.640> with

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
line inexpensive pallet forks come with

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.109 
line inexpensive pallet forks come with
3,500<00:01:45.750> pound<00:01:46.020> rated<00:01:46.619> forks<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.909> what

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
3,500 pound rated forks that's what

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.020 
3,500 pound rated forks that's what
these<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> recommend<00:01:50.030> there

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
these are that's what I recommend there

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
these are that's what I recommend there
it's<00:01:51.329> way<00:01:51.780> overkill<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.740> any<00:01:52.890> heavier

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's way overkill to put any heavier

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
it's way overkill to put any heavier
Forks<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> front<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.540> compact<00:01:54.899> tractor

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
Forks on a front of a compact tractor

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.600 
Forks on a front of a compact tractor
because<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.770> more<00:01:55.979> than<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> tractor

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
because that's more than the tractor

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.450 
because that's more than the tractor
will<00:01:56.700> pick<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:57.060> anyway<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.950> 3,500<00:01:58.950> pound<00:01:59.130> forks

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
will pick up anyway so 3,500 pound forks

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.969 
will pick up anyway so 3,500 pound forks
are<00:01:59.610> fine<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.060> some<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> smaller<00:02:01.380> tractors

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
are fine on some of the smaller tractors

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.950 
are fine on some of the smaller tractors
you<00:02:02.250> may<00:02:02.430> want<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> look<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.060> lighter<00:02:03.420> Forks

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you may want to look at lighter Forks

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
is taken up with the palette fork so you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.330 
is taken up with the palette fork so you
may<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:16.020> with<00:02:16.050> even<00:02:16.620> lighter<00:02:16.950> set

Forks<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.410> lift<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.250> an<00:02:35.400> over<00:02:35.670> center<00:02:36.000> device

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
Forks you lift up an over center device

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.290 
Forks you lift up an over center device
to<00:02:36.630> release<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.470> stop<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.160> move<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.940> forks

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
to release the stop and move the forks

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.830 
to release the stop and move the forks
in<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.810> out<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.850> other<00:02:42.090> set<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.420> forks

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
in and out on this other set of forks

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.660 
in and out on this other set of forks
I'm<00:02:42.990> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> show<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:43.860> there<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
I'm going to show you here there is a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.880 
I'm going to show you here there is a
twist<00:02:45.150> device<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.960> that's<00:02:46.020> usually<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.710> two

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
twist device and that's usually the two

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.430 
twist device and that's usually the two
I<00:02:46.920> see<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.910> either<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.570> over<00:02:48.840> Center<00:02:49.140> device

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
I see are either the over Center device

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.070 
I see are either the over Center device
and<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:49.920> lifts<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.460> twist<00:02:50.850> device<00:02:51.300> to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and this lifts up twist device to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.840 
and this lifts up twist device to
release<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.650> forks<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.160> they<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.460> move<00:02:53.610> in

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
release the forks so they can move in

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.950 
release the forks so they can move in
and<00:02:54.030> out<00:02:54.170> either<00:02:55.170> system<00:02:55.680> works<00:02:55.920> fine<00:02:56.720> now<00:02:57.720> one

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
and out either system works fine now one

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.360 
and out either system works fine now one
thing<00:02:58.140> I'm<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.500> tell<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.070> all

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
thing I'm going to tell you on all

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.180 
thing I'm going to tell you on all
pallet<00:02:59.850> forks<00:03:00.120> after<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.750> buy<00:03:01.020> them<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.380> good

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
pallet forks after you buy them a good

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.220 
pallet forks after you buy them a good
coating<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.760> grease<00:03:03.060> up<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.570> down<00:03:03.690> this<00:03:03.930> rail

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
coating of grease up and down this rail

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.110 
coating of grease up and down this rail
that<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.650> travel<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:05.400> make<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> move<00:03:05.910> in

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
that they travel on will make a move in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.600 
that they travel on will make a move in
and<00:03:06.480> out<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.630> lot<00:03:06.930> better<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.530> whole<00:03:08.160> lot<00:03:08.400> better

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
and out a lot better a whole lot better

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.050 
and out a lot better a whole lot better
so<00:03:08.940> keep<00:03:09.180> them<00:03:09.330> greased<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:11.580> next<00:03:11.820> thing<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
so keep them greased the next thing I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
so keep them greased the next thing I
want<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.300> look<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:13.410> little<00:03:13.650> option<00:03:14.220> and
