00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
we have to find out just by looking at

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
we have to find out just by looking at
the<00:01:44.640> thumbnail<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> video<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.750> be

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the thumbnail what the video will be

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660 
the thumbnail what the video will be
about<00:01:45.899> Robin<00:01:46.259> trying<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.590> read<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:46.799> little

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
about Robin trying to read my little

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.789 
about Robin trying to read my little
complex<00:01:48.090> titles<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> often<00:01:49.140> tend<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> have

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
complex titles that I often tend to have

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.429 
complex titles that I often tend to have
which<00:01:50.040> they're<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.540> relevance<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
which they're very little relevance to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350 
which they're very little relevance to
what<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.680> actually<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> video<00:01:53.549> but

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
what is actually in the video but

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.170 
what is actually in the video but
hopefully<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.189> also<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.670> an<00:01:56.790> increase

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
hopefully we will also see an increase

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.179 
hopefully we will also see an increase

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
don't know how close that is i may

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.490 
don't know how close that is i may
actually<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.239> set<00:03:18.510> up<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.690> twitch<00:03:18.900> TV<00:03:19.110> account

from fish flingers which in total

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.240
