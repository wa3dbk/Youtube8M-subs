00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
using a black rapid they're almost

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520 
using a black rapid they're almost
faultless<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.509> opinion<00:00:12.900> but<00:00:12.960> there<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.259> one

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
faultless in my opinion but there is one

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.560 
faultless in my opinion but there is one
thing<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.280> love<00:00:14.549> about<00:00:14.910> it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.450

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
so since I'm doing more and more video I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.300 
so since I'm doing more and more video I
am<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.420> often<00:00:23.810> changing<00:00:24.350> from<00:00:24.529> using<00:00:24.800> my

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310

with the blackrapid

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.420 
with the blackrapid
is<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:32.629> Bulba<00:00:33.110> see<00:00:33.290> one<00:00:33.470> that<00:00:33.680> doesn't<00:00:34.190> fit

is this Bulba see one that doesn't fit

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.000 
is this Bulba see one that doesn't fit
onto<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:34.970> tripod<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:35.660> you're<00:00:35.840> forever<00:00:36.020> screwing

quick-release plate on putting that onto
your<00:00:41.420> tripod<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:41.930> then<00:00:42.020> switching<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.530> back

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
your tripod and then switching it back

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
again back and forth it gets a little

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.510 
again back and forth it gets a little
bit<00:00:44.930> annoying<00:00:45.230> actually<00:00:45.680> blackrapid<00:00:46.430> have

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
bit annoying actually blackrapid have

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.520 
bit annoying actually blackrapid have
had<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.699> product<00:00:47.059> out<00:00:47.150> for<00:00:47.360> ages<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.110> I've<00:00:48.350> just

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
had a product out for ages and I've just

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.020 
had a product out for ages and I've just
dragged<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:48.980> chain<00:00:49.190> on<00:00:49.310> picking<00:00:49.700> one<00:00:49.850> up

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
dragged the chain on picking one up

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.450 
dragged the chain on picking one up
which<00:00:50.540> overcomes<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.590> it's<00:00:51.950> so<00:00:52.220> simple

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
which overcomes that and it's so simple

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.780 
which overcomes that and it's so simple
to<00:00:52.790> use<00:00:52.820> let<00:00:53.180> me<00:00:53.270> show<00:00:53.450> you<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.920> it's<00:00:55.130> just<00:00:55.520> a

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
to use let me show you so it's just a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.690 
to use let me show you so it's just a
special<00:00:56.090> swivel<00:00:56.750> strap<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.920> loop<00:00:58.160> folds

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
special swivel strap that the loop folds

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.880 
special swivel strap that the loop folds
down<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.180> it'll<00:00:59.510> fit<00:00:59.750> within<00:00:59.930> a<00:01:00.110> compatible

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
down and it'll fit within a compatible

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.250 
down and it'll fit within a compatible
tripod<00:01:01.489> quick-release<00:01:01.969> plate<00:01:02.149> here<00:01:03.140> I'm

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
tripod quick-release plate here I'm

downside<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.640> my<00:01:28.760> opinion<00:01:28.790> other<00:01:29.420> than

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
downside to it in my opinion other than

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.330 
downside to it in my opinion other than
not<00:01:30.049> every<00:01:30.320> tripod<00:01:30.710> manufacturer<00:01:31.280> is

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
not every tripod manufacturer is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.310 
not every tripod manufacturer is
supporting<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:31.909> yet<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.240> hope<00:01:32.450> they<00:01:32.659> do<00:01:32.720> because

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
supporting it yet I hope they do because

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.080 
supporting it yet I hope they do because
it's<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:34.100> know<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.820> slightly

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
it's you know it's just a slightly

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.120 
it's you know it's just a slightly
different<00:01:35.240> shape<00:01:36.140> hole<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.439> have<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.860> put<00:01:37.040> in

different shape hole I have to put in
the<00:01:37.220> bottom<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.670> tripod<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:39.049> it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the bottom of the tripod and that it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.960 
the bottom of the tripod and that it
doesn't<00:01:39.470> come<00:01:39.770> standard<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:40.700> something

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
doesn't come standard it's something
