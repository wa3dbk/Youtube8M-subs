00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
using like a GPS solution you know the

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.970 
using like a GPS solution you know the
growth<00:03:30.540> protect<00:03:30.989> solution<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.500> your<00:03:31.620> hair<00:03:31.799> to

think<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.069> did<00:03:59.250> an<00:03:59.340> 8<00:03:59.549> ok<00:04:00.389> job<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:02.010> this

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
think I did an 8 ok job so I like this

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.330 
think I did an 8 ok job so I like this
step<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:03.019> again<00:04:04.639> more<00:04:05.639> gel<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.680> now<00:04:07.680> we're

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
step and again more gel so now we're

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.800 
step and again more gel so now we're
just<00:04:08.459> going<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.730> add<00:04:08.849> more<00:04:09.209> gel<00:04:09.480> because<00:04:09.690> it's

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
just going to add more gel because it's

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.860 
just going to add more gel because it's
going<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.079> help<00:04:10.319> keep<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.730> strips<00:04:12.150> onto<00:04:12.720> your

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
going to help keep the strips onto your

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.650 
going to help keep the strips onto your
head<00:04:13.139> so<00:04:13.440> this<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.799> lot<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.250> gel<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.269> guys<00:04:15.480> so

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
head so this is a lot of gel you guys so

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.539 
head so this is a lot of gel you guys so
if<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.840> don't<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.139> gel<00:04:16.590> then<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.160> might<00:04:17.340> not

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
if you don't like gel then you might not

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.599 
if you don't like gel then you might not
want<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.849> do<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.959> found<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.130> this

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
want to do this but I found that this

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.760 
want to do this but I found that this
technique<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.269> way<00:04:21.539> better<00:04:21.810> than<00:04:22.079> using<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
technique is way better than using the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.680 
technique is way better than using the
growth<00:04:22.979> protect<00:04:23.490> solution<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.060> actually<00:04:24.270> use

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
growth protect solution I actually use

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.810 
growth protect solution I actually use
that<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:25.050> long<00:04:25.470> time<00:04:25.710> ago<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.220> did<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.520> like

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
that a long time ago and I did not like

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.300 
that a long time ago and I did not like
the<00:04:27.000> ending<00:04:27.300> result<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:28.349> I<00:04:28.380> like<00:04:28.800> these<00:04:29.010> wrap

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
the ending result so I like these wrap

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.480 
the ending result so I like these wrap
strips<00:04:29.700> add<00:04:30.330> more<00:04:31.020> gel<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:31.650> then<00:04:31.950> after<00:04:32.400> you

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
strips add more gel and then after you

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.550 
strips add more gel and then after you
do<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:32.910> we're<00:04:33.180> going<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.419> add<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.930> stocking

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
do that we're going to add the stocking

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.640 
do that we're going to add the stocking
cap<00:04:34.770> on<00:04:35.010> top<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.580> after<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.870> stocking<00:04:37.440> cap

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
cap on top and after the stocking cap

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.719 
cap on top and after the stocking cap
let<00:04:38.190> me<00:04:38.310> say<00:04:38.520> this<00:04:38.699> before<00:04:38.970> we<00:04:39.570> go<00:04:40.169> any<00:04:40.410> further

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
let me say this before we go any further

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.300 
let me say this before we go any further
be<00:04:41.729> sure<00:04:42.090> when<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.080> add<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.530> stocking<00:04:43.919> cap<00:04:44.130> to

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
be sure when you add the stocking cap to

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.980 
be sure when you add the stocking cap to
leave<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.789> little<00:04:45.270> bit<00:04:45.450> of<00:04:45.770> your<00:04:47.060> hair<00:04:48.060> out<00:04:48.090> so

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
leave a little bit of your hair out so

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.990 
leave a little bit of your hair out so
do<00:04:49.289> not<00:04:49.500> put<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.890> cap<00:04:50.130> directly

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
do not put the cap directly

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.500 
do not put the cap directly
on<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.900> scalp<00:04:52.320> area<00:04:52.640> push<00:04:53.640> it<00:04:53.820> back<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.030> little

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
on the scalp area push it back a little

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.310 
on the scalp area push it back a little
bit<00:04:54.630> more<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:56.460> can<00:04:56.640> have<00:04:56.850> something

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
bit more so that you can have something

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.750 
bit more so that you can have something
to<00:04:58.320> adhere<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:59.040> can<00:04:59.190> have<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.430> tracks

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
to adhere to you can have the tracks

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.420 
to adhere to you can have the tracks
adhere<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:01.080> cap<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.590> your<00:05:01.890> actual<00:05:02.280> hair

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
adhere to the cap and your actual hair

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.550 
adhere to the cap and your actual hair
so<00:05:02.730> it<00:05:02.880> will<00:05:03.060> stick<00:05:03.390> so<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.050> can<00:05:04.200> see<00:05:04.410> I'm

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
so it will stick so you can see I'm

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.080 
so it will stick so you can see I'm
pushing<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.100> back<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> little<00:05:05.400> bit<00:05:05.700> because<00:05:05.880> you

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
pushing it back a little bit because you

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.150 
pushing it back a little bit because you
want<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.450> make<00:05:06.600> sure<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.830> have<00:05:07.980> that

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
want to make sure that you have that

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.270
