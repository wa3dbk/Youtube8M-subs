supplied to this polymer process if we

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.870 
supplied to this polymer process if we
convert<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.459> into<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:05.509> NGO<00:02:05.929> pellet<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.729> is

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
convert it into to NGO pellet so this is

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.140 
convert it into to NGO pellet so this is
