was born my mother worked at the barn a
complete<00:00:15.130> day<00:00:15.370> and<00:00:15.400> I<00:00:16.270> was<00:00:16.450> born<00:00:16.689> during<00:00:16.960> the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
complete day and I was born during the

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.220 
complete day and I was born during the
night<00:00:17.380> and<00:00:18.189> over<00:00:19.000> the<00:00:19.090> years<00:00:19.360> it's<00:00:19.689> been<00:00:19.869> many

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
night and over the years it's been many

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.710 
night and over the years it's been many
changes<00:00:20.560> in<00:00:20.860> tobacco<00:00:21.369> in<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.300> early<00:00:22.540> days

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
changes in tobacco in the early days

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.170 
changes in tobacco in the early days
we'd<00:00:23.050> have<00:00:23.200> to<00:00:23.320> go<00:00:23.439> out<00:00:23.619> in<00:00:23.860> a<00:00:23.950> field<00:00:24.189> and<00:00:24.489> raise

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
we'd have to go out in a field and raise

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.850 
we'd have to go out in a field and raise
the<00:00:25.329> plants<00:00:25.630> on<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.900> ground<00:00:26.169> cover<00:00:26.590> them<00:00:26.800> up

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
the plants on the ground cover them up

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.920 
the plants on the ground cover them up
so<00:00:27.160> they<00:00:27.849> would<00:00:27.970> be<00:00:28.090> protected

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
so they would be protected

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.760 
so they would be protected
now<00:00:29.680> they<00:00:29.980> we<00:00:30.610> have<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.689> greenhouse<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.500> it

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
now they we have the greenhouse and it

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.590 
now they we have the greenhouse and it
makes<00:00:33.010> everything<00:00:33.340> easier<00:00:34.000> I'm<00:00:34.120> not<00:00:34.300> saying

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
makes everything easier I'm not saying

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.800 
makes everything easier I'm not saying
it's<00:00:34.840> cheaper<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:36.700> go<00:00:36.850> this<00:00:37.030> route<00:00:37.270> but<00:00:37.600> it's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
it's cheaper to go this route but it's

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.180 
it's cheaper to go this route but it's
easier<00:00:38.290> on<00:00:38.410> us<00:00:38.830> and<00:00:39.040> lot<00:00:39.190> less<00:00:39.850> labor<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.980> my

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
easier on us and lot less labor now my

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.890 
easier on us and lot less labor now my
grandfather<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.090> great-grandfather<00:00:43.270> I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
grandfather and great-grandfather I

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.470 
grandfather and great-grandfather I
suppose<00:00:44.470> planet<00:00:44.950> would<00:00:45.070> have<00:00:45.190> pegged<00:00:45.520> when

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
suppose planet would have pegged when

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.240 
suppose planet would have pegged when
they<00:00:46.600> used<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:47.050> pig<00:00:47.290> that<00:00:47.500> had<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.710> be<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.860> rainy

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
they used a pig that had to be a rainy

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.850 
they used a pig that had to be a rainy
wet<00:00:49.150> season<00:00:49.720> because<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.050> soil<00:00:50.320> had<00:00:50.590> to<00:00:50.710> be

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
wet season because the soil had to be

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.190 
wet season because the soil had to be
wet<00:00:51.130> before<00:00:51.790> they<00:00:52.120> put<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.450> plan<00:00:52.720> out<00:00:52.930> there

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
wet before they put the plan out there

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.580 
wet before they put the plan out there
in<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:54.850> time<00:00:55.240> we<00:00:55.510> come<00:00:55.720> up<00:00:55.900> with<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.200> call<00:00:56.410> of

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
in my time we come up with the call of

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.040 
in my time we come up with the call of
hand<00:00:56.860> setter<00:00:57.340> now<00:00:57.790> that<00:00:58.000> hand<00:00:58.270> seller<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.840> put

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
hand setter now that hand seller you put

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.650 
hand setter now that hand seller you put
the<00:00:59.140> plant<00:00:59.470> in<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:00.610> it<00:01:00.970> carried<00:01:01.270> this<00:01:01.420> water

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
the plant in and it carried this water

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.369 
the plant in and it carried this water
to<00:01:02.079> so<00:01:02.410> you<00:01:02.500> could<00:01:02.770> plant<00:01:02.980> by<00:01:03.730> hand<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.379> with

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
to so you could plant by hand and with

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.730 
to so you could plant by hand and with
the<00:01:05.590> water<00:01:05.799> all<00:01:06.130> at<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.490> same<00:01:06.700> time<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.740> doing

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
the water all at the same time and doing

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.039 
the water all at the same time and doing
the<00:01:08.860> changes<00:01:09.399> of<00:01:09.429> my<00:01:09.729> period<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.359> went<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.749> with

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
the changes of my period we went to with

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.770 
the changes of my period we went to with
all<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.409> trust<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.950> planter<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.399> we<00:01:12.729> get<00:01:12.939> to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
all the trust the planter that we get to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.569 
all the trust the planter that we get to
ride<00:01:14.259> on<00:01:14.289> the<00:01:14.679> back<00:01:14.859> of<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.130> planter<00:01:15.429> and

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
ride on the back of the planter and

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.510 
ride on the back of the planter and
place<00:01:15.819> the<00:01:16.030> plant<00:01:16.329> in<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.499> planter<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.369> it

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
place the plant in the planter and it

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.700 
place the plant in the planter and it
carried<00:01:18.789> it<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.030> gram<00:01:19.380> also<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.530> was<00:01:20.679> a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
carried it to the gram also it was a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.800 
carried it to the gram also it was a
barrel<00:01:21.340> on<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.579> tractor<00:01:22.179> that<00:01:22.359> carried<00:01:22.719> the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
barrel on the tractor that carried the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.719 
barrel on the tractor that carried the
water<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.499> could<00:01:23.679> put<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.859> water<00:01:24.159> down<00:01:24.460> as

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
water so we could put the water down as

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
water so we could put the water down as
we<00:01:24.999> plant

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
we plant

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.910 
we plant
nowaday<00:01:26.740> we<00:01:27.039> put<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.639> fertilizer<00:01:27.909> down<00:01:28.719> as<00:01:29.139> we

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
nowaday we put the fertilizer down as we

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.459 
nowaday we put the fertilizer down as we
plant<00:01:30.249> as<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.819> water<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.420> some<00:01:32.259> other

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
plant as the water and some other

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.199 
plant as the water and some other
chemicals<00:01:33.009> that<00:01:33.069> we<00:01:33.310> use<00:01:33.609> in<00:01:33.819> plant<00:01:34.090> in<00:01:34.149> the

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
chemicals that we use in plant in the

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.809 
chemicals that we use in plant in the
back<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:35.079> it<00:01:35.409> has<00:01:35.649> been<00:01:35.889> a<00:01:35.950> lot<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.219> changes<00:01:36.789> in

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
back so it has been a lot of changes in

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:37.709 
back so it has been a lot of changes in
my<00:01:37.119> time

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
my time

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.809 
my time
