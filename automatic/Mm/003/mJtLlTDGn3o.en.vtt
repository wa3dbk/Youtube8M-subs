00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.750
 she is recruiting world is mister kraft 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.699
 code and today we find ourselves for 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.189
 a new video we will talk about a 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.340
 fashion bottled fashion chain finally 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.320
 same modem petition mode what does 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.199
 does this mode go as you can you 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.920
 to doubt in the title the mob 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.180
 it will be able to be amputated so three 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.800
 maps can be amputated for the moment 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.370
 because he still knows a version in 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.850
 development 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.879
 so we have the skeleton the zombie and the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.670
 ping mail for zombie and zombie 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.250
 pigman there is blood so we go 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.070
 start with skeleton you have to know 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.760
 that there is more chance of arguing 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.189
 mob with a tool or a weapon in his hand 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.439
 it's finally there are few probabilities 

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:02.479
 so you can cut three members the 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:04.400
 head and both arms so we will try 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.520
 to take his arm off his right arm 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.170
 left end for him to move parenting 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.759
 oh you calm down here hey we got him 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.280
 taken off an arm so there you have to know 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.150
 that he has more than one arm so if the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.560
 skeleton has more than one arm there 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.630
 he can not attack you because 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.150
 beats for an art that is needed tomorrow from 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.480
 blow he can not attack you will fall 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.480
 shit 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.030
 ok my name to the butte and even if ever 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.290
 it's the arm arm that one that has not 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.760
 art that will not be able to attack you 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.360
 because he can not wait for his bow 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.830
 if ever wanted to cut off the head 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.930
 well he will only have a few 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.280
 seconds to live look here so 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.590
 after that it works pretty much the same in 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.740
 the head will disappear for pygmies 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.600
 my goal i'm line enchanted thing too 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.370
 had to cut an arm 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.750
 so there was blood declared my opinion 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.500
 can still attack us with his sword 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.460
 but if we cut him tomorrow times 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.810
 the more we do very much stone very 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.100
 good device the head she can seem 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.560
 that he is going to burst 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.940
 except that there is blood falling there 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.490
 down there you see there small particles 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.150
 to the mouths of sound and we also have the same 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:22.940
 thing for the zombie to go to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.320
 halde lost there he lost his head 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.520
 yeah that's me it or that finally me 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.230
 find this mode rather nice 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.310
 is called adding a little fun 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.440
 even if you are there you take points 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.520
 and rolled not a vain if you type in 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.410
 head you have chances of the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.480
 to burst right away finally all of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.060
 following there something close 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.430
 dallas in my more it's stylish 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 add a little fun to minecraft so 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.180
 plus a carrot that fell when I 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.390
 do not know if they disappeared after a 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.670
 moment yeah so here it is a little 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.550
 mode my for now he's here he has 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.040
 not a lot of fading fashion 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.959
 it still has in development version the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.900
 blood is added one there is no 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.060
 long time he was not there and not the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.780
 blow I guess this mabrouk mode is going 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.700
 progress 1 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.310
 he's going to see more and more mob and who 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.220
 are going to be added but hey I'll give it to you 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.020
 introduce that it adds fun and ben 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.640
 this is rather funny so the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.860
 link is there in the description that 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.450
 is called official topic 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.620
 the texture pack if you ask bah 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.910
 there 's no I do not think there's not if 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.250
 we never know the fesf crowd but I 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.130
 believe there are none and so bandits to
