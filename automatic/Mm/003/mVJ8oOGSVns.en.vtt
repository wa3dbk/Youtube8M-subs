important one of my big secret is that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.310 
important one of my big secret is that
first<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.940> was<00:00:36.180> classically<00:00:36.540> trained<00:00:37.079> with

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
first I was classically trained with

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
piano since I was four so I have that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
piano since I was four so I have that
classical<00:00:40.020> side<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> same<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
classical side but at the same time I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.950 
classical side but at the same time I
was<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> answer<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> classic

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
was at the answer so I have the classic

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
was at the answer so I have the classic
background<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> rhythm<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> think

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
background with the rhythm so I think

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850 
background with the rhythm so I think
that<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.600> gives<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> wide<00:00:46.350> range<00:00:46.680> of
