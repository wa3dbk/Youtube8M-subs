 we respect a usb cable in xbox and 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.770

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.840
 little brother in the heath who owes all 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.500
 for all your services that legal 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.290
 Thanks, microsoft. A young one is for you. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.350
 very good 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.390
 screen and sound 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.100
 here it has not changed but that has 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.489
 sound mixer 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.920
 here you can select if you want 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.770
 that the attached application stays with the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.700
 main sound the female main sound 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.700
 on the main screen 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:14.360
 the crazy kinect you can change that if 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:17.450
 you fix an application in xbox let's say 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.540
 crack or do you want to play with 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.300
 fixed and want to hear the sound of the cracco 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.750
 you come here in the options and changes places 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.430
 just to the pt if pal is rather on 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.810
 then silenced whenever you fix 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.840
 something here 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.600
 the main thing is to be silent if 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.730
 make sure you say fix the sound back 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.919
 of the main 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.220
 You can change this here, you can leave it. 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:48.140
 shadows and only the active main sound and 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.990
 the set off or leave the two normal 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.820
 which is the configuration that was neither the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.980
 next factory setting 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.320
 I usually use it when I'm playing 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.120
 Something I think of viewing 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.870
 Something here so your taste of 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.370
 have the sound set as the main 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.360
 every time I'm playing here I want 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.370
 listen to v1 detonated from youtube or 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.410
 Collectables so I'll watch the video here 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.150
 so I just have to listen to the sound of the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.500
 Fixed app so I think it's better 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.500
 this setting that I use here 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.560
 It's something that you did not have and now you have 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.750
 a chat mixer if you use the bat 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.430
 kinect chat you can is cool 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.460
 this is to reduce the volume and other 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.349
 noises and 80% so the sound will be fine 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.550
 better if you use kinect as bat 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:43.520
 reduce or reduce external noise by 50% 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.129
 How do I live near the street here? 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.080
 complicated to use our kinect 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.689
 reduces when I have using kinect on 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.960
 chat it will reduce by 80% the 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:58.639
 noises around in the going will leave the sound 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.879
 more pure only to yourselves have a choice 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.270
 zinha new that will configure tv and control 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.270
 to see 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.560
 that xbox will identify your tv 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.590
 here he has already identified the mark of my 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.919
 samsung 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:36.110
 which is put automatic O 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:42.530
 sent duck command make it mute the tv 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:44.419
 Yes, I did meet the tv with fig. 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.069
 configured I think it's for you 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:53.870
 to change the sound of tv through xbox with commands 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:56.030
 I have not tested it yet. 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.360
 now he already recognizes the model of my 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.360
 TV 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:06.080
 you have to change volume with the voice command 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:10.599
 in three steps in four steps I do not 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:14.389
 I tested it but it's a new option and let 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:19.969
 you can put your full name 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:23.150
 side of the game tag and you can choose 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:25.759
 will share your name with your 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.430
 friends and friends of friends 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.710
 you can choose only your friends or 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.449
 everybody friends and friends of friends 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.449
 to share your name 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:43.210
 basically this was to some 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.210
 updates there 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.860

 not much is change is are changes 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:00.300
 but it seems that Microsoft is 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:04.069
 going the right way I hope that 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.229
