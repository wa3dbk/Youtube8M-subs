00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
it's like well they just did all that

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.770 
it's like well they just did all that
for<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:08.069> for<00:04:08.310> not<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:08.519> no<00:04:08.879> reason<00:04:09.180> they<00:04:09.569> just

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
for not for not for no reason they just

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.240 
for not for not for no reason they just
escaped<00:04:10.229> I<00:04:10.409> just<00:04:10.680> went<00:04:10.829> through<00:04:10.889> all<00:04:11.129> this

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
escaped I just went through all this

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.189 
escaped I just went through all this
hell<00:04:11.489> just<00:04:12.209> pretty<00:04:12.510> much<00:04:12.629> is<00:04:12.780> toward<00:04:13.109> the

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
hell just pretty much is toward the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:18.409 
hell just pretty much is toward the
building<00:04:13.409> down<00:04:13.769> around<00:04:14.129> them<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:17.419> there's

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
building down around them and there's

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.180 
building down around them and there's
nothing<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.840> prove<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.470> they're<00:04:19.919> still

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
nothing to prove like they're still

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.039 
nothing to prove like they're still
monsters<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:20.789> very<00:04:20.969> end<00:04:21.209> as<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.719> think<00:04:21.930> it's

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
monsters in the very end as I think it's

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.520 
monsters in the very end as I think it's
really<00:04:22.169> sad<00:04:22.500> like<00:04:23.120> really<00:04:24.120> sad<00:04:24.770> yeah

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
really sad like really sad yeah

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.550 
really sad like really sad yeah
think<00:04:26.710> that's<00:04:27.090> what<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.210> more<00:04:29.110> or<00:04:29.200> less<00:04:29.350> is

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
think that's what it more or less is

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.440 
think that's what it more or less is
about<00:04:29.889> more<00:04:30.490> or<00:04:30.639> less<00:04:30.820> I'm<00:04:31.030> not<00:04:31.180> exactly

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450
