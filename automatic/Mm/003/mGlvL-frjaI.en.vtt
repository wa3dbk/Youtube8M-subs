studied<00:01:56.040> sea<00:01:56.430> lions<00:01:56.909> since<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> 1980s<00:01:58.140> he

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
studied sea lions since the 1980s he

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.010 
studied sea lions since the 1980s he
collects<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.490> examines<00:01:59.969> sea<00:02:00.149> lion<00:02:00.420> droppings

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
collects and examines sea lion droppings

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.950 
collects and examines sea lion droppings
to<00:02:01.590> find<00:02:01.799> out<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> animals<00:02:02.610> are<00:02:02.700> eating

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
to find out what the animals are eating

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.690 
to find out what the animals are eating
now<00:02:03.960> he<00:02:04.020> says<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.560> typical<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.340> type<00:02:05.670> of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
now he says it's typical for one type of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.240 
now he says it's typical for one type of
food<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.329> dominate<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.170> sea<00:02:07.380> lion<00:02:07.740> diet<00:02:08.009> when

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
food to dominate the sea lion diet when

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.940 
food to dominate the sea lion diet when
things<00:02:08.489> are<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.789> well<00:02:09.259> market<00:02:10.259> squid<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.920> a

things are going well market squid are a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.280 
things are going well market squid are a

happened during a sea lion pup die-off

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.370 
happened during a sea lion pup die-off
in<00:02:33.860> 2009<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:35.250> year<00:02:35.849> when<00:02:36.000> El<00:02:36.239> Nino<00:02:36.750> moved<00:02:37.200> the

another<00:02:43.890> possibility<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.299> current

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
another possibility is that the current

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.589 
another possibility is that the current
population<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:46.500> about<00:02:46.819> 300,000<00:02:47.819> sea<00:02:47.970> lions<00:02:48.390> is

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
population of about 300,000 sea lions is

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.080 
population of about 300,000 sea lions is
just<00:02:49.170> too<00:02:49.319> large<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.400> ability<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
just too large the ability of the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.330 
just too large the ability of the
environment<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.110> sustain<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> population<00:02:52.709> that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
environment to sustain a population that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.910 
environment to sustain a population that
only<00:02:53.640> changes<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.480> down<00:02:54.630> nothing<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.440> so

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
only changes up and down nothing and so

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.470 
only changes up and down nothing and so
it's<00:02:56.160> probably<00:02:56.489> dropped<00:02:56.760> down<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.970> little<00:02:57.239> bit

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
it's probably dropped down a little bit

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.750 
it's probably dropped down a little bit
and<00:02:58.049> it's<00:02:58.319> affecting<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:58.920> population<00:02:59.069> he's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
and it's affecting the population he's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.940 
and it's affecting the population he's
that's<00:02:59.970> what<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.180> think<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.660> happening<00:03:00.950> sea

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that's what I think is happening sea

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.410 
that's what I think is happening sea
