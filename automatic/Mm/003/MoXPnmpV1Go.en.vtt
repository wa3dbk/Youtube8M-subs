00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.469
 really learn from it is really bad 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:00.300

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.010
 throw our chips up and then yes we 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.080
 go to see how ending it 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.369
 feels like having a few more 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 Inteligence points needed with him 17 more 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.790
 intelligence needed oh wow ok so that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.530
 on training 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.479
 I go to do my king job I go 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.490
 don't yeah I think then it goes 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.830
 but others take a look at what is this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
 wall still broken 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
 ok well that still broke him okay 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.659
 that was just that was my 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.990
 first question was still broken 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 ideal it is that okay i go quickly 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.079
 my critical view and there briefly 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.520
 call in my things because if I do 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.780
 namely different because things in on then 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.500
 the alarm goes off and then we become 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.729
 cut 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.780
 and we don't want that, we don't want that 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.060
 cut what had cardinal and okay 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.770
 the school of other people I had one 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.180
 take a completely different job 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.180
 actually always the first little look 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 the good tire you but that was it 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.750
 not really needed that much 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.700
 Escape this tcpc prison 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.130
 villainies very difficult you have to on 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.530
 do more but the previous one but yes 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.460
 ultimately I mean what we have now 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.200
 because I want to say but 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.050
 yes it works pretty well it was fun though 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.440
 brother it is it is not difficult or something 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.630
 so yes i hope that the next 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.950
 jail what that is then normal this 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.560
 does not fill it that much 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.660
 it makes a difference i have i got it then 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.620
 present is going to be super difficult 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.240
 but okay I also very little final 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.830

 intel it is training up yes so 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.380
 it is difficult but then I know 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.420

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.650

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.190
 until I have a certain value often 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.120
 quite satisfied with it or for the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.430
