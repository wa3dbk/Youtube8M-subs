this<00:00:00.269> is<00:00:00.390> Ryan<00:00:00.659> with<00:00:00.840> competitive<00:00:01.380> cyclists

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
this is Ryan with competitive cyclists

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.650 
this is Ryan with competitive cyclists
and<00:00:01.979> these<00:00:02.280> are<00:00:02.460> edge<00:00:02.639> mountain<00:00:03.210> rims<00:00:08.660> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
and these are edge mountain rims the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.209 
and these are edge mountain rims the
first<00:00:09.900> thing<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.200> notice<00:00:10.380> about<00:00:10.590> edge<00:00:10.889> rims

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
first thing you notice about edge rims

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.499 
first thing you notice about edge rims
is<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.550> they're<00:00:11.700> made<00:00:11.910> entirely<00:00:12.330> from

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
is that they're made entirely from

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.049 
is that they're made entirely from
carbon-fiber<00:00:13.190> then<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.280> might<00:00:14.460> wonder<00:00:14.639> how

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
carbon-fiber then you might wonder how

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.060 
carbon-fiber then you might wonder how
could<00:00:15.570> they<00:00:15.690> possibly<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.320> durable<00:00:16.710> enough<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
could they possibly be durable enough to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.680 
could they possibly be durable enough to
be<00:00:17.190> ridden<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.580> real<00:00:17.910> trails

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
be ridden on real trails

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.500 
be ridden on real trails
well<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.800> shouldn't<00:00:20.070> worry<00:00:20.310> edge<00:00:20.699> composite

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
well you shouldn't worry edge composite
