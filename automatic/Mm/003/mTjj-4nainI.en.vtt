can use and again keeping in mind that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.080 
can use and again keeping in mind that
the<00:02:45.620> power<00:02:45.830> characters<00:02:46.370> use<00:02:46.549> them<00:02:46.700> some<00:02:46.910> way

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the power characters use them some way

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.120 
the power characters use them some way
the<00:02:47.540> gadget<00:02:47.930> characters<00:02:48.320> uses<00:02:48.650> another<00:02:48.920> way

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
the gadget characters uses another way

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.070 
the gadget characters uses another way
and<00:02:49.340> that's<00:02:49.790> really<00:02:50.299> kind<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.720> what<00:02:50.870> we're

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
and that's really kind of what we're

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.259 
and that's really kind of what we're
really<00:02:51.230> using<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.680> mix<00:02:51.950> up<00:02:52.130> this<00:02:52.310> whole<00:02:52.580> kind

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
really using to mix up this whole kind

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.970 
really using to mix up this whole kind
of<00:02:53.420> fighting<00:02:53.780> game<00:02:53.989> formula<00:02:54.590> here<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:54.830> we

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
of fighting game formula here is we

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.259 
of fighting game formula here is we
really<00:02:55.250> want<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.519> kind<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.760> distinguish

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
really want to kind of distinguish

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.570 
really want to kind of distinguish
between<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.720> different<00:02:57.080> characters<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
between the different characters and the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:13.179 
between the different characters and the
different<00:02:58.940> arenas<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.390> are<00:02:59.660> in<00:02:59.780> there

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.000 

now<00:03:14.189> give<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.459> another<00:03:14.670> example<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
now give you another example of the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.750 
now give you another example of the
Batman<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.129> actually<00:03:17.430> use<00:03:17.670> his<00:03:19.430> his<00:03:20.430> bat

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
Batman can actually use his his bat

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.459 
Batman can actually use his his bat
surrounding<00:03:21.750> him<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.049> number<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.319> different

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:22.469 
surrounding him in a number of different

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.199 
surrounding him in a number of different
ways

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.759 

now<00:03:27.209> he's<00:03:27.359> gonna<00:03:27.420> throw<00:03:27.689> selma<00:03:28.230> Grundy<00:03:28.530> down

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
now he's gonna throw selma Grundy down

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.399 
now he's gonna throw selma Grundy down
through<00:03:29.189> this<00:03:29.400> building<00:03:29.879> into<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.719> third<00:03:31.079> arena

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
through this building into a third arena

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:46.839 
through this building into a third arena
down<00:03:31.650> at<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.919> bottom<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:40.590> obviously<00:03:41.010> okay

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.959 

and<00:03:48.169> again<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:50.010> thing<00:03:50.219> to<00:03:50.310> keep<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.579> mind<00:03:50.819> is

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:50.969 
and again the thing to keep in mind is

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.610 
and again the thing to keep in mind is
you<00:03:51.120> know<00:03:51.239> each<00:03:51.449> one<00:03:51.719> of<00:03:51.840> these<00:03:51.959> arenas<00:03:52.290> has<00:03:52.590> a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
you know each one of these arenas has a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.949 
you know each one of these arenas has a
different<00:03:53.069> palette<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.689> objects<00:03:54.689> I<00:03:54.750> think

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
different palette of objects I think

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.360 
different palette of objects I think
that<00:03:55.079> both<00:03:55.319> characters<00:03:55.799> can<00:03:55.949> use<00:03:56.159> in

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
that both characters can use in

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:05.220 
that both characters can use in
different<00:03:56.849> ways

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.229 

lining<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.250> top<00:04:06.430> here<00:04:06.610> we're<00:04:06.760> back<00:04:06.940> at<00:04:07.150> our

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
lining on the top here we're back at our

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:19.890 
lining on the top here we're back at our
original<00:04:07.360> arena<00:04:07.959> here<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:19.600> we're<00:04:19.750> going<00:04:19.780> to

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
original arena here now we're going to

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900 
original arena here now we're going to
give<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.109> an<00:04:20.260> idea<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.650> some<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:20.889> these<00:04:21.100> super

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
give you an idea of some of these super

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.310 
give you an idea of some of these super
moves<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.419> carrots<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:22.750> can<00:04:22.810> do<00:04:23.080> each

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
moves that the carrots you can do each

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.040 
moves that the carrots you can do each
character<00:04:23.830> kind<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.270> fires<00:04:25.270> off<00:04:25.570> his<00:04:25.810> super

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
character kind of fires off his super

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.360 
character kind of fires off his super
movement<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.470> different<00:04:26.830> way<00:04:26.949> we<00:04:27.160> really

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
movement a different way we really

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.710 
movement a different way we really
wanted<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.699> kind<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:27.940> distinguish<00:04:28.510> between

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
wanted to kind of distinguish between

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.650 
wanted to kind of distinguish between
the<00:04:29.110> different<00:04:29.310> gameplay<00:04:30.310> styles<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
the different gameplay styles of the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.270 
the different gameplay styles of the
characters<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.620> they<00:04:32.740> have<00:04:32.889> different

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
characters so they have different

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.980 
characters so they have different
methods<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.790> doing<00:04:33.880> Batman's<00:04:34.419> right<00:04:34.660> here<00:04:34.870> is

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
methods of doing Batman's right here is

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.360 
methods of doing Batman's right here is
like<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.139> peri<00:04:35.530> move<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.949> he<00:04:36.040> actually

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
like a peri move that he actually

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.659 
like a peri move that he actually
triggers<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.660> he's<00:04:37.810> actually<00:04:38.160> it's<00:04:39.160> using

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
triggers and he's actually it's using

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.070 
triggers and he's actually it's using
them<00:04:39.760> Lucky's<00:04:40.090> little<00:04:40.360> more<00:04:40.479> of<00:04:40.539> a<00:04:40.600> defensive

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
them Lucky's little more of a defensive

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.930 
them Lucky's little more of a defensive
way<00:04:41.260> kind<00:04:41.470> of<00:04:41.530> like<00:04:41.590> Johnny<00:04:41.919> Cage<00:04:42.220> was<00:04:42.490> from

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
way kind of like Johnny Cage was from

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.170 
way kind of like Johnny Cage was from
Mortal<00:04:43.389> Kombat

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.450 

whereas<00:04:49.180> solomon<00:04:49.570> grundy<00:04:50.010> again<00:04:51.010> he's<00:04:51.220> kind

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
whereas solomon grundy again he's kind

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.920 
whereas solomon grundy again he's kind
of<00:04:51.520> like<00:04:51.639> he<00:04:51.760> comes<00:04:52.120> in<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:52.360> different<00:04:52.660> mode

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
of like he comes in this different mode

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.500 
of like he comes in this different mode
and<00:04:53.289> then<00:04:53.470> he<00:04:53.729> he<00:04:54.729> continues<00:04:55.570> this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.540 

he<00:05:00.050> pulls<00:05:00.320> out<00:05:00.410> his<00:05:00.470> tombstone<00:05:00.830> over<00:05:01.220> his<00:05:01.340> head

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
he pulls out his tombstone over his head

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.950 
he pulls out his tombstone over his head
and<00:05:01.730> knocks<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.060> over<00:05:07.450> so<00:05:08.450> again<00:05:08.660> this<00:05:08.810> gives

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
and knocks it over so again this gives

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.930 
and knocks it over so again this gives
you<00:05:09.110> an<00:05:09.230> idea<00:05:09.380> of<00:05:09.770> kind<00:05:09.950> of<00:05:10.070> like<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.460> the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
you an idea of kind of like the the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.750
