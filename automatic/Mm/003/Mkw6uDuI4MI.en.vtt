00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.850
 curious because today more than fed up 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.239
 well it's everyone these 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.030
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.670
 new video of friends I know you 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.320
 will finally say yes but hey you know 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.400
 we are all entitled to a blow of the pump 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.190
 all were entitled to questioning 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.559
 and I believe that you are numerous because 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.140
 unfortunately I had to put a title 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.110
 who will make you come who will you 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.269
 to doubt who will scare you 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.830
 hungry the reasons and well listened during 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.269
 this video I explain to you and already 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.519
 why there was this break 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.620
 and why does it smell the end of an end 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.530
 adventure play video game first and foremost 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.080
 because there is not only youtube in life 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.259
 in game unfortunately I want to 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.600
 to say finally rather happily because 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.690
 we're going to say that youtube these two 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 great emotions but it's also forgiveness 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.470
 great disappointments 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.160
 so why the reasons but everything 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.780
 just like you noticed that 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.940
 to do more than four weeks that I 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.770
 did not come out real videos then 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.479
 that what I mean by real video not 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.649
 real videos I just hear 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.509
 videos I worked on 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.299
 top and videos that have a purpose 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.610
 you know - the videos I released 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.100
 the last three these two good strips 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.740
 both stream warpath the stamp 1 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.030
 it's really not hard at all and 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.820
 yet they worked very well 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.820
 two after I took you out activate the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.369
 music more success diaries thing very 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.770
 sincerely I hesitated to delete because 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.119
 I simply saw that thousands 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.070
 hundreds of youtube hours have 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.329
 got out life in two months on that 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.670
 frankly I do not really see the interest 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.369
 so the only video for which I 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.899
 worked on this last month it was 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.040
 very presentation of america steria 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.600
 who liked it 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.729
 I'm pretty happy and there is also 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.730
 big debate the video games are they 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.030
 dangerous and this video there frankly 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.620
 I was expecting a lot better than that 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.720
 because simply the potato 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.010
 she did not reach enough high rate 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.780
 of hearing so when I say rate 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.160
 of hearing it's no more davud for me 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.920
 make more money 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.810
 it's just that my 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.570
 subscribers see the video and I was expecting 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.070
 to what is still more than 1238 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.739
 subscribers who are interested in that good 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.350
 after it's clear it was cool I got 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.680
 many klai look a little shadow of 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.269
 view 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.379
 sue it's really very nice I saw 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.909
 in the comments that it liked so 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.159
 been really happy to have it 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.819
 proposed as stated in the comments 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.079
 it's just my best debate 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.579
 and I wash or that's my best debate 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.659
 same time it was the one who took me the 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.239
 more time and it's the longer one 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.099
 because I can assure you that 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.319
 watch and I'm not kidding 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.090
 reports from France 2 and France 3 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.319
 makes you want to shoot you 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.930
 but a sick thing 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.150
 finally short and unfortunately I 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.120
 notice I notice that the real ones 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.040
 videos like that listened less 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.069
 subscribers and report less audience 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.680
 for example that for example 2 stream 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.700
 or so diaries bourdarie his share of 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.720
 market goes on like Thursday and some 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.480
 hundreds of youtube that we do the same 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.959
 thing but finally here is a fair for 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.900
 tell you 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.090
 and this is the proof that this youtube 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.129
 the more we work it is not necessarily 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.260
 knows more rewarded and his rooms 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.650
 painted from this platform is acquired 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.269
 me who really gives me more desire to 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.450
 all continue one is still it would be 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.109
 that frankly it does not matter 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.299
 but during these four weeks of nothing 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.159
 Foutism I do not know if it's finally said 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.780
 that's what I did not screw up I got 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.639
 questioned and I told myself 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.639
 is youtube so important that 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.199
 that's the videos are that 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.840
 the video games by which are so 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.030
 important than that and frankly that's 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.430
 an answer I would not have had 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.919
 the hope of having this is an answer that 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.989
 scares me and this answer all 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.639
 simply no video games are not 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.639
 so important youtube has gone 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.470
 important then that's going to make more of 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.159
 in no we will do more than 1 year then 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.229
 on Youtube 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.509
 it's going to be more than four years since I 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.729
 am I am call of duty and I am scared 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.639
 to tell me that in fact I simply 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.530
 lost my time because when we look at it 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.759
 closer to the community she's trying 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.250
 to explode the friends she is 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.509
 completely exploding is not 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.680
 to see the latest videos that are 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.750
 out 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.139
 for example domina farting a cable 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.880
 you have days that have farted too 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.949
 a cable on his video about girls and 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.570
 we have sir j the ol furax 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.070
 no, but really, I really have that 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.539
 community fart a cable and that makes the 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.460
 quite frankly it's good because 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.169
 that I say to myself phew I may not be 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.970
 the only one to whom it happens 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.250
 I have also g km walk in the same 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.380
 situation that me and frankly I'm 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.820
 Say it feels good because I see 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.620
 other youtuber who are in the process of 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.300
 react and who would have the community that 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.699
 degrade and react and that 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.310
 it's good it's a good because 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.810
 frankly jojo video and video 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.349
 dominates these two videos that I had 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.509
 already done 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.780
 Months ago months ago 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.070
 of this finally here is all this for 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.020
 to tell you that I really took 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.550
 a lot of hindsight and I came to the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.610
 answer that it was not so important 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.710
 but as I still take a whole 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.660
 all little bit of fun and what 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.400
 gives me pleasure and his very sincere 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.800
 1 it's not sucks balls it's 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.849
 really you they are behind you 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.340
 that they have from there for me 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.630
 you who are there to wait but video 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.190
 frankly I can not you 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.760
 give up because I threw myself into a 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.289
 youtube adventure where I harvested more than 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.500
 2400 people because what I find 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.479
 funny is because some and funds or to 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.919
 2401 bonnet ben yeah bah you could 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.409
 do better but what they understand 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.240
 not people is it's not 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.490
 youtube figures it's people 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.190
 when I have two thousand four hundred 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.960
 subscribers g 2400 people do you 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.000
 count 2400 people what is it 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.919
 that it's in a room where then there is 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.130
 a guy who was me were watching on your 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.110
 big unpacking and videos tafer 1238 view 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.740
 whereas you had at the time 2000 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.599
 subscribers but wait at the same minus 1200 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.210
 38 people in a room and you're going 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.590
 see if it was very sincerely 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.699
 that still makes me want to 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.020
 continue because I think there are 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.159
 people who are behind there are some 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.020
 people who are there there are 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.490
 people who are there for me and the 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.770
 work I want to return it to you 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.150
 me you know I do not eat my words and 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.900
 I am dacc on youtube I have a small 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.500
 mission it's up to you to put your finger 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.690
 where it's not going and 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.040
 a little bit of debate and xu see if you have 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.050
 the same thought as me see if I'm 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.570
 in the fake or maybe give you back 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.950
 you in the right way 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.050
 that was just for you 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:53.520
 to prevent why I had not left 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.800
 of video is also a big info 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.870
 frankly we were not waiting for you anymore 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.940
 have two three videos a week because 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.650
 I'll just go to a 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.510
 video per week maximum 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.070
 not even a minimum but really a 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.090
 video per week maximum because everything 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.440
 just now I'm going to have 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.090
 three weeks of internship because it takes 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.560
 know that on a network in belgium 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.750
 the early stop is the sixth year 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.650
 secondary so it's the terminal at 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.990
 so you're actually it's my last 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.660
 year of course and I have three weeks of 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.110
 internship where I finish every day at 17h 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.660
 30 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.640
 and then ben you know me I do not know 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.830
 here is justin and internships I go back to 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.060
 videos not frankly I remember 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.680
 to hide a gym so 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.470
 Frankly I would really like 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.820
 less time to devote to games 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.320
 youtube videos and that's besides for 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.030
 that I had to leave matignon 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.980
 because I was not going at all anymore but investing 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.310
 but I made the choice to leave the 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.350
 team 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.000

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.260

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.690

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.430

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.780

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.060
