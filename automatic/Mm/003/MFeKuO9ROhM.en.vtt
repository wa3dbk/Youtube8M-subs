well<00:00:00.329> what<00:00:00.630> it<00:00:00.750> means<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.170> them<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.560> first<00:00:01.829> of

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
well what it means to them is first of

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.030 
well what it means to them is first of
all<00:00:02.270> we<00:00:03.270> are<00:00:03.300> all<00:00:03.419> connected<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:04.259> mean<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.830> think

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
all we are all connected I mean I think

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.920 
all we are all connected I mean I think
the<00:00:05.130> most<00:00:05.359> fundamental<00:00:06.359> thing<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.720> we're<00:00:06.899> all

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the most fundamental thing is we're all

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.290 
the most fundamental thing is we're all
connected<00:00:07.379> by<00:00:07.830> an<00:00:07.980> energy<00:00:08.130> field<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:08.970> swim<00:00:09.269> in

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
connected by an energy field we swim in

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.540 
connected by an energy field we swim in
a<00:00:09.540> sea<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.780> light<00:00:10.110> basically<00:00:10.740> which<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
a sea of light basically which is the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.570 
a sea of light basically which is the
zero-point<00:00:12.030> field<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.500> say<00:00:14.070> first<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.490> all

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
zero-point field and I say first of all

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.760 
zero-point field and I say first of all
you<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.820> get<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:16.049> get<00:00:16.170> away<00:00:16.410> from<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
you have to get to you get away from the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
you have to get to you get away from the
whole<00:00:16.980> idea<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.460> separateness<00:00:17.910> because

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
whole idea of separateness because

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.880 
whole idea of separateness because
separateness<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> biggest<00:00:19.500> problem<00:00:19.680> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
separateness is the biggest problem of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.130 
separateness is the biggest problem of
the<00:00:19.980> world<00:00:20.010> we're<00:00:20.430> sending<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> receiving

of different names for it the vacuum the

of different names for it the vacuum the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
vacuum the loose construction is call it

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.420 
vacuum the loose construction is call it
the<00:01:12.510> zero-point<00:01:13.020> field<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the zero-point field and I like the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
the zero-point field and I like the
zero-point<00:01:14.909> field<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.869> speaks<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.439> us

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
zero-point field because it speaks to us

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
zero-point field because it speaks to us
it's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.400> metaphor<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.479> an<00:01:18.600> easier

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it's a good metaphor and it's an easier

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.980 
it's a good metaphor and it's an easier
one<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> digest<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.400> think<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:21.060> many<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
one to digest I think then many of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.289 
one to digest I think then many of the
other<00:01:22.020> kinds<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.530> metaphors<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.520> lower

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
other kinds of metaphors for this lower

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.890 
other kinds of metaphors for this lower
ground<00:01:24.840> state<00:01:25.320> energy<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.299> very

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
ground state energy but it's a very

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.130 
ground state energy but it's a very
important<00:01:28.439> aspect<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> energy<00:01:29.340> because

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
important aspect of energy because

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
important aspect of energy because
governments<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.619> organizations

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
governments like you know organizations

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
governments like you know organizations
like<00:01:32.610> NASA<00:01:32.850> British<00:01:33.479> Aerospace<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.380> all

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
like NASA British Aerospace are all

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.330 
like NASA British Aerospace are all
trying<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> tap<00:01:35.070> into<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.630> incredible

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
trying to tap into this incredible

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.730 
trying to tap into this incredible
unimaginably<00:01:38.340> large<00:01:38.729> energy<00:01:39.540> sea<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.110> they

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
unimaginably large energy sea and they

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.980 
unimaginably large energy sea and they
feel<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.549> tap<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> travel

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
feel if they can tap this we can travel

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
feel if they can tap this we can travel
to<00:01:43.140> different<00:01:43.290> galaxies<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.340> understand

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
to different galaxies so they understand

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.960 
to different galaxies so they understand
that<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.299> empty<00:01:45.659> space<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
that in empty space there is this

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
that in empty space there is this
unbelievable<00:01:48.049> energy<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:50.070> doing<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
unbelievable energy but we are doing a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
unbelievable energy but we are doing a
little<00:01:50.670> energy<00:01:51.180> dance<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:52.110> time

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
little energy dance all the time

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.230 
little energy dance all the time
not<00:01:52.979> only<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.369> photons<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.119> we're

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
not only with the photons that we're

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.260 
not only with the photons that we're
