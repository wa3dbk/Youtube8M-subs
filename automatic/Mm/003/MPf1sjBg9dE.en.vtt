00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280 

okay<00:00:05.640> so<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.120> tutorial<00:00:06.390> what<00:00:07.170> we're

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
okay so in this tutorial what we're

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.870 
okay so in this tutorial what we're
going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> be<00:00:07.559> doing<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:08.099> we're<00:00:08.519> going<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.760> be

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
going to be doing is we're going to be

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.360 
going to be doing is we're going to be
creating<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.599> polygon<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.440> replicating<00:00:11.280> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
creating a polygon and replicating it

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.320 
creating a polygon and replicating it
down<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> curve<00:00:12.590> this<00:00:13.590> should<00:00:13.980> get<00:00:14.130> us<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.550> shape

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
down a curve this should get us a shape

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.060 
down a curve this should get us a shape
similar<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.930> one<00:00:16.019> we've<00:00:16.199> got<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.410> but

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
similar to the one we've got here but

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.710 
similar to the one we've got here but
you<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.789> wherever<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> want

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you can do this with wherever you want

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.779 
you can do this with wherever you want
really

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
really

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.370 
really
so<00:00:20.789> we're<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> start<00:00:22.200> a<00:00:22.350> new<00:00:23.119> area<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
so we're going to start a new area and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.930 
so we're going to start a new area and
then<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:26.010> would<00:00:26.100> them<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.789> we're

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
then what would them do first we're

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.359 
then what would them do first we're
going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> create<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.449> curve<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> we're<00:00:29.250> going

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
going to create a curve so we're going

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460 
going to create a curve so we're going
to<00:00:29.460> go<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> create<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.170> gonna<00:00:31.260> go

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to go to create and then we're gonna go

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.000 
to go to create and then we're gonna go
CP<00:00:32.219> curve<00:00:32.460> tool<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.359> then<00:00:33.899> we're<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.559> for

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
CP curve tool and then we're just for

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
CP curve tool and then we're just for
this<00:00:35.670> exercise<00:00:36.179> going<00:00:36.449> to<00:00:36.569> create<00:00:36.749> any<00:00:36.899> old

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this exercise going to create any old

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.649 
this exercise going to create any old
random<00:00:37.319> curve<00:00:37.769> so<00:00:38.670> we've<00:00:39.120> created<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.449> curve

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:39.659 
random curve so we've created a curve

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.829 
random curve so we've created a curve
press<00:00:40.140> Enter<00:00:40.559> -<00:00:41.069> okay<00:00:41.539> now<00:00:42.539> we're<00:00:42.780> gonna

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
press Enter - okay now we're gonna

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.899 
press Enter - okay now we're gonna
create<00:00:43.229> a<00:00:43.289> polygon<00:00:43.769> to<00:00:43.979> replicate<00:00:44.460> down<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
create a polygon to replicate down that

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.639 
create a polygon to replicate down that
curve<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.569> we're<00:00:46.229> gonna<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> cylinder

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
curve so we're gonna go for a cylinder

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.139 
curve so we're gonna go for a cylinder
the<00:00:49.649> cylinder<00:00:49.679> is<00:00:50.159> facing<00:00:50.549> the<00:00:50.639> wrong<00:00:50.760> way<00:00:50.819> we

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the cylinder is facing the wrong way we

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.419 
the cylinder is facing the wrong way we
want<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.479> going<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.839> that<00:00:52.019> way<00:00:52.280> down<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
want to be going in that way down the

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.479 
want to be going in that way down the
curve<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.059> we'll<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.959> the<00:00:55.170> properties<00:00:55.649> will

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
curve so we'll go to the properties will

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.599 
curve so we'll go to the properties will
change<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> rotation<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.780> x-axis<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.609> 90

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
change the rotation in the x-axis to 90

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.840 
change the rotation in the x-axis to 90
degrees<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.179> we've<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.260> changed<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
degrees and we've now changed that it's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
degrees and we've now changed that it's
also<00:01:02.999> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.580> too<00:01:05.580> long<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.590> we'll

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
also a little bit too long so we'll

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
also a little bit too long so we'll
press<00:01:07.860> R<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.370> keyboard<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.060> we'll

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
press R on the keyboard and then we'll

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
press R on the keyboard and then we'll
just<00:01:09.900> scale<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> therefore<00:01:12.300> it's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
just scale it down so therefore it's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.960 
just scale it down so therefore it's
thinner

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
thinner

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.620 
thinner
and<00:01:14.320> now<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:15.380> don't<00:01:15.650> need<00:01:15.980> to<00:01:16.250> move<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.480> we

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
and now we don't need to move it but we

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.680 
and now we don't need to move it but we
select<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.860> then<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:20.000> select<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.390> curve

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
select it and then we select the curve

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.260 
select it and then we select the curve
and<00:01:21.340> what<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:22.490> do<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.940> we<00:01:23.240> go<00:01:23.390> up<00:01:23.600> to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.039 

animate<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.710> then<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:30.490> go<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:32.549> motion<00:01:33.549> paths

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
animate and then we go to motion paths

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.340 
animate and then we go to motion paths
attached<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.290> motion<00:01:35.680> paths<00:01:36.270> now<00:01:37.270> in<00:01:38.170> our

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
attached to motion paths now in our

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.410 
attached to motion paths now in our
example<00:01:39.009> we<00:01:39.430> can<00:01:39.580> just<00:01:39.729> leave<00:01:39.880> that<00:01:40.060> as<00:01:40.149> time

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
example we can just leave that as time

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.630 
example we can just leave that as time
slider<00:01:41.310> front<00:01:42.310> axis<00:01:42.759> must<00:01:42.939> be<00:01:43.090> set<00:01:43.299> to<00:01:43.329> Y<00:01:44.640> that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
slider front axis must be set to Y that

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.249 
slider front axis must be set to Y that
you<00:01:45.850> may<00:01:46.000> have<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.360> play<00:01:46.539> around<00:01:46.720> with<00:01:46.899> this<00:01:47.049> if

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
you may have to play around with this if

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.200 
you may have to play around with this if
you're<00:01:47.409> working<00:01:47.649> in<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.979> different<00:01:48.280> axis<00:01:48.729> and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
you're working in the different axis and

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.330 
you're working in the different axis and
also<00:01:49.450> Bank<00:01:49.929> must<00:01:50.350> be<00:01:50.500> tipped<00:01:50.770> I've<00:01:51.070> already

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
also Bank must be tipped I've already

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.850 
also Bank must be tipped I've already
got<00:01:51.549> these<00:01:51.670> I've<00:01:52.090> done<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.390> previously<00:01:52.860> we

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
got these I've done this previously we

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.490 
got these I've done this previously we
here<00:01:54.070> touch<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.700> now<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.479> polygon<00:01:56.259> has

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
here touch and now the polygon has

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.820 
here touch and now the polygon has
attached<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.399> path<00:01:58.049> next<00:01:59.049> up<00:01:59.170> we<00:01:59.380> go<00:01:59.500> back

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
attached to the path next up we go back

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.639 
attached to the path next up we go back
up<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.250> animate<00:02:00.640> then<00:02:01.569> we<00:02:01.810> go<00:02:01.959> to<00:02:02.020> create

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
up to animate then we go to create

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.510 
up to animate then we go to create
animation<00:02:03.429> snapshot<00:02:04.209> now<00:02:05.039> here<00:02:06.039> we've<00:02:06.250> got<00:02:06.399> it

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
animation snapshot now here we've got it

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.880 
animation snapshot now here we've got it
from<00:02:06.700> start<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.360> end<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:08.289> we've<00:02:08.590> got<00:02:08.799> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
from start to end and we've got the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.759 
from start to end and we've got the
start<00:02:09.160> time<00:02:09.459> one<00:02:10.299> so<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.840> first<00:02:11.110> frame<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.680> our

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
start time one so the first frame in our

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.930 
start time one so the first frame in our
time<00:02:12.040> slider<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.930> 24<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.400> end<00:02:15.580> time

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
time slider and then 24 for the end time

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.509 
time slider and then 24 for the end time
because<00:02:16.600> there's<00:02:16.780> 24<00:02:17.290> frames<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.220> change

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
because there's 24 frames you can change

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.660 
because there's 24 frames you can change
this<00:02:18.790> down<00:02:19.060> here<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.569> want<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.340> we're<00:02:21.519> not

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
this down here if you want but we're not

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.259 
this down here if you want but we're not
going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.620> increment<00:02:24.220> just<00:02:24.670> say<00:02:25.090> we

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
going to know the increment just say we

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.630 
going to know the increment just say we
set<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.720> 1<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.170> apply<00:02:26.560> we're<00:02:27.519> gonna

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
set that to 1 in the apply we're gonna

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.479 
set that to 1 in the apply we're gonna
have<00:02:27.940> increments<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.019> our<00:02:29.170> polygon<00:02:29.620> every

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
have increments of our polygon every

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.780 
have increments of our polygon every
keyframe<00:02:31.299> so<00:02:32.220> obviously<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.579> isn't

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
keyframe so obviously that isn't

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.349 
keyframe so obviously that isn't
consistent<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:35.620> we<00:02:36.070> take<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.489> off<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.239> I'm

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
consistent so if we take that off so I'm

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.170 
consistent so if we take that off so I'm
just<00:02:37.570> ctrl<00:02:38.260> Z<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.530> undo<00:02:38.739> that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
just ctrl Z to undo that

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.899 
just ctrl Z to undo that
and<00:02:40.329> take<00:02:40.689> this<00:02:40.780> apply<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.170> down<00:02:41.379> to<00:02:41.620> say<00:02:41.909> 0.1

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
and take this apply it down to say 0.1

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.550 
and take this apply it down to say 0.1
so<00:02:43.450> replicates<00:02:43.989> lots<00:02:44.379> hit<00:02:45.250> apply<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:46.560> there

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
so replicates lots hit apply and there

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.920 
so replicates lots hit apply and there
you<00:02:47.680> go<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.310> looks<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.819> long<00:02:49.120> tube<00:02:49.450> going

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
you go it looks like a long tube going

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.649 
you go it looks like a long tube going
down<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.799> curve<00:02:51.010> now<00:02:51.250> if<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.150> press<00:02:52.390> something

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
down the curve now if I press something

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.170 
down the curve now if I press something
like<00:02:52.900> 5<00:02:53.439> on<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.739> keyboard<00:02:54.189> to<00:02:54.400> switch<00:02:54.549> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
like 5 on the keyboard to switch the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.229 
like 5 on the keyboard to switch the
view<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:56.079> can<00:02:56.260> see<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.189> now<00:02:57.430> when

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
view we can see that that is now when

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.899 
view we can see that that is now when
sort<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.109> very<00:02:59.379> smooth<00:02:59.769> or<00:03:00.189> subdued

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
sort of very smooth or subdued

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.349 
sort of very smooth or subdued
there's<00:03:01.359> a<00:03:01.450> little<00:03:01.750> bit<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:03.430> needs<00:03:03.670> work<00:03:04.000> if

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
there's a little bit that needs work if

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.080 
there's a little bit that needs work if
you<00:03:04.569> go<00:03:04.750> close<00:03:05.079> up<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:06.459> that's<00:03:06.640> something<00:03:07.000> you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
you go close up but that's something you

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.119 
you go close up but that's something you
can<00:03:07.299> work<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.170> increments<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:08.890> so

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
can work on with the increments and so

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.309 
can work on with the increments and so
on<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.519> hope<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.209> enjoyed<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.629> tutorial<00:03:10.810> and
