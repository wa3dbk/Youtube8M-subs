00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello girls I hope you are well 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.260
 Welcome back to my channel the day 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 today I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.660
 simple but beautiful braid that to me 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.810
 love is a fish side braid 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.150
 let's start first let's separate a 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.330
 part of hair here forward so that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.119
 we do not stay so flat after we take 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.239
 a part of hair that once cited what 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.420
 We divide in two and start by catching 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.430
 a small part we cross below 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 and we put it together with the left side 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.290
 now on this side we are going to take a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.489
 small part of the hair we crossed by 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.649
 below putting it together with the right side 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.620
 here we are going to start adding hair 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.190
 to the braid then we pick up a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.039
 tiny division and we add it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.979
 on the other side cross a small part 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.400
 below and we add a division 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.500
 small the braid as we see this fabric 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 It is very easy but it is also very 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.290
 repetitive the braid takes a bit of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.260
 time but I assure you it's worth it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.730
 because in the end it looks beautiful 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:29.070
 we follow then I cross below and 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:31.020
 I add hair to the perfect braid here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.080
 so that we are a little easier 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.980
 then we will bring the hair towards 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.780
 one side we continue adding hair 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.810
 to the braid also 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.470
 and we are going to start adding little by little 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.840
 the hair that we let loose forward and 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.840
 so let's continue weaving the braid 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.700
 ah 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.259
 when we call here more or less to the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.080
 height of the ear I have a little left 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.239
 easier, it's a matter of accommodating 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.150
 hands and see how you guys are also 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.360
 facilitates I'm going to turn around to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.209
 catch the braid from behind and continued 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.230
 with the same tissue I take a part 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.560
 small on the right side very well the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.900
 I cross below 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.060
 I add the hair from the other side 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.709
 and that will make it easier for me 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.870
 hold it so that I do not leave 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.870
 letting go and we continue with the tissue 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.480
 well when we have finished 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.819
 add all the hair already then 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.209
 we can pick up the braid again 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.010
 ahead so it will be easier for us 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.560
 we finished weaving it with the rest of the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:21.220
 hair and in the end we hold it with a 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:23.950
 Elastic bandite at the end of the day 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.549
 then start to pull the braid 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.670
 the sides so that we are wider 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.620
 that is seen with a lot of volume to me 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.690
 I really like this braid that looks 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.629
 always great because it gives you a 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.280
 super nice and natural look then 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.280
 we do it by side and side 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.260
 if the front one had a hair 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.290
 have layers or feel in something that is 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.510
 a little loose do not worry everything 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.849
 We can hold with hooks for the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.000
 hair and there it's going to hold all the 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.000
 day 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.280
 and this is the result of the hairstyle as 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.250
 we see the braid looks beautiful this is 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.769
 one of my favorites serves to make it 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.000
 every day and it is also very comfortable 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.000
 To do exercise 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.220
 but that you liked the video
