00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:19.250
 The Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to Philemon Flm 1: 1 Paul, prisoner of Jesus Christ, and 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 Brother Timothy, beloved Philemon, our collaborator, 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.220
 Flm 1: 2 and the beloved sister Apia, and Archippus our companion in the militia, and the church 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.140
 who is in your house: Flm 1: 3 Grace and peace to you, from our God 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.820
 Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Flm 1: 4 I thank my God, always doing 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.650
 memory of you in my prayers, Phil 1: 5 because I hear of love and faith that 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.900
 you have towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints; 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.700
 Flm 1: 6 so that the participation of your faith is effective in the knowledge of all good 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.450
 that is in you through Christ Jesus. Flm 1: 7 For we have great joy and consolation 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.100
 in your love, because for you, oh brother, the hearts of the saints have been comforted. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 Flm 1: 8 Wherefore, though I have much liberty in Christ to send you what is good, 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.300
 Flm 1: 9 But I pray you for love, being as I am, Paul as an old man, and now, moreover, 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.110
 prisoner of Jesus Christ; Flm 1:10 I pray for my son Onesimus, a 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.050
 whom I begot in my prisons, Phil 1:11 which once was useless to you, 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.610
 but now it is useful for you and me, Phum 1:12 which I send you again; you, then 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.930
 Receive him as myself. Flm 1:13 I would like to keep him with me, for 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.640
 that in your place I would serve in my prisons for the gospel; 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.800
 Flm 1:14 But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your favor would not be as of necessity, 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.640
 but voluntary. Flm 1:15 Because perhaps for this he departed 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.720
 of you for some time, so that you would receive him forever; 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.520
 Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave, but as more than a slave, as a beloved brother, mostly 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.760
 for me, but how much more for you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.830
 Flm 1:17 So, if you have me as a companion, receive him as myself. 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.040
 Flm 1:18 And if it hurt you in any way, or owes you, put it to my account. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.229
 Phm 1:19 I write it from my hand, I will repay it; for not telling you that even yourself 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.090
 You owe me too. Flm 1:20 Yes, brother, may I have some benefit 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.430
 of you in the Lord; comfort my heart in the Lord. 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.670
 Phm 1:21 I have written to you trusting in your obedience, knowing that you will do even more than you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.640
 I say Flm 1:22 Prepare me also lodging; 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.680
 because I hope that by your prayers I will be granted you. 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.310
 Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner, greets you by Christ Jesus, 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.349
 Flm 1:24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my collaborators. 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.270
 Phm 1:25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
