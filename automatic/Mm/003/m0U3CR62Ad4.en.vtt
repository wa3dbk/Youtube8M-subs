discovered<00:00:04.380> on<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.680> mat<00:00:04.830> buried<00:00:05.310> this

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
discovered on the mat buried this

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.610 
discovered on the mat buried this
gameplay<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:06.060> actually<00:00:06.450> from<00:00:06.690> my<00:00:06.870> very<00:00:06.930> first

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
gameplay is actually from my very first

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.860 
gameplay is actually from my very first
buried<00:00:08.069> game<00:00:08.280> i<00:00:08.490> did<00:00:08.880> very<00:00:09.120> well<00:00:09.210> was<00:00:09.570> able<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
buried game i did very well was able to

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.480 
buried game i did very well was able to
make<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.080> all<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.260> way<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.800> round<00:00:11.010> 25

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
make it all the way to about round 25

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.120 
make it all the way to about round 25
until<00:00:12.059> i<00:00:12.090> downed<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> strategy

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
until i downed in this was the strategy

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.460 
until i downed in this was the strategy
that<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.269> fairly<00:00:15.540> simple<00:00:15.839> what

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
that I use it's fairly simple what

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.109 
that I use it's fairly simple what
you're<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> want<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.369> run<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.880> loop

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
you're going to want to do is run a loop

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.300 
you're going to want to do is run a loop
in<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.480> area<00:00:18.900> basically<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.439> big<00:00:19.830> loop<00:00:20.039> around

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
in this area basically a big loop around

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.070 
in this area basically a big loop around
that<00:00:20.789> um<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.270> way<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:21.689> over<00:00:21.930> there<00:00:22.050> I

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that um that way I get over there I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.779 
that um that way I get over there I
believe<00:00:22.199> that's<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> then

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
believe that's what that is and then

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.429 
believe that's what that is and then
this<00:00:23.970> sort<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.300> staircase<00:00:24.810> area<00:00:25.230> right<00:00:25.410> here

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this sort of staircase area right here

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620 
this sort of staircase area right here
now<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.310> may<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.789> John<00:00:27.029> why<00:00:27.240> would<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> run

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
now you may be like John why would I run

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.000 
now you may be like John why would I run
there<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:27.990> fairly<00:00:28.230> crowded<00:00:28.500> i<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.920> get

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
there it's fairly crowded i can get

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
there it's fairly crowded i can get
caught<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.420> wonder

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
caught but if you have this wonder

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.479 
caught but if you have this wonder
weapon<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.320> can't<00:00:31.560> remember<00:00:31.619> its<00:00:32.070> name<00:00:32.130> but

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
weapon I can't remember its name but

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
weapon I can't remember its name but
it's<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.940> handy<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.510> kill<00:00:33.690> zombies<00:00:34.110> because

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
it's very handy to kill zombies because

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.920 
it's very handy to kill zombies because
what<00:00:34.590> it'll<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> stun<00:00:35.940> them<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.660> shoot

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
what it'll do is stun them if you shoot

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.150 
what it'll do is stun them if you shoot
it<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.200> front<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.500> them<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.680> then<00:00:37.950> they<00:00:38.040> won't

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
it in front of them and then they won't

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.830 
it in front of them and then they won't
move<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.030> sort<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.360> maneuver<00:00:39.600> around

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
move and you can sort of maneuver around

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
move and you can sort of maneuver around
them<00:00:40.260> almost<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.430> were<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> freeze

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
them almost as if you were to a freeze

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.420 
them almost as if you were to a freeze
frozen<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.860> sort<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.250> moved

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
frozen time and just sort of like moved

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
frozen time and just sort of like moved
around<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.210> unfrozen<00:00:45.750> time<00:00:46.110> once

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
around them and then unfrozen time once

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.139 
around them and then unfrozen time once
you<00:00:46.530> stop<00:00:46.770> pulling<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> trigger<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> as

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you stop pulling the trigger and as

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
you stop pulling the trigger and as
you'll<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.660> also<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.320> useful<00:00:49.469> for

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you'll see it's also very useful for

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.250 
you'll see it's also very useful for
killing<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> zombies<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.780> wanted<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
killing the zombies so if you wanted you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
killing the zombies so if you wanted you
could<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.680> use<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.309> strategy<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
could actually use the strategy all the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.470 
could actually use the strategy all the
way<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.719> say<00:00:55.050> round<00:00:55.379> 1<00:00:55.620> billion<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.940> using

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
way up to say round 1 billion just using

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
way up to say round 1 billion just using
this<00:00:57.570> weapon<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.530> weapon<00:00:59.010> has

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
this weapon because this weapon has

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
this weapon because this weapon has
unlimited<00:01:00.149> ammo<00:01:00.539> essentially<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> way<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
unlimited ammo essentially the way it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
unlimited ammo essentially the way it
works<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.890> very<00:01:01.980> similar<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.850> jet<00:01:03.329> gun

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
works is very similar to the jet gun

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
works is very similar to the jet gun
where<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.890> day<00:01:05.159> gym<00:01:05.460> once<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.880> cage

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
where you have a day gym once I cage

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
where you have a day gym once I cage
fills<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.320> can't<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.220> unlike<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
fills up you can't use it but unlike the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.179 
fills up you can't use it but unlike the
jet<00:01:09.000> gun<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.420> does<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.960> break<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.010> cools

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
jet gun it does not break and it cools

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.580 
jet gun it does not break and it cools
down<00:01:11.490> fairly<00:01:11.880> quickly<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:13.200> off<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
down fairly quickly so first off you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
down fairly quickly so first off you
don't<00:01:13.619> even<00:01:14.010> need<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.580> fill<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> gauge<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.270> can

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
don't even need to fill the gauge I can

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
don't even need to fill the gauge I can
kill<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> whole<00:01:15.869> horde<00:01:16.170> which<00:01:16.380> may<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.530> like

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
kill a whole horde which may be like

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
kill a whole horde which may be like
one-fourth<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.610> gauge<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.689> by<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
one-fourth of my gauge and then by the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109 
one-fourth of my gauge and then by the
time<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.500> next<00:01:19.619> towards<00:01:19.979> their<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.549> gun<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
time the next towards their my gun is

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
time the next towards their my gun is
practically<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.960> zero<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.040> kill<00:01:23.280> as

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
practically at zero and I can kill as

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
practically at zero and I can kill as
many<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.850> want<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.810> takes<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.439> 30

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
many as I want and it takes like 30

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
many as I want and it takes like 30
seconds<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.490> guns<00:01:26.759> gauge<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.420> fill<00:01:27.630> up

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
seconds for your guns gauge to fill up
