00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:19.550
 hello good today we are going to make a drawing 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.550
 simple of a spaceship 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.869
 let's draw a dome as well 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.230
 the cabin and from there we will be doing 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.230
 this 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.820
 Now let's do it like this 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.590
 and to come again up there and from 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:45.310
 here we will be doing the rest of the ship 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.660
 from here we will do like this 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.660
 up here 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.350
 let's draw a wing of a line it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350
 curve 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.370
 let's draw from here this part 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.000
 yes economy out there 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:10.200
 from here - we will take do so 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.460
 here we will go up a little 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 and we will do this way 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 it will be one of the engines 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.460
 but we'll make another curve around here 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 let's look 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.020
 and we will make another of the engines 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.970
 A) Yes 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.100
 we draw it 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.939
 it is more a curve more 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.939
 a straight 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.810
 and we do it in part 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.810
 we see like this 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.940
 now let's decorate it for example 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.479
 let's do a couple of lines if the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.479
 go through 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.920
 and all equally well online that 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.920
 they will cross in half 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.180
 something like that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.370
 and well let's put it to be a 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.060
 racing ship so we put him then the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.780
 number that we like 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.780
 24 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.740
 24 and that's how easy it would be to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.850
 spaceship with this design 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.430
 but you liked that you do it the same 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.780
 of facilitating you and we would see each other 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.780
 in my next video
