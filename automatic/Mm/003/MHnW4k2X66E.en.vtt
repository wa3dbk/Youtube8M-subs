00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.400 
was a lot smoother you know the main he
did<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.880> was<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> lot<00:02:46.420> smoother<00:02:46.959> didn't<00:02:47.290> look

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
did it was a lot smoother didn't look

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.770 
did it was a lot smoother didn't look
too<00:02:48.070> glitchy<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:48.970> could<00:02:49.120> look<00:02:49.270> sometimes

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
too glitchy like it could look sometimes

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.259 
too glitchy like it could look sometimes
on<00:02:50.019> battlefield<00:02:50.620> 3<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.700> seems<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.120> in

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
on battlefield 3 like it seems like in

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.820 
on battlefield 3 like it seems like in
battlefield<00:02:52.750> 3<00:02:52.840> when<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.230> go<00:02:53.380> for<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.620> knife

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
battlefield 3 when you go for the knife

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.610 
battlefield 3 when you go for the knife
kill<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:55.209> know<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.450> frames<00:02:55.750> drop<00:02:56.200> or<00:02:56.440> some

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
kill it you know the frames drop or some

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.170 
kill it you know the frames drop or some
shit<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.010> but<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.519> seemed<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.970> lot

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
shit like that but this seemed a lot

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.630 
shit like that but this seemed a lot
smoother<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.930> kind<00:02:59.769> of<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> truck<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.489> they

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
smoother and kind of the truck that they

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.699 
smoother and kind of the truck that they
was<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.450> Jeep<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.750> y'all<00:03:02.170> be<00:03:02.320> seeing<00:03:02.560> in

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
was in the Jeep that y'all be seeing in

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.740 
was in the Jeep that y'all be seeing in
multiplayer<00:03:03.130> on<00:03:03.310> battlefield<00:03:03.820> 3<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.480> looked

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
multiplayer on battlefield 3 it looked

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.540 
multiplayer on battlefield 3 it looked
very<00:03:04.840> similar<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.980> jeeps<00:03:06.370> and

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
very similar to the jeeps and

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.420 
very similar to the jeeps and
battlefield<00:03:07.120> 3<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:09.070> know<00:03:09.160> that's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
battlefield 3 but you know that's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.860 
battlefield 3 but you know that's

didn't really get to show off too much
of<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.510> destruction<00:03:19.510> four<00:03:19.780> point<00:03:20.079> oh<00:03:20.290> you

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
an upgrade is in order now I can either

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.310 
an upgrade is in order now I can either
go<00:03:51.870> another<00:03:52.870> 680<00:03:53.620> which<00:03:54.459> would<00:03:54.700> be<00:03:55.019> great<00:03:56.019> but

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
go another 680 which would be great but

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.100 
go another 680 which would be great but
the<00:03:56.680> thing<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:56.920> if<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.400> go<00:03:57.579> with<00:03:58.000> another<00:03:58.239> 680<00:03:58.840> I

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
the thing is if I go with another 680 I

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.380 
the thing is if I go with another 680 I
have<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.650> bite<00:03:59.829> of<00:04:00.010> 680<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.700> have<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.329> new

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
have to bite of 680 I have to get a new

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.270 
have to bite of 680 I have to get a new
other<00:04:01.780> board<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.560> have<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.890> get<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.250> new

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
other board and I have to get a new

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.569 
other board and I have to get a new
power<00:04:04.060> supply<00:04:04.420> if<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.410> go<00:04:05.590> with<00:04:05.620> another<00:04:05.950> 680

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
power supply if I go with another 680

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.349 
power supply if I go with another 680
black<00:04:07.739> when<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.769> add<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.160> all<00:04:09.310> up<00:04:09.340> cuzzo<00:04:09.970> yeah<00:04:10.150> I

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
black when I add it all up cuzzo yeah I

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.849 
black when I add it all up cuzzo yeah I
didn't<00:04:10.540> get<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.720> mac<00:04:10.900> oh<00:04:11.170> yeah<00:04:11.530> I've<00:04:11.709> been

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
didn't get the mac oh yeah I've been

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.979 
didn't get the mac oh yeah I've been
doing<00:04:12.070> in<00:04:12.220> math<00:04:12.400> when<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.030> add<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.390> all<00:04:13.510> up<00:04:13.540> it

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
doing in math when I add it all up it

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.440 
doing in math when I add it all up it
still<00:04:14.260> comes<00:04:14.560> out<00:04:14.799> cheaper<00:04:14.829> if<00:04:15.609> I<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.209> go

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
still comes out cheaper if I just go

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.360 
still comes out cheaper if I just go
with<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:17.310> GTX<00:04:18.310> Titan<00:04:18.579> or<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.769> 690<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.190> all

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
with a GTX Titan or a 690 and if you all

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.790 
with a GTX Titan or a 690 and if you all
know<00:04:21.599> 26<00:04:22.599> 80s<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.260> more<00:04:23.530> powerful<00:04:23.800> than

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
know 26 80s is more powerful than

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.589 
know 26 80s is more powerful than
titan<00:04:25.129> and<00:04:25.509> to<00:04:26.509> 680<00:04:27.020> is<00:04:27.500> slightly<00:04:28.129> more

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
titan and to 680 is slightly more

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.809 
titan and to 680 is slightly more
powerful<00:04:29.599> than<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.139> 690<00:04:30.860> especially<00:04:31.550> if<00:04:31.669> i

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 
powerful than the 690 especially if i

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.749 
powerful than the 690 especially if i
overclock<00:04:32.509> the<00:04:32.539> 268<00:04:33.440> is<00:04:33.620> it'll<00:04:33.860> be<00:04:33.889> a<00:04:34.220> lot<00:04:34.699> more

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
overclock the 268 is it'll be a lot more

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.399 
overclock the 268 is it'll be a lot more
powerful<00:04:35.419> than<00:04:35.690> a<00:04:35.750> 1<00:04:36.259> 690<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.789> an<00:04:38.090> upgrade<00:04:39.050> is

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409
