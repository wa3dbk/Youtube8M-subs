Meyer and here's a look at the package

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.439 
Meyer and here's a look at the package
it's<00:00:47.040> really<00:00:47.309> quick<00:00:47.519> and<00:00:50.180> as<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.269> can<00:00:51.390> tell

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it's really quick and as you can tell

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's really quick and as you can tell
when<00:00:52.440> looking<00:00:53.159> at<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.339> package<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.320> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
when looking at the package here that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.369 
when looking at the package here that
the<00:00:55.500> drive<00:00:55.769> is<00:00:56.489> actually<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.479> little<00:00:58.049> kind<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the drive is actually a little kind of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.009 
the drive is actually a little kind of
hard<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.860> from<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.479> the<00:01:00.479> drive<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
hard to see from here but the drive is

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.340 
hard to see from here but the drive is
pretty<00:01:01.440> small<00:01:01.830> compared<00:01:02.339> to<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.640> actual<00:01:03.059> box

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
pretty small compared to the actual box

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.539 
pretty small compared to the actual box
that<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.739> put<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:06.710> now<00:01:07.710> included<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.340> this

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that they put it in now included in this

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.180 
that they put it in now included in this
box<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.049> drive<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:12.119> DVD

itself<00:01:17.210> as<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.510> can<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.049> pretty<00:01:19.470> thin

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
itself as you can see it's pretty thin

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.240 
itself as you can see it's pretty thin
compared<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> box<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:22.039> so<00:01:23.039> you<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
compared to the box here so you know and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:46.099 
compared to the box here so you know and
you<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:39.859> USB<00:01:40.859> cable<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:44.630> now<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> USB

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
you also have USB cable here now the USB

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.580 
you also have USB cable here now the USB
cable<00:01:46.799> included<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.549> Drive<00:01:47.999> is<00:01:48.590> what

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
cable included with this Drive is what

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.149 
cable included with this Drive is what
they<00:01:49.740> call<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> USB<00:01:50.909> Y<00:01:51.179> cable<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.890> reason

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
they call a USB Y cable and the reason

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.660 
they call a USB Y cable and the reason
why<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.490> called<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.780> because<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:56.520> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
why it's called that is because this is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
why it's called that is because this is
the<00:01:56.820> end<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.060> plug<00:01:57.329> into<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> computer<00:01:57.780> or

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the end you plug into the computer or

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.340 
the end you plug into the computer or
into<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> drive<00:01:59.429> actually<00:01:59.990> back<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
into the drive actually back of the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.580 
into the drive actually back of the
drive<00:02:01.679> here<00:02:02.359> then<00:02:03.359> there's<00:02:03.659> two<00:02:03.899> regular<00:02:04.319> USB

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
drive here then there's two regular USB

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.459 
drive here then there's two regular USB
connectors<00:02:05.630> they<00:02:06.630> look<00:02:06.749> like<00:02:06.840> regular<00:02:07.020> USB

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
connectors they look like regular USB

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.290 
connectors they look like regular USB
connectors<00:02:08.240> one<00:02:09.240> for<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.740> power<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
connectors one for just power and the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.559 
connectors one for just power and the
other<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.720> power<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.860> data<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.390> if

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
other one is power and for data so if

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.330 
other one is power and for data so if
you're<00:02:16.880> on<00:02:17.880> some<00:02:18.210> computers<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.220> have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you're on some computers if you have

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.430 
you're on some computers if you have
enough<00:02:20.550> power<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.180> USB<00:02:21.450> port<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.290> can

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
enough power in one USB port you can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.770 
enough power in one USB port you can
just<00:02:22.650> use<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.880> don't<00:02:24.660> have

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
just use the one but if you don't have

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.430 
just use the one but if you don't have
enough<00:02:24.990> power

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
enough power

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.020 
enough power
now<00:02:26.650> when<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.220> use<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.520> other<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
now when you have to use the other the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.510 
now when you have to use the other the
second<00:02:28.420> one<00:02:28.570> too<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.680> gives<00:02:29.890> extra<00:02:30.340> power

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
second one too so that gives extra power

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.270 
second one too so that gives extra power
if<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.940> need<00:02:31.150> it

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
if you need it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.790 
if you need it
so<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.340> don't<00:02:33.580> have<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.820> have<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> plug-in<00:02:34.300> like

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
so you don't have to have a plug-in like

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.500 
so you don't have to have a plug-in like
a<00:02:35.800> regular<00:02:36.010> power<00:02:36.340> supply<00:02:36.820> but<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.270> thing

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
a regular power supply but this thing

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.410 
a regular power supply but this thing
does<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.960> an<00:02:38.410> option<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.250> power<00:02:39.520> port

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
does have an option for a power port

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.450 
does have an option for a power port
here<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.080> plug<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.440> power<00:02:41.830> or<00:02:42.160> regular

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
here we can plug in power or regular

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.600 
here we can plug in power or regular
power<00:02:42.640> supply<00:02:43.320> but<00:02:44.320> doesn't<00:02:44.650> say<00:02:45.130> word<00:02:45.400> of

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
power supply but doesn't say word of

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.660 
power supply but doesn't say word of
what<00:02:46.140> has<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.320> voltage<00:02:47.740> written<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.160> here<00:02:48.460> but

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
what has the voltage written on here but

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.800 
what has the voltage written on here but
I<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.990> no<00:02:50.230> clue<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.540> pretty

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
I have no clue you have to be pretty

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.930 
I have no clue you have to be pretty
knowledgeable<00:02:53.080> about<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:53.980> or<00:02:54.370> about<00:02:54.670> power

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
knowledgeable about like or about power

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.090 
knowledgeable about like or about power
didn't<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.510> which<00:02:55.660> one<00:02:55.900> fits<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.380> there<00:02:59.100> and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
didn't know which one fits in there and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.740 
didn't know which one fits in there and
then<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.970> course<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.330> part<00:03:01.570> where

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
then this is of course the part where

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.080 
then this is of course the part where
the<00:03:01.930> USB<00:03:02.440> cable<00:03:02.620> goes<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.070> right<00:03:03.490> there<00:03:03.790> next

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
the USB cable goes in right there next

they're<00:03:15.550> required<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:17.350> works<00:03:17.590> with

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
they're required and that works with

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.120 
they're required and that works with
Linux<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:19.050> Ubuntu<00:03:20.050> whatever<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:23.130> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.610

doesn't<00:03:24.340> say<00:03:24.580> Windows<00:03:24.880> 7<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.420> box<00:03:25.690> but<00:03:26.560> I

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
doesn't say Windows 7 on the box but I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.300 
doesn't say Windows 7 on the box but I
noticed<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.370> stuff<00:03:28.000> included<00:03:28.480> inside

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
noticed on the stuff included inside

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.560 
noticed on the stuff included inside
that<00:03:30.310> does<00:03:31.060> say<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:32.050> supports<00:03:32.530> Windows<00:03:32.860> 7

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
that does say that it supports Windows 7

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.210 
that does say that it supports Windows 7
and<00:03:34.570> that's<00:03:34.870> compatible<00:03:35.230> windows<00:03:35.709> 7<00:03:36.040> so

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
and that's compatible windows 7 so

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.710 
and that's compatible windows 7 so
apparently<00:03:36.610> they<00:03:38.160> created<00:03:39.160> new<00:03:39.420> papers<00:03:40.420> and

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
apparently they created new papers and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.420 
apparently they created new papers and
this<00:03:41.080> for<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> because<00:03:41.830> in<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:43.300> same<00:03:43.510> boxes<00:03:44.430> so

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
this for it because in the same boxes so

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.130 
this for it because in the same boxes so
this<00:03:45.580> will<00:03:45.760> work<00:03:45.940> with<00:03:46.090> Windows<00:03:46.420> 7<00:03:46.600> despite

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
this will work with Windows 7 despite

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.760 
this will work with Windows 7 despite

on<00:04:58.130> my<00:04:58.280> computer<00:04:58.870> for<00:04:59.870> me<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.080> only<00:05:00.380> had<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.680> use

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
on my computer for me I only had to use

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.220 
on my computer for me I only had to use
one<00:05:01.040> for<00:05:01.070> both<00:05:01.880> power<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.300> data<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:02.900> didn't

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
one for both power and data I didn't

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.490 
one for both power and data I didn't
need<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:03.380> there<00:05:03.680> power<00:05:03.890> one<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.750> as<00:05:06.200> you<00:05:06.350> can

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
need that there power one and as you can

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.450 
need that there power one and as you can
see<00:05:06.680> here<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:08.480> says<00:05:08.750> that's<00:05:09.170> ready<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.650> use<00:05:09.950> and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
see here it says that's ready to use and

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
see here it says that's ready to use and
that's<00:05:10.640> been<00:05:10.910> successfully<00:05:11.660> installed<00:05:13.480> so

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
that's been successfully installed so

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.830 
that's been successfully installed so
you<00:05:14.960> don't<00:05:15.530> need<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.950> include<00:05:16.520> or<00:05:16.970> put<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.600> CD

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
you don't need to include or put the CD

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.550 
you don't need to include or put the CD
and<00:05:18.140> probably<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:19.300> use<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.600> that's<00:05:21.290> just

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
and probably to use it that's just

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.380 
and probably to use it that's just
software<00:05:21.980> in<00:05:22.250> case<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.550> don't<00:05:22.670> have<00:05:22.790> software

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
to run play videos and copying discs and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.790 
to run play videos and copying discs and
stuff<00:05:27.160> but<00:05:28.160> instructions<00:05:29.150> do<00:05:29.450> have<00:05:31.120> their<00:05:32.120> the

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
stuff but instructions do have their the

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.900 
stuff but instructions do have their the
thing<00:05:33.800> here<00:05:34.160> does<00:05:34.700> say<00:05:35.390> how<00:05:35.630> they<00:05:36.760> use<00:05:37.760> the

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
thing here does say how they use the

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.400 
thing here does say how they use the
software<00:05:38.420> if<00:05:38.540> you<00:05:38.570> want<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.900> use<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.170> software

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.560 

in<00:05:42.410> order<00:05:42.650> to<00:05:42.860> put<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.550> disc<00:05:43.880> in<00:05:44.120> here<00:05:44.390> and<00:05:44.510> you

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
in order to put a disc in here and you

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.540 
in order to put a disc in here and you
just<00:05:44.600> push<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.350> button<00:05:45.380> here<00:05:46.040> and<00:05:46.160> open<00:05:46.520> up

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
just push the button here and open up

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.200 
just push the button here and open up
the<00:05:46.760> tray<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.740> pull<00:05:49.160> it<00:05:49.280> out<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.430> guess<00:05:49.850> and

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
the tray and pull it out I guess and

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.020 
the tray and pull it out I guess and
then<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.570> put<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:50.870> disc<00:05:51.080> in<00:05:51.790> then<00:05:52.790> you<00:05:52.850> want

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
then you put the disc in then you want
