00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
wins we will go to the criteria to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.000 
wins we will go to the criteria to
determine<00:00:47.510> who<00:00:47.900> has<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.080> most<00:00:48.350> points<00:00:48.650> in<00:00:48.920> the

determine who has the most points in the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.850 
determine who has the most points in the
pool<00:00:49.239> so<00:00:50.239> this<00:00:50.390> is<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.570> round-robin<00:00:50.960> match<00:00:51.530> this

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
pool so this is a round-robin match this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.299 
pool so this is a round-robin match this
is<00:00:51.979> the<00:00:52.040> last<00:00:52.250> one<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.580> determine<00:00:53.120> placement

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.760 

three<00:00:59.969> two<00:01:00.239> threes<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.930> Marino<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.530> should

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
three two threes for Marino that should

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.020 
three two threes for Marino that should
end<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> period<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.430> does

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
end the period it does

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.260 
end the period it does
nice<00:01:03.420> arm<00:01:03.690> throw<00:01:03.930> attempt

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.240 

but<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.990> way<00:01:15.140> I'm<00:01:15.290> looking<00:01:15.530> at<00:01:15.829> this<00:01:15.979> right

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
but the way I'm looking at this right

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.859 
but the way I'm looking at this right
now<00:01:16.280> this<00:01:16.670> should<00:01:16.909> be<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.509> round<00:01:17.720> robin

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
now this should be a it's a round robin

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.510 
now this should be a it's a round robin
but<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:19.759> final<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.250> both<00:01:22.250> these

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
but this is the final so both these

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.270 
but this is the final so both these
wrestlers<00:01:23.170> didn't<00:01:24.170> have<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.290> loss<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.159> way

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
wrestlers didn't have a loss so the way

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.190 
wrestlers didn't have a loss so the way
I<00:01:25.310> understand<00:01:25.909> it<00:01:26.030> who<00:01:26.570> wins<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.960> match

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
I understand it who wins this match

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.779 
I understand it who wins this match
should<00:01:27.229> be<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.710> champion<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.369> is<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.520> true

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
should be the champion so it is a true

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.859 
should be the champion so it is a true
champion<00:01:29.149> match<00:01:30.700> if<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:31.970> believe<00:01:32.450> I'm<00:01:32.630> probably

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
champion match if I believe I'm probably

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.590 
champion match if I believe I'm probably
