terms<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.030> scrolling<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.600> thought<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.080> would<00:01:25.229> be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
terms of scrolling I thought it would be

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
terms of scrolling I thought it would be
longer<00:01:25.680> hopefully<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.700> make<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> button

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
longer hopefully they make a button

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.050 
longer hopefully they make a button
where<00:01:27.930> you're<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.290> zoom<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.610> goes<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
where you're like zoom it goes to the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.480 
where you're like zoom it goes to the
other<00:01:30.150> side<00:01:30.409> but<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.740> don't<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.310> they're

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
other side but I don't think they're

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
other side but I don't think they're
doing<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.880> anytime<00:01:33.180> soon<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:33.960> they

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
doing that anytime soon because they

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
doing that anytime soon because they
didn't<00:01:34.380> even<00:01:34.439> fix<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> habitat<00:01:35.460> our<00:01:35.640> habitats

sell these eggs I actually have not had
the<00:02:00.570> glitch<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.380> hopefully<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.920> fix<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the glitch so hopefully they fix it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
the glitch so hopefully they fix it
hopefully<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.570> try<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> mention

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
hopefully they see it I try to mention

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.859 
hopefully they see it I try to mention
it<00:02:04.530> whenever<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.549> device<00:02:06.000> but

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it whenever I'm on this device but

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.550 
it whenever I'm on this device but
they're<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.740> doing<00:02:08.190> anything<00:02:08.489> about<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.849> I

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
they're not doing anything about it I

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
they're not doing anything about it I
think<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.679> been<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:10.950> half<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.000> year<00:02:12.239> already

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
think it's been like half a year already

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.460 
think it's been like half a year already
so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.030 
so
they<00:02:13.740> do<00:02:13.970> get<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.660> fix<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.530> maybe<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.800> should

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
they do get it and fix it maybe I should

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.310 
they do get it and fix it maybe I should
give<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> personal<00:02:17.790> email<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.420> sure<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:19.050> I
