00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
he has this one that's also used as a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100 
he has this one that's also used as a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
explosion this thing is also a linker

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.410 
explosion this thing is also a linker
but<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.890> has<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> fake-out<00:02:23.849> one<00:02:24.120> which<00:02:24.269> is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
but it has a fake-out one which is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.059 
but it has a fake-out one which is
really<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:24.930> throw<00:02:25.260> setups<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.739> well<00:02:25.950> as

really good for throw setups as well as

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.740 
really good for throw setups as well as
the<00:02:26.160> e^x<00:02:26.519> version<00:02:26.849> which<00:02:26.940> does<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.300> heck<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.660> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the e^x version which does a heck of a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.300 
the e^x version which does a heck of a
lot<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.989> chip<00:02:28.140> damage<00:02:28.349> there's<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.040> really

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
lot of chip damage there's a really

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.130 
lot of chip damage there's a really
unique<00:02:29.459> mechanic<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.390> cinder<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:30.959> that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
unique mechanic to cinder and it's that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.199 
unique mechanic to cinder and it's that
he<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.410> actually<00:02:31.920> light<00:02:32.220> your<00:02:32.400> limbs<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.910> fire

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
he can actually light your limbs on fire

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.869 
he can actually light your limbs on fire
with<00:02:33.840> specific<00:02:34.470> Enders<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.099> then<00:02:35.459> find<00:02:35.760> out

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
with specific Enders and then find out

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.059 
with specific Enders and then find out
make<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> lot<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> sense<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.470> pretty<00:02:37.769> cool

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
make a lot of sense but it's pretty cool

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.130 
make a lot of sense but it's pretty cool
because<00:02:38.340> at<00:02:38.670> any<00:02:38.760> point<00:02:38.879> he<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.690> actually<00:02:39.840> end

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
because at any point he can actually end

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.440 
because at any point he can actually end
the<00:02:40.290> combo<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.830> not<00:02:41.010> do<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> lot<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.519> damage<00:02:41.970> but

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the combo and not do a lot of damage but

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.320 
the combo and not do a lot of damage but
light<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:43.019> legs<00:02:43.349> or<00:02:43.769> your<00:02:43.799> arms<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.640> fire<00:02:45.030> and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
light your legs or your arms on fire and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.720 
light your legs or your arms on fire and
what<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.870> does<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.440> causes<00:02:47.010> potential

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
what this does is causes potential

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.539 
what this does is causes potential
damage<00:02:48.120> over<00:02:48.840> time<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.860> there's<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> big<00:02:50.250> kind

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
damage over time and there's a big kind

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.890 
damage over time and there's a big kind
of<00:02:50.640> mechanic<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.510> look<00:02:51.720> out<00:02:51.870> for

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
of mechanic you have to look out for

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.150 
of mechanic you have to look out for
when<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.290> fighting<00:02:52.620> against<00:02:52.829> cinder

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
when you're fighting against cinder

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
you actually fan the flames which makes

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.339 
you actually fan the flames which makes
them<00:02:59.519> bigger<00:02:59.849> on<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.420> character<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.019> you

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
them bigger on your character and you

this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.629> not<00:03:03.780> doing<00:03:04.079> actual<00:03:04.709> damage<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.489> is

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
this is not doing actual damage this is

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.580 
this is not doing actual damage this is
doing<00:03:05.910> damage<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.989> potentially

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
doing damage that you can potentially

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.800 
doing damage that you can potentially
cash<00:03:07.829> out<00:03:08.069> if<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.459> land<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.849> combo<00:03:09.239> but<00:03:09.720> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
cash out if you land a combo but it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.690 
cash out if you land a combo but it
actually<00:03:10.140> goes<00:03:10.319> away<00:03:10.530> fairly<00:03:10.799> fast<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.610> you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
actually goes away fairly fast if you

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.190 
actually goes away fairly fast if you
just<00:03:11.879> don't<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.239> anything<00:03:12.629> it's<00:03:12.750> gone<00:03:12.900> within

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
just don't do anything it's gone within

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.110 
just don't do anything it's gone within
a<00:03:13.260> couple<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.650> seconds<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.970> very

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
a couple of seconds so it's a very

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.520 
a couple of seconds so it's a very
interesting<00:03:15.299> setup<00:03:15.660> mechanic<00:03:16.170> with<00:03:16.290> them<00:03:16.410> as

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
interesting setup mechanic with them as

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.590 
interesting setup mechanic with them as
well<00:03:16.739> cinder<00:03:17.310> also<00:03:17.639> has<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.030> burn<00:03:18.450> up

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
well cinder also has this burn up

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.840 
well cinder also has this burn up
ability<00:03:19.049> or<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.500> kind<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.829> like<00:03:20.040> flame<00:03:20.609> on

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
couple of seconds he'll just kind of

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.809 
couple of seconds he'll just kind of
like<00:03:28.079> whoosh<00:03:28.380> into<00:03:28.739> fire<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.639> gives

special in the air it looks just like

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.880 
special in the air it looks just like
classic<00:04:21.419> killer<00:04:21.630> instinct<00:04:22.049> type<00:04:22.260> stuff<00:04:22.530> he

classic killer instinct type stuff he

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.409 
classic killer instinct type stuff he
does<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.219> a<00:04:23.250> recapture<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.969> looks<00:04:24.150> pretty

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
does have a recapture it looks pretty

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.310 
does have a recapture it looks pretty
easy<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.750> use

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
easy to use

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.870 
easy to use
and<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:25.800> bring<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:25.950> back<00:04:26.130> down<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.670> kind

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
and you can bring it back down and kind

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.520 
and you can bring it back down and kind
of<00:04:26.940> launch<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.330> back<00:04:27.510> up<00:04:27.720> at<00:04:27.840> any<00:04:28.020> given<00:04:28.260> time

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
of launch you back up at any given time

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.620 
of launch you back up at any given time
of<00:04:28.770> course<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.550> isn't<00:04:29.730> like<00:04:29.940> season<00:04:30.270> 1<00:04:30.420> all

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
of course this isn't like season 1 all

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.720 
of course this isn't like season 1 all
this<00:04:30.780> stuff<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.230> indeed<00:04:31.770> breakable<00:04:32.310> so

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
this stuff is indeed breakable so

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.190 
this stuff is indeed breakable so
there's<00:04:33.030> going<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.180> be<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.360> huge<00:04:33.600> mind<00:04:33.960> game

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
there's going to be that huge mind game

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.630 
there's going to be that huge mind game
of<00:04:34.440> are<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.680> gonna<00:04:34.800> do<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.100> recapture

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
of are you gonna do the recapture

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.760 
of are you gonna do the recapture
because<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.880> know<00:04:35.940> what<00:04:36.390> recapture<00:04:37.050> button<00:04:37.380> is

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
because I know what recapture button is

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.740 
because I know what recapture button is
and<00:04:38.070> that'd<00:04:38.460> be<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.610> very<00:04:38.700> easy<00:04:38.940> part<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.630> to

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
and that'd be a very easy part of it to

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.510 
and that'd be a very easy part of it to
break<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.740> thing<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:40.950> can<00:04:41.130> kind<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.370> take

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
break so the thing that can kind of take

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.160 
break so the thing that can kind of take
away<00:04:41.550> from<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.300> especially<00:04:42.480> that<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:42.900> did

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
away from this and especially that I did

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.170 
away from this and especially that I did
when<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.470> see<00:04:43.650> cinder<00:04:44.100> finally<00:04:44.610> in<00:04:44.790> gameplay

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
when you see cinder finally in gameplay

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.930 
when you see cinder finally in gameplay
and<00:04:45.740> executing<00:04:46.740> actions<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.310> motions<00:04:47.730> and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and executing actions and motions and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.370 
and executing actions and motions and
regardless<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:48.570> what<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.810> kind<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.170> think

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
regardless of what you kind of think

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.380 
regardless of what you kind of think
about<00:04:49.440> his<00:04:49.710> design<00:04:50.070> or<00:04:50.280> look<00:04:50.460> because<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:51.060> lot

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
about his design or look because a lot

about his design or look because a lot
of<00:04:51.420> people<00:04:51.660> do<00:04:51.780> like<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.110> way<00:04:52.200> he<00:04:52.350> looks<00:04:52.590> quite

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
of people do like the way he looks quite

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.020 
of people do like the way he looks quite
a<00:04:52.920> bit<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.310> some<00:04:53.430> people<00:04:53.640> are<00:04:53.730> pretty<00:04:53.850> upset

a bit and some people are pretty upset

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.730 
a bit and some people are pretty upset
about<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.540> way<00:04:54.630> he<00:04:54.810> looks<00:04:55.020> because<00:04:55.350> it's<00:04:55.560> not

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
about the way he looks because it's not

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.740 
about the way he looks because it's not

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
kind of the classic sender all I'll say

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.600 
kind of the classic sender all I'll say
is<00:04:57.780> wait<00:04:58.110> for<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.410> classic<00:04:58.800> sender<00:04:59.100> costume

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
guys they'll show it eventually and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.050 
guys they'll show it eventually and
it'll<00:05:01.620> probably<00:05:01.770> make<00:05:02.070> everyone<00:05:02.400> very<00:05:02.430> happy

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060

but I'm really happy that cinder

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.740 
but I'm really happy that cinder
gameplay-wise<00:05:05.460> looks<00:05:06.030> really<00:05:06.480> interesting

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
gameplay-wise looks really interesting

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.640 
gameplay-wise looks really interesting
if<00:05:07.260> not<00:05:07.730> extremely<00:05:08.730> good<00:05:09.210> he<00:05:09.540> also<00:05:09.810> has<00:05:10.260> the

kind<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.920> thing<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.130> is<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.490> tipping<00:05:11.820> point

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
kind of thing that is the tipping point

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.970 
kind of thing that is the tipping point
for<00:05:12.150> me<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.510> makes<00:05:12.660> him<00:05:12.840> look<00:05:12.990> really<00:05:13.770> good

at any time and cinder has the ability
to<00:05:22.530> control<00:05:23.010> these<00:05:23.160> fireballs<00:05:23.460> by<00:05:23.850> detonating

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
to control these fireballs by detonating

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.300 
to control these fireballs by detonating
them<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.200> can<00:05:25.350> detonate<00:05:25.560> them<00:05:25.890> as<00:05:26.070> long

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
them and you can detonate them as long

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.770 
them and you can detonate them as long

as they're on the screen at any point
you<00:05:28.200> can't<00:05:28.440> even<00:05:28.620> block<00:05:29.130> them<00:05:29.400> really<00:05:29.790> if<00:05:29.940> you

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
you can't even block them really if you

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.490 
you can't even block them really if you
block<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:30.600> he<00:05:30.660> throws<00:05:30.900> one<00:05:31.080> at<00:05:31.230> you<00:05:31.380> it

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
block and he throws one at you it

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.110 
block and he throws one at you it
actually<00:05:31.770> gets<00:05:31.950> stuck<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.700> doesn't<00:05:33.030> do

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
actually gets stuck to you it doesn't do

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.240 
actually gets stuck to you it doesn't do
any<00:05:33.300> damage<00:05:33.390> but<00:05:34.170> you<00:05:34.290> can<00:05:34.530> detonate<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.130> at

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
any damage but you can detonate it at

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.680 
any damage but you can detonate it at
any<00:05:35.370> point<00:05:35.700> which<00:05:35.850> gives<00:05:36.000> cinder<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.360> lot<00:05:36.570> of

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
any point which gives cinder a lot of

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.780 
any point which gives cinder a lot of
control<00:05:37.170> so<00:05:37.740> we'll<00:05:37.890> see<00:05:38.010> how<00:05:38.160> good<00:05:38.340> this<00:05:38.520> move

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
control so we'll see how good this move

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.610 
control so we'll see how good this move
ends<00:05:39.150> up<00:05:39.270> being<00:05:39.510> because<00:05:39.840> right<00:05:40.110> now<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.440> looks

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
what they're doing it there's a lot of

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.180 
what they're doing it there's a lot of
callback<00:07:04.840> stuff<00:07:05.110> including<00:07:05.620> his<00:07:05.770> wind<00:07:05.980> pose

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.690

kind of the coolest about the character

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.720 
kind of the coolest about the character
is<00:07:11.230> that<00:07:11.350> the<00:07:11.470> mask<00:07:11.710> that's<00:07:11.980> on<00:07:12.190> cinder<00:07:12.610> is

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
is that the mask that's on cinder is
