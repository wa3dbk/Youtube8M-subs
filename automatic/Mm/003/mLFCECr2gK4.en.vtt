to snip the end of the yarn and take the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.580 
to snip the end of the yarn and take the
piece<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> yarn<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.989> set<00:00:49.170> aside<00:00:49.260> from

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
piece of yarn that we set aside from

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
just to make sure that it doesn't come

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:03.429 
just to make sure that it doesn't come
apart

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.209 

next<00:02:04.439> we're<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> take<00:02:04.859> the<00:02:05.039> scissors

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
next we're going to take the scissors

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
next we're going to take the scissors
and<00:02:05.700> insert<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.210> into<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.569> loop<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.020> just

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and insert it into the loop and just

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.469 
and insert it into the loop and just
snip<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.499> across<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.220> make<00:02:08.729> sure<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.269> use

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
snip it across and make sure you do use

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.059 
snip it across and make sure you do use
sharp<00:02:09.810> scissors<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.379> Seoul<00:02:10.739> scissors
