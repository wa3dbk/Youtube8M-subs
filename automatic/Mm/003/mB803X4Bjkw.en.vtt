final steps of building spiral staircase

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.490 
final steps of building spiral staircase
I'm<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.240> mount<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> platform<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.260> as

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
I'm going to mount the platform on as

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.070 
I'm going to mount the platform on as
you<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:22.980> I've<00:00:23.279> laid<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.610> down<00:00:23.750> touch<00:00:24.750> things

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
you see I've laid it down touch things

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
you see I've laid it down touch things
up<00:00:25.349> and<00:00:25.590> got<00:00:25.800> ready<00:00:26.009> it's<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> little<00:00:27.150> hard<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
up and got ready it's a little hard to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.439 
up and got ready it's a little hard to
mount<00:00:28.020> this<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.980> platform<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.270> hold

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
mount this up on the platform and hold

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
mount this up on the platform and hold
it<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.690> and<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.020> right<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.099> makes

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it up and get it right so this makes

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.710 
it up and get it right so this makes
things<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.760> lot<00:00:32.879> easier<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.449> set<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.690> down

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
things a lot easier we just set it down

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.970 
things a lot easier we just set it down
on<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> ground<00:00:34.080> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> mean<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.860> use

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
on the ground and then I mean just use

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.920 
on the ground and then I mean just use
measurements<00:00:35.519> so<00:00:36.769> what<00:00:37.769> you<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
measurements so what you want to do is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.280 
measurements so what you want to do is
use<00:00:39.930> some<00:00:39.960> quarter<00:00:40.559> inch<00:00:40.710> self<00:00:41.010> tappers

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
use some quarter inch self tappers

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.069 
use some quarter inch self tappers
tapping<00:00:43.290> screws<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.760> mount<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> on

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
tapping screws and and mount this on

00:00:46.079 --> 00:01:13.310 
tapping screws and and mount this on
there<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> proper<00:00:47.070> height

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.240 

again<00:01:14.320> I've<00:01:14.530> got<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.450> lines<00:01:16.450> where<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.250> last

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
again I've got the lines where the last

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.520 
again I've got the lines where the last
step<00:01:18.640> goes<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.300> this<00:01:19.630> is<00:01:19.780> how<00:01:19.930> we<00:01:19.990> line<00:01:20.290> it<00:01:20.440> up

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
step goes and this is how we line it up

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.140 
step goes and this is how we line it up
with<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.830> lines<00:01:21.040> that<00:01:21.220> are<00:01:21.310> on<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.610> spire<00:01:21.880> on

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
with the lines that are on the spire on

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.900 
with the lines that are on the spire on
the<00:01:22.390> pole<00:01:25.470> okay<00:01:26.470> on<00:01:26.680> this<00:01:26.860> platform<00:01:27.160> the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
the pole okay on this platform the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.300 
the pole okay on this platform the
reason<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.330> screw<00:01:28.690> it<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:29.050> is<00:01:29.380> because<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.130> makes

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
reason I screw it on is because it makes

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.460 
reason I screw it on is because it makes
it<00:01:30.430> rather<00:01:30.700> awkward<00:01:31.240> for<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.570> powder<00:01:31.990> coaters

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
it rather awkward for the powder coaters

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.210 
it rather awkward for the powder coaters
to<00:01:32.770> move<00:01:33.250> this<00:01:33.430> around<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.440> paint<00:01:35.440> it<00:01:35.619> as<00:01:35.770> it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
to move this around and paint it as it's

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.640 
to move this around and paint it as it's
fairly<00:01:36.400> easy<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:37.259> symmetrical<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.470> works

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
fairly easy and symmetrical it works

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.240 
fairly easy and symmetrical it works
pretty<00:01:38.830> good<00:01:38.950> without<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.110> also<00:01:41.830> we

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
pretty good without it on but I also we

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.010 
pretty good without it on but I also we
take<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.610> off<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.970> paint<00:01:43.180> powder<00:01:43.539> coat<00:01:43.720> it

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
take it off and paint powder coat it

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.830 
take it off and paint powder coat it
separately<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:45.160> that<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.820> get<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.210> good<00:01:46.570> powder

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
separately so that you get a good powder

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.510 
separately so that you get a good powder
coating<00:01:47.229> under<00:01:47.440> all<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> surfaces<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.460> you

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
coating under all the surfaces and you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.330 
coating under all the surfaces and you
don't<00:01:48.670> have<00:01:48.850> any<00:01:49.000> spots<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.509> will<00:01:49.630> rust

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
don't have any spots that will rust

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.070 
don't have any spots that will rust
rusting<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.490> an<00:01:51.640> important<00:01:52.060> factor<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.720> want

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
rusting is an important factor you want

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.430 
rusting is an important factor you want
to<00:01:53.170> make<00:01:53.289> sure<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:54.700> if<00:01:54.910> you<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:56.259> this
