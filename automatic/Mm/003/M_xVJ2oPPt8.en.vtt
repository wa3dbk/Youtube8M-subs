00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.880
 point 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.490
 good friends we meet electro 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.770
 rayco blanket and we present therefore a good 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.590
 video that we consider a myth 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.320
 a legend we have tried a little bit for 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 over in some videos of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.170
 enough time but good still 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.850
 arising and continues to serve as an excuse 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 some people and good from here 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.590
 We will try to stay to sell a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.899
 little bit of light on the subject and there is the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.899
 affirmation that quitting smoking makes you fat 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.310
 11 you already know that you do not 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.830
 stop smoking does not make you fat 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.320
 that is, there is no reason why 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.320
 stop smoking the blow the problem 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.620
 lies in getting like the tico after 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 to quit smoking is to channel 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.040
 all the anxiety that causes stop 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.560
 smoking eating and destroying everything 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.760
 that we can be chocolate and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.760
 all kinds of junk food 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.080
 therefore today that constantly 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.840
 People who come to me here or who come to me 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.810
 the query or who asks me by email 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.180
 or whatever I do as I do because if 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.750
 I stop smoking and it does not come out so much not clear 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.030
 the first the first greetings 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.930
 health is what you have therefore stop 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.160
 smoking at the level of sports performance 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.590
 It is obviously active but it is a 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.150
 level of health is horrible when you leave 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.060
 Smoking should be a priority of 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.580
 anyone who wants to do 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.160
 personal sport still between a life 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.430
 healthy because if we try to do 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.210
 sport to do it as something to do 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.040
 health and make it to be well 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.220
 smoking has to be left but 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.320
 in fact this can not serve once 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.740
 left as an excuse to win a 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.480
 ethical barbarity 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.080
 because there is no relationship 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.540
 of any kind now clear if instead of 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.299
 smoke a cigarette the substitute laser 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.580
 they are chips and they are pastries 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.099
 industrial and they are fast food and they are 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.890
 systematically wipe out all the 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.410
 community there we are lost 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.510
 there we are lost 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.040
 another recommendation that I would make to those 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.460
 people who stop smoking that by 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.830
 yes it is already a very difficult process and 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.110
 that requires a lot of will is that 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:52.100
 also then focus on sport 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.100
 that is to say that at the moment they decide 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.410
 stop smoking look for both help 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.290
 both are done alone or if it does not help 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.270
 to stop that habit but also 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.430
 help to acquire others 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.860
 good is how sport can be and 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.270
 healthy eating because otherwise 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:15.150
 the anxiety of quitting leads us 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.680
 to gain many kilos because normally 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.209
 everyone is passing 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.909
 and I repeat there is no any relationship 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.790
 among them quitting smoking does not make you fat 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:32.040
 but obviously a lot of people who do 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.040
 as hungry when they are thirsty smokes 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.070
 nicotine speeds up metabolism and there's 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.840
 one thing that is substitutive is tobacco 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.210
 so instead of eating a sandwich we 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.980
 we close what happens when they are both 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.210
 citizens come four lawyers and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.660
 all the criminals 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.000
 but I repeat there is no relationship between leaving 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.540
 of smoking and fattening the recommendation 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.250
 from here is that the person who stops 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:07.540
 smoke try to acquire some habits 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:11.530
 healthy people already pay for smoking and 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.410
 this way to channel much better what 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.350
 what is anxiety so that anxiety 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.720
 let's say be left in the gym gives me 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.840
 just hitting him a punching bag that 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.090
 doing squats that running from 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.180
 this whatever it is, it does not matter to me to traffic 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.169
 drugs since power that stroman but that 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.659
 channel that anxiety 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.820
 so that it is not channeled in the form of 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.860
 community 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.230
 and in the form of uncontrolled food 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.110
 because anxiety leads to a lack of control 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.190
 leads to the graphic person or the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.200
 discounts that person with that anxiety 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.449
 you will not normally eat the taxable 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.490
 salads 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.770
 and will eat what you find fast and 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.180
 be able to be something of pastries and something of 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.160
 chocolate that satiety 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.440
 therefore the recommendation always 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.419
 stop smoking do not go fence 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.940
 performance as we said yes but 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.750
 also for a health issue and that the 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.350
 recommendation is that it can help you 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.880
 seek wing - I say stop 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.030
 smoke Monday possible not with cards 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.220
 If I did not do it to try 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.550
 If he already did it, he looked for another objective 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.039
 more he looked for this he sought and control 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.699
 the diet looked already for that anxiety 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.280
 be channeled through sport and not through 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.050
 an excessive food because if not 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.000
 obviously always but to stop 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.039
 smoking shit the kilos but if a house 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.599
 better disease but the other way around 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.669
 disease then let's stop smoking 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.039
 but then we're going to eat everything 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.560
 let's find we're going to gain weight normally 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.860
 that person will not look good by not seeing 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.870
 well will tend to want to go back to smoking 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.940
 to lose weight again for a 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.590
 relationship your brain because your brain is 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.690
 hooked then your brain will try 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.910
 to read the same as well 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.830
 fat because to quit smoking so 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.100
 So much that I do I go back to smoking because I do not 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.860
 I want to see too thick thick or 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.560
 reach these kilos and you enter in a 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.890
 loop that I think the sport should be 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.780
 can be basic in this aspect so 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.960
 we both identify that quit smoking 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.210
 fattening but if it causes an anxiety that 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.160
 can lead us to put ourselves as kiko already 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.180
 they gained lots of kilos therefore 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:32.750
 knowing we try to anticipate that 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.490
 to channel it with parany the 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.410
 best organizer there may be the 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.030
 anxiety that is sport and so 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.710
 so much we have two birds with one stone ' 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.870
 we will stop smoking and above we 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.060
 we will get in shape without gaining kilos that 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.670
 we want it and if that person who stops 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.160
 smoking gets the sport and is 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.870
 better and you are more fit and you 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.170
 find that he has more air and he 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.050
 find in definite much more 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.300
 in shape your brain associated with stop 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.639
 Smoking will feel better 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.610
 and that person can forget 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:07.310
 perfectly of vice if the leaving that 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.319
 vice causes him to be more adding 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.960
 kilos be thicker feel worse with 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:14.599
 yourself see it in the mirror how easy 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.030
 it will be that between anxiety and looking bad 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.430
 back to back fall again by 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.069
 so we demystified this point and 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.159
 we recommend sport and healthy diet 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:27.470
 to try to overcome the anxiety that if 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:28.970
 well this has no relation if there is a 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.639
 relationship between the anxiety that causes 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:35.330
 when quitting smoking and trying to duplicate 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:37.969
 others as a complex subject 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.060
 but but how good that with will and 

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:44.300
 desire can be accepted so from 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.699
 here this first we specify the myth 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.530
 and second the advice that was shown from 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.599
 I agree well then let's hope that I have 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.150
 liked from here I encourage all 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:55.219
 people who are trying to leave it and 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.780
 good as always if there are doubts 

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:58.550
 as always in comments of the channel and 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.879
 as always if you want we'll see you in 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.879
 next 

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.330
 do not
