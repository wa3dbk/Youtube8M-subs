section so I suggest you check out the
rest<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.020> these<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.140> you're<00:00:28.410> done<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.770> this

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
rest of these and you're done with this

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.980 
rest of these and you're done with this
one<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:29.699> start<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.270> central<00:00:30.600> dogma

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
one we will start with the central dogma

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.979 
one we will start with the central dogma
of<00:00:31.260> molecular<00:00:31.609> biology<00:00:32.609> which<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of molecular biology which is the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.559 
of molecular biology which is the
underlying<00:00:34.680> principle<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.519> how<00:00:35.729> we<00:00:35.789> get<00:00:36.149> from

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:36.569 
underlying principle of how we get from

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:40.459 
underlying principle of how we get from
DNA<00:00:37.289> to<00:00:38.300> protein<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.449> actually<00:00:39.870> affects<00:00:40.289> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
DNA to protein that actually affects the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.579 
DNA to protein that actually affects the
body<00:00:41.159> that<00:00:41.760> makes<00:00:41.999> up<00:00:42.210> most<00:00:42.479> of<00:00:42.659> the<00:00:42.960> dry<00:00:43.289> mass

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
body that makes up most of the dry mass

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.340 
body that makes up most of the dry mass
of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.039> human<00:00:44.639> body<00:00:44.789> DNA<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.839> going<00:00:46.109> to<00:00:46.229> be

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of the human body DNA is going to be

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.299 
of the human body DNA is going to be
acted<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.829> by<00:00:47.190> DNA<00:00:47.850> polymerase<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.929> give<00:00:49.170> us

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
acted on by DNA polymerase to give us

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.289 
acted on by DNA polymerase to give us
replication<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.579> you're<00:00:50.850> basically<00:00:51.210> just

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
replication so you're basically just

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.860 
replication so you're basically just
doubling<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.229> DNA<00:00:52.679> so<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.159> can<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.519> into

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
doubling the DNA so you can go into

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.529 
doubling the DNA so you can go into
mitosis<00:00:54.870> meiosis<00:00:55.170> whatever<00:00:56.179> DNA<00:00:57.179> is<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.479> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
mitosis meiosis whatever DNA is going to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.930 
mitosis meiosis whatever DNA is going to
be<00:00:57.629> converted<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.109> RNA<00:00:58.679> which<00:00:59.429> is<00:00:59.579> immature

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
be converted to RNA which is immature

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.899 
be converted to RNA which is immature
through<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> process<00:01:01.319> of<00:01:01.469> transcription<00:01:02.159> via

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
through the process of transcription via

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.170 
through the process of transcription via
RNA<00:01:03.600> polymerase<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:05.010> immature<00:01:05.460> RNA<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.119> going

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
RNA polymerase the immature RNA is going

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
RNA polymerase the immature RNA is going
to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.479> processed<00:01:07.080> by<00:01:07.350> having<00:01:07.650> things<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:07.980> a
