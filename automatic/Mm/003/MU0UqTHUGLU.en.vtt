00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
the comments section I probably messed

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.950 
the comments section I probably messed
it<00:05:21.010> up<00:05:21.099> but<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:22.000> don't<00:05:22.120> mean<00:05:22.300> your<00:05:22.599> walkie<00:05:22.930> is

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
it up but you don't mean your walkie is

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.670 
it up but you don't mean your walkie is
looking<00:05:23.349> up<00:05:23.530> they<00:05:23.770> still<00:05:24.039> have<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.220> um<00:05:24.520> a

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
looking up they still have a um a

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.779 
looking up they still have a um a
winning<00:05:26.680> record<00:05:26.830> i<00:05:27.010> think<00:05:27.250> i<00:05:27.310> think<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.580> over

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
winning record i think i think the over

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.230 
winning record i think i think the over
500<00:05:28.440> but<00:05:29.440> they<00:05:29.770> are<00:05:29.949> in<00:05:30.160> East<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:30.669> I<00:05:30.760> thought<00:05:31.000> I

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
500 but they are in East and I thought I

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.279 
500 but they are in East and I thought I
thought<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.630> Bucks<00:05:31.870> could<00:05:32.050> have<00:05:32.169> probably

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
thought the Bucks could have probably

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.860 
thought the Bucks could have probably
made<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.770> playoffs<00:05:33.010> if<00:05:33.580> Jabari<00:05:34.210> was<00:05:34.510> healthy

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
made the playoffs if Jabari was healthy

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.750 
made the playoffs if Jabari was healthy
so<00:05:35.380> we<00:05:35.410> have<00:05:35.620> to<00:05:35.770> keep<00:05:35.949> our<00:05:36.099> eye<00:05:36.160> on<00:05:36.250> them<00:05:36.639> and

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
so we have to keep our eye on them and

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.400 
so we have to keep our eye on them and
see<00:05:36.910> if<00:05:36.940> they<00:05:37.090> can<00:05:37.240> still<00:05:37.419> make<00:05:37.599> playoffs<00:05:37.930> but

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
see if they can still make playoffs but

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.379 
see if they can still make playoffs but
I<00:05:38.470> was<00:05:38.620> happy<00:05:38.789> Muhammad<00:05:39.789> Ali<00:05:39.849> was
