maybe<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:02.180> think<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.530> probably<00:04:04.530> throttling

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.589 

could<00:04:11.580> be<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.790> reason<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.090> frame<00:04:12.300> rate<00:04:12.480> is

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
could be the reason the frame rate is

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.780 
could be the reason the frame rate is
not<00:04:12.810> as<00:04:12.930> good<00:04:13.080> as<00:04:13.230> those<00:04:13.410> other<00:04:13.610> tablets<00:04:14.610> I've

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
not as good as those other tablets I've

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.420 
not as good as those other tablets I've

there's a warm summer's day here too and

there's a warm summer's day here too and
it<00:05:00.799> got<00:05:01.009> up<00:05:01.189> to<00:05:03.099> 78.8<00:05:04.099> that's<00:05:04.519> quite<00:05:05.179> warm<00:05:07.779> and

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
it got up to 78.8 that's quite warm and

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.209 
it got up to 78.8 that's quite warm and
you<00:05:08.899> can<00:05:09.049> definitely<00:05:09.259> feel<00:05:09.589> that<00:05:09.649> on<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.009> back

a very warm okay screens gone off must

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.919 
a very warm okay screens gone off must
have<00:05:20.869> tipped<00:05:21.049> it<00:05:21.229> anyway<00:05:21.589> so<00:05:22.779> there<00:05:23.779> are<00:05:23.839> the

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:23.929 
have tipped it anyway so there are the

there<00:05:31.009> we<00:05:31.099> go<00:05:31.279> so<00:05:31.869> 78.5<00:05:33.699> actually<00:05:34.699> no<00:05:34.819> 88<00:05:35.889> sorry

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
there we go so 78.5 actually no 88 sorry

there we go so 78.5 actually no 88 sorry
I'm<00:05:37.009> upon<00:05:37.279> the<00:05:37.369> wrong<00:05:37.610> column<00:05:37.969> 88<00:05:38.479> degrees

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.319 
I'm upon the wrong column 88 degrees
that<00:05:39.079> is<00:05:39.429> that's<00:05:40.429> a<00:05:40.610> problem<00:05:40.849> that's<00:05:41.089> an<00:05:41.239> issue

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:41.329 
that is that's a problem that's an issue

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:43.379 
that is that's a problem that's an issue
that's<00:05:42.139> only<00:05:42.319> from<00:05:42.499> a<00:05:42.589> little<00:05:42.799> bit<00:05:42.889> of<00:05:42.949> gaming

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
that's only from a little bit of gaming

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.109 
that's only from a little bit of gaming
so<00:05:44.389> that's<00:05:44.599> a<00:05:44.659> very<00:05:44.689> hot<00:05:45.079> system<00:05:45.939> we<00:05:46.939> have<00:05:46.969> a

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:47.119 
so that's a very hot system we have a

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:49.539 
so that's a very hot system we have a
look<00:05:47.269> at<00:05:47.360> my<00:05:47.659> other<00:05:47.809> video<00:05:48.169> I've<00:05:48.439> got<00:05:49.189> on<00:05:49.369> this

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:49.549 
look at my other video I've got on this

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.309 
look at my other video I've got on this
model<00:05:49.849> I<00:05:49.969> do<00:05:50.029> have<00:05:50.479> a<00:05:50.719> video<00:05:50.899> I've<00:05:51.139> actually
