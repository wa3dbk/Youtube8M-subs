00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 When I thaw away from the northern skies near the thaw and scream daily dreams 

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:58.500
 People who never go back have their hot heart set and start traveling alone from today 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:09.600
 Oh somewhere in Japan 

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:19.700
 There are people waiting for me 

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:38.600
 Have a nice day trip Take a song with the song I heard on my mother's back to find the sunset 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:14.800
 Does the boy return the small diameter of the fish sloping blue susuki to the end of the brow? 

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:34.000
 I am going to write in the sand dead wood to create memories from now on "Goodbye" 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:45.000
 Oh somewhere in Japan 

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:55.000
 There are people waiting for me 

00:02:55.001 --> 00:03:14.000
 Have a nice day trip Let's go along with the song my father taught me to find out the sheep's clouds 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 Oh somewhere in Japan 

00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:34.900
 There are people waiting for me 

00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:53.400
 Have a nice day out to sing along the song you sang as a kid to find happiness
