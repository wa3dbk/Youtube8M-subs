00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.350
 Hurt so much 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:13.400
 then people after a transaction of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.400
 four months without even I came back 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.189
 now to stay 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:29.480
 because dengue fever 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:32.099
 Okay, I did the first application yesterday and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.019
 I wanted to show you that I have 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.640
 of enem application when I still 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.440
 applied whole hair 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 So there are people until today asking me 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.019
 if I apply at the tips do not wait like 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.949
 my hair was not yet what my 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.680
 Hair is natural, I do not use the chatterbox 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.899
 it also causes dryer 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.360
 which gives 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.369
 then show you how I do a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.570
 root retouch I think I already said I 'm 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.869
 being repetitive 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.500
 before applying enem at night 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:08.400
 The previous one that I went through did not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.460
 hectare with oil that was that both the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.009
 queen and how much hair is lacking 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 mainly because I left the city 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.790
 That was bad for my hometown. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.380
 and wherever you want air conditioning 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.380
 conditioning turns off my hair 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.509
 so always when I pass my 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.310
 hair reaches the maximum was only not enough 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.030
 how I stay there my hair is fine 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.640
 safe 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.280
 When I woke up I went through a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.030
 little olive oil on the tips 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.609
 of the hair only at the tips 6 a part in the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.479
 Length down here - here 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:47.130
 only at the tips for those who help 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.799
 protect yourself a little when it comes to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.670
 enem province does not get so long and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.509
 office is an all-purpose movie that the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.149
 Rene taher I the movie only some parts 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.999
 to get you out all right as I do is 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.999
 the first step in heaven 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:08.009
 all the marches I got the brush 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:11.430
 only that in the root as it will show the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.590
 video to come back I used what I most 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.300
 I like and do not want to change 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.400
 The tac is a is by his forte I have not used nor 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.880
 very well to do the retouching of rails 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.910
 this seller 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.520
 I leave and here through the No. 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.470
 looked at the situation of my 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.090
 car 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.620
 The first photo was on the day cleared. 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.740
 hair soon after it is collected 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.990
 according to ft fan 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.270
 now how I did a touch-up from there to 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.700
 I always started to have hair in the middle 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.960
 up with the piranhas and I'm letting go 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 slowly 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.230
 while I always apply enem 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.580
 every fuse I brush I remember 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.680
 that root retouch you 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.260
 definitely just need to pass the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.560
 girl raises and does not respond from the way 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.150
 to not let fragile not break 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.010
 after the applied enem always go to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.110
 Extra virgin olive night in rest 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.280
 of the hair to sink time marking 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.990
 the end was this 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.620
 I do not know if you can see much better. 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.760
 so here I 've had a good laugh my 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:27.140
 hair is already presentable or 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.090
 show the other is not perfect either 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:35.140
 but also I already that behind is a 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.140
 problem to walk 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:52.220
 a wave of a large enough here 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.330
 but I think even applications are in the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.090
 root but the boy is going to help okay 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.330
