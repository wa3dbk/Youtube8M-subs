00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.809
 So have friends pumping parents today 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.700
 we made a theme again and that 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.639
 That's where bodybuilding has become so 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.230
 I have been developing for 30 years now 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.450
 here and I think that bodybuilding 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.090
 actually develop very well 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.689
 broke and now a bodybuilding 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.119
 whether or not everyone has become part of everyone 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.700
 he now bodybuilding lifestyle for himself 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.630
 practically is practically practiced or 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.250
 not practiced everyone needs his 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.730
 muscles keep your body in swing 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.440
 so that he moves his everyday life 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.120
 easier to endure 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.839
 What is very important factor is what I am 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.089
 more and more now feel also to mine 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:56.530
 person that education not only 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:59.589
 the superficial forming of the body 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.440
 holland is also spiritually minded too 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.900
 when one says bodybuilding does not belong 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.150
 only the musculature even the organs 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.149
 worthy of preference that the organs fit 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.600
 need a healthy way of life 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.770
 healthy outer provides 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.659
 that is for me to prove so 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.750
 is not like other sports 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.210
 that one might give him one and a half 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.560
 playing football for hours and then tapping 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.479
 go and 23 half a piece or one 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.520
 23 cigarettes after the football 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.240
 kindle and said he has a healthy one 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.520
 way of life 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.360
 That's it's not bodybuilding anymore 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.119
 really very aware now 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.039
 So have the sport live this 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.049
 want to want to live consciously 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:49.810
 it also depends on being aware 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.490
 many can achieve many more success 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.930
 like if you unconsciously have any 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.930
 things do what I also merkel is that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:05.560
 of course different clichÃ©s there too 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:08.810
 is an externally well- trained but 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.470
 his muscle somewhere 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.239
 it must be possible to show that he is one 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.489
 ghost does not only form his body 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.190
 but forms with spiritual thing he has 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.830
 we should never do anything 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.410
 No matter what he does, he is 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.680
 with us in a studio and trained 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.330
 what we train also close friends 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.230
 Meanwhile, we are thinking where 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.269
 food comes from what we eat 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.610
 how should we eat how much we should eat 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:43.459
 I'm supposed to eat 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:46.760
 meanwhile we find that beginning 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.690
 then eat so what costs wolf cost 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.060
 what it wants 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.910
 as much as possible without thinking 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.560
 for what and why, of course, then you have 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.160
 also seen accordingly below me 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.720
 that with 15 to 20 kilo fat him 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.090
 gone is this wave also brings 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.190
 problems with itself so I think now 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.290
 it was almost ten to twelve 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.180
 million member members in the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.820
 fitness studio 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.850
 but we need at least 10 to 15 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.739
 years until we enlighten these members 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.250
 What does bodybuilding do? 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.980
 can 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.900
 I have a lot of athletes who 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.720
 first time to go on stage 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.450
 if this is a class or if that is 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.069
 Body class is you come and want 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.799
 Do not participate because they are from this 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.350
 are still convincing in life but 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.079
 because the others join in and for this 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.569
 I can give people from her one can 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.310
 not from zero to 100 so the rise 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.489
 would like to spend two years 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.489
 goes on the stage and also the 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.079
 dominate or win championship 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.459
 but the championships will be of the 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.010
 people have won 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.870
 the 56 years already participate 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.630
 five six times preparation behind 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.700
 have and what I know ten 15 years 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.310
 bring or train longer than 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.130
 who want to join 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.390
 my problem is also that the people 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.700
 after two years come to me one 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.770
 booking and immediately on the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.519
 stage as they want to go 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.880
 But they also make their success 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.800
 from ercan demir dependent on me 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.450
 we do not want to do anything ourselves 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.110
 We seem to give them a nutrition plan 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.600
 and nutritional plan will not even be 50 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.960
 is practiced percent and at the end 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.560
 Nevertheless, the coach is guilty of what I do 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 my 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.890
 We need these ten million customers 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.410
 Formulate again and clarify what 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.720
 that means bodybuilding brings 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.940
 is not a story for a two 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.360
 years if you do that but that's it 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.340
 a lifelong employment and 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.550
 lifestyle you should practice 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.130
 I have 45 athletes recently 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.530
 I have to say ten 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.930
 athletes may have 200 percent 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.090
 pulled through I see it also who something 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.940
 makes and who does not do anything you can see 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.430
 on the form week to week whether one 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.350
 His song is 100 percent consistent 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.660
 pulled through or not 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.050
 the problem is not 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.970
 have pulled through have none 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.060
 Realization that this was their mistake 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.450
 not fault of the trainer or carer 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.750
 or that's why we become a consultant 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.090
 Really need a long time yet 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.840
 we would solve that wave whats going on 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:46.479
 she is all enlightening what 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.760
 bodybuilding means we have that way 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.820
 a hard work ahead of us there is 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.440
 insightful athletes do not exist 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.720
 to discard more clearly 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.000
 I hope he understood what I did 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.070
 Bodybuilding will say that 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.150
 view has developed very well and 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.270
 We will continue to do so very much 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.940
 benefit 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.100
 i just wanted to address one topic i 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.400
 Hope you liked this speech 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.250
 that people do not know 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.710
 of this matter a bit of its own 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.720
 nose 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.240
 and not to supervisors or 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.150
 grab berater's nose and say he has 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.530
 everything was wrong with me 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.640
 subscribe to my channel pumping bay windows 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.510

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.510
 All the best
