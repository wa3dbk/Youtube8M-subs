video<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:15.800> guys<00:03:17.620> pretty<00:03:18.620> much<00:03:18.739> all<00:03:19.070> around

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
video you guys pretty much all around

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
identical it's kind of like the song

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.540 
identical it's kind of like the song
flash<00:03:25.940> one<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> salt<00:03:27.110> flash<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.650> pretty

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
flash one and the salt flash to pretty

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.479 
flash one and the salt flash to pretty
much<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:29.030> think<00:03:29.690> this<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.870> it's<00:03:30.800> a<00:03:30.950> little<00:03:31.310> I

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
much I think this is it's a little I

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.000 
much I think this is it's a little I
think<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:32.030> salt<00:03:32.360> flash<00:03:32.660> one<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.260> little

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
think the salt flash one is a little

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.910 
think the salt flash one is a little
museum<00:03:34.670> at<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:34.850> little<00:03:35.120> bit<00:03:35.209> here<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:36.650> salt

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
museum at a little bit here the salt

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.530 
museum at a little bit here the salt
flash<00:03:37.190> one<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.640> little<00:03:37.970> bit<00:03:38.090> smaller<00:03:38.420> than

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
flash one is a little bit smaller than

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.850 
flash one is a little bit smaller than
this<00:03:39.910> which<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.239> think<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> salt<00:03:42.140> flash<00:03:42.410> one<00:03:42.709> is

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
this which I think the salt flash one is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.280 
this which I think the salt flash one is
a<00:03:42.950> great<00:03:43.310> knife<00:03:43.880> but<00:03:44.420> it's<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.690> little<00:03:44.989> bit<00:03:45.110> on

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
a great knife but it's a little bit on

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.680 
a great knife but it's a little bit on
the<00:03:45.440> two<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> little<00:03:46.610> bit<00:03:46.700> too<00:03:46.910> small<00:03:47.420> for

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
the two it's a little bit too small for

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.620 
the two it's a little bit too small for
me<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.989> don't<00:03:48.760> I'm<00:03:49.760> one<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.120> those<00:03:50.209> guys<00:03:50.269> are
