00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 comes nine frames to give the most 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.500
 amount of possible space he told us he 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.379
 normally when one does not have those 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.350
 teeth that regulate the distance place 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.230
 10 pictures at the beginning and then try to 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.230
 take it to 9 to the extent that 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.160
 bees filled the combs once 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.679
 that we have the hive armed with 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.390
 hike in all your squares placed as 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:38.250
 this one we have to place the lid 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 the lid takes a lid / lid first 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 back cover 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.500
 is this style can be placed if 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.720
 It gives more space to the bee to 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.660
 circular or you can go 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.810
 placed in this other way where not 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.810
 they have their cuts down 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.160
 and over 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.299
 On top of that / lid the lid is placed 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:15.490
 it is a telescopic cover that is 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:19.079
 the one that needs to take the previous stage 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.079
 everything is covering 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.740
 telescopic because it is closed to 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.440
 sides and you put an ax so that 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.400
 protect it from the humidity of the rain and 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.530
 over it to protect the will return to 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.980
 support a weight a stone 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.020
 by the brick 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.009
 whatever 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.960
 the stone and it started will probably be 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.979
 the most convenient so that living not 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.979
 can lift the lid 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.080
 now let's place the other kind of 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.430
 stage that is the Californian the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.300
 Californian is a stage that has 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.119
 forward and back edges and in the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.640
 postulates is not placed in such a way 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.720
 that the rims are on the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.320
 headers and sides 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.830
 it does not come from edges then if you put a 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.200
 stone on top that supports this lid 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.030
 as it does not have / is arming in this 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 case the bees what they do with 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.180
 propolis stick the lid on the drawer 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.140
 every time you go to the hive you have 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.510
 that with the lever 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.610
 detach the lid is attached to the drawer 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.460
 while the previous the telescopic 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 what the bees hit is the chalk 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:54.709
 for the lid one removes it normally without 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.990
 biggest problem and the entry stage is the 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.990
 that usually the bee
