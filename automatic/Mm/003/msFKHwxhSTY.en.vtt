00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980
 strong they reach seven matches 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.380
 consecutive without losing 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.910
 the cross teacher carries that record leads 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.889
 seven games without losing 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 he wants to be that he's going to win 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.890
 give toluca to the best 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.090
 but from that he wins tigers he wins 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:30.239
 tigers is like that tigers I stayed in the house 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.790
 already about the bed already sitting on the 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.350
 last television to be watching the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.920
 match 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.519
 Y 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.680
 Well, it was normal for me to see if it changed 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:46.840
 the attitude this but I'm seeing the goal 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.460
 polishing 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:56.370
 and I was so cramped to see so much 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:00.040
 art in a goal art from the center 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.340
 until the contact of the ball in the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.670
 repetition measure the distance I gave 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.020
 who marked it I saw that the goalkeeper flew 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.940
 no no no no what goal got polished and you know 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.200
 I turned off the TV I went to my bed 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.930
 to be thinking about that goal nothing more 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.649
 in that goal because I had not seen a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.860
 goal well on the volcano at any time to 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.600
 no player of any price and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.869
 I thought where I've seen a goal like that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.090
 I had to go to europe and fall into 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.330
 the likes of zinedine zidane 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.790
 did zinedine zidane once saw him a 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.909
 goal so 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.759
 that is 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.640
 and this boy from the portuguese realmadrid 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.640
 has poured a ball and did not make a goal 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.159
 so so so you have not gotten it has gotten 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.859
 with skill and terrible in shooting at 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.310
 angle what you want but I do not 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.670
 I had seen steals 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.300
 drogba has scored a goal like that 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.520
 it's hard to find a goal like that 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.720
 that hall 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.280
 central wolves luke precise measured 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.170
 precise but the vocation of polishing 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.240
 grab the ball and since you see it coming 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:29.410
 the ball thinks about hitting three 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.590
 fingers thinks about hitting it like that and the ball 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.430
 grabs an unexpected direction and leaves 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.860
 to the upper corner of the left and so on 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.770
 you throw to the goal is already a merit 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.010
 although the one for the goalkeeper but he put it 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.010
 at angle 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.290
 the tip of the left foot standing on 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.120
 the tip of the left foot as if it were 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:59.349
 a pass art ballet art size 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:03.209
 of the paintings of rafa the art of 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:08.019
 size of seopÃ¡n classical music 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.280
 art that is art is a kick zone 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.490
 local 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.520
 is to be a game is to be a goal that 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.860
 merited I do not know if one day 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.720
 in the new monterrey stadium they go to 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.360
 have a balls and I think it's going to happen 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.319
 all the life of the stadium and there's going to be 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.989
 nobody who scored a goal of that caliber 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.469
 is the best goal in the history of tigers 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.430
 at all times like this I do not 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.639
 there is another equal 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:46.290
 there have been very beautiful goals but as 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:46.290
 this really my respects Mr. polished 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:00.700
 it's all friends that have you half 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.700
 dozen congratulations on this day
