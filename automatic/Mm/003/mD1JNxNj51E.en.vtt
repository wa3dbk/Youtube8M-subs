00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello everyone you know navarro and in 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.010
 outsiders present this new section 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.610
 where will I give you my opinion on trailers 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.610
 and movies 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.220
 a term that I derived from mythology 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.900
 Nordic is the title of a poem in 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.580
 where the deception god expresses what 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.740
 his first before the gods and makes them see 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.570
 its flaws and its virtues and this is 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.520
 exactly what they can do in this 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.020
 section give you my opinion about the good 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.550
 and the bad of the trailers and the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.379
 movies in this first video 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.000
 we will talk about the third footballer 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.000
 the magnificent de disney 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.480
 no doubt this is the trolley more 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.519
 exciting that we have seen of maleficent 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 and it's customary that instead of starting with 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.329
 the castle of the sleeping beauty the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 trailer start with that of maleficent 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.539
 this is the truth of the best 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.399
 details he had says excited 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.870
 too much later he continues in scene of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.600
 maleficent entering the palace what 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.009
 it seems to be the presentation of aurora 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.869
 inside presents us with the curse of 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.759
 maleficent we see how she is with the baby and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.380
 we see how he is saying so many things 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.880
 that at the age of 16 he will get pinched 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.880
 finger with the king and die 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.159
 exaggeratedly faithful to history 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.930
 so many years like that should be all 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.930
 adaptations 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.630
 I love the phrase you are using 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.250
 traders to know the story now 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.960
 You will know the truth because it makes you 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.369
 think that the story we already know 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.990
 how life really is not the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.300
 true is another version of the story 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.640
 and that's exactly what this is looking for 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.470
 movie introduce us to malefic as the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.300
 protagonist of a story instead of a 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.280
 the sleeping beauty 'clearly you see that 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.960
 maleficent feels a hatred towards the kingdom and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.450
 we can also see the rivalry that 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.880
 exists between her and the three fairies flora 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.440
 fauna and spring to whom it occurred to him 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.150
 put umbrid pain as one of the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.860
 Disney's best fairies in the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.570
 animated movie we know that existed 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.160
 this rivalry because they hated 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.350
 maleficent and maleficent I hated them 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.820
 but it was never explained why then 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.950
 I think that in this movie we are going to 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.780
 explain that rivalry because it 's obvious 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.459
 bad because they hate it because all this 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.870
 roll and every time I see scene from 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.870
 maleficent coming out of the darkness 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.250
 I get excited I think angelina jolie like 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.680
 maleficent was the best decision he could 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.020
 have disney the princess if I like 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.780
 but I do not know I did not love it I liked it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.910
 a prettier girl clearly you see the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.800
 age difference in this movie and 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.570
 in the disney classic because the 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.060
 disney classic they look like adults and 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.710
 in this movie you see children but the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.480
 truth is that this movie is the one that 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.130
 It's good because the kids look like 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.840
 age that the princess must have 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.700
 Aurora pricked her finger with the distaff 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.800
 16 years old so it has to be a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.750
 girl of 16 years or at least looks like a 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.250
 16 year old girl and in a classic 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.960
 disney the truth is that it seems that it is 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.960
 with in his twenties the prince 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.280
 Anyway, that 's what makes you weird 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.630
 not that they spend big here enter 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.180
 guys here but it's actually also 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.390
 this adaptation is like the Little Mermaid the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.640
 tape is 16 years old and he got married to be 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.780
 teaching their children after they appear 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.460
 these scenes hernÃ¡n video where 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.110
 maleficent with fairies the truth that never 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.640
 live well 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.720
 you are a space that they had to 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.180
 see her with wings to really 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.890
 wonder why he had horns ever 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.720
 in life we have asked ourselves why 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.450
 maleficent had horns and it was until 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.040
 we see it with wings that we said has wings 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.800
 has horns make a kind of being 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.560
 mystic that protects the forest as 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.650
 opened three to one 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.930
 this father and this at the beginning as I said 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.300
 no but then I heard the phrase that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.069
 I made a maleficent at some point in life 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.540
 I had fairies but they were taken from me then 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.270
 this makes you think that it 's like a guy 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.920
 fallen angel excellent table without in tone 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.840
 dark that are giving this movie of 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.670
 disney I have the theory that malefic 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.950
 was some kind of forest guardian 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.780
 but suddenly the king gave orders to see 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.849
 to his kingdom then they decided to cut down 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.620
 some trees this made that malefic 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.930
 he got angry and attacked the soldiers 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.790
 then he was told I want his head 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.160
 then they went to fight against evil 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.380
 maleficent got angry a lot more and started to 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.750
 kill soldiers and this massacre was the one 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.519
 he made his wings take away the truth 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.680
 is that for all the interest what it says 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.680
 maleficent this sounds pretty logical 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.280
 the dark and mysterious touch to the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.440
 history the effects of this movie are 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.960
 see really incredible I will never understand 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.820
 because the rooms are yes and that's what I 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.040
 did a little bit of excess if there's a 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.270
 movie but x is parents in holland 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.740
 I'm very excited for this movie 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.210
 I love the turn they are giving to 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.340
 the story and the truth is but with everything 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.290
 says do not disappoint me though it's 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.820
 disney and disney usually never 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.560
 disappoints 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.690
 only with cow cows or a sequel 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.550
 of the terrible princesses the movie 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.900
 has a release date for May 30 to 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.310
