the person has an idea what they want I
usually<00:01:22.460> start<00:01:22.880> with<00:01:22.969> a<00:01:23.060> with<00:01:23.420> an<00:01:23.509> idea<00:01:23.810> in<00:01:24.020> my

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
usually start with a with an idea in my

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.559 
usually start with a with an idea in my
head<00:01:24.429> once<00:01:25.429> I<00:01:25.579> have<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:25.759> going<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:26.479> that's

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
head once I have that going and that's

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.499 
head once I have that going and that's
like<00:01:26.869> fifty<00:01:27.259> percent<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:27.709> the<00:01:27.799> job<00:01:28.039> is<00:01:28.250> done<00:01:28.509> if

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
like fifty percent of the job is done if

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.389 
like fifty percent of the job is done if
you<00:01:29.659> can<00:01:29.840> see<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.140> end<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.469> it<00:01:30.649> it's<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.159> goes<00:01:31.369> a

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
you can see the end of it it's it goes a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.260 
you can see the end of it it's it goes a
lot<00:01:31.640> faster<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.869> once<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.709> have<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:33.920> I<00:01:34.399> go<00:01:35.060> with

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
lot faster so once I have that I go with

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.569 
lot faster so once I have that I go with
a<00:01:35.299> chainsaw<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.840> basically<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.890> draw<00:01:37.189> on<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
a chainsaw and basically I draw on the

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.819 
a chainsaw and basically I draw on the
tree<00:01:38.030> as<00:01:38.179> if<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.509> was<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> pencil<00:01:39.170> basically<00:01:39.649> i

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
tree as if it was a pencil basically i

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.699 
tree as if it was a pencil basically i
use<00:01:40.280> my<00:01:40.489> sauce<00:01:40.789> drawing<00:01:41.750> tool<00:01:41.989> like<00:01:42.349> I<00:01:42.530> can

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
use my sauce drawing tool like I can

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.039 
use my sauce drawing tool like I can
make<00:01:42.890> shapes<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.489> the<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.819> tree<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.599> big

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
make shapes on the on the tree the big

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.050 
make shapes on the on the tree the big
saws<00:01:45.289> are<00:01:45.619> mostly<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.189> take<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.640> lot<00:01:46.819> of<00:01:46.849> wood

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
saws are mostly to take a lot of wood

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.870 
saws are mostly to take a lot of wood
fast<00:01:47.360> then<00:01:48.170> i<00:01:48.319> go<00:01:48.470> into<00:01:48.619> smaller<00:01:48.979> tools<00:01:49.340> and

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
fast then i go into smaller tools and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.199 
fast then i go into smaller tools and
then<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.420> hand<00:01:50.720> tools<00:01:50.959> and<00:01:51.860> after<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.429> is<00:01:52.970> it

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
then the hand tools and after that is it

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.990 
then the hand tools and after that is it
finishing<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:54.649> either<00:01:55.310> paint<00:01:55.670> or
