00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
嘿 kiwi fruit!嘿 kiwi fruit! Hey! Kiwi ~ 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.390
 (Newspaper: Gorillas escape from the zoo) 嘿 Kiwifruit!嘿 kiwi fruit! Hey! Kiwi ~ 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.340
嘿 kiwi fruit!嘿 kiwi fruit! Hey! Kiwi ~ 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.170
 What are you doing? I am reading the newspaper! 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.610
 Hahahahahaha, what is your voice, dude? 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.020
 Hahahahahaha 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.160
 I am a kiwi, from New Zealand. 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.190
喔~ This will explain the tone of your speech. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.370
 There is also why there is a pullback on the other side (Note: its practical back to the darts hunting is the Australian Aboriginal, Liu Ding is wrong) 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.780
 I told you about it! We are bananas! 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.570
 Cavity tone.. 嗝 (hiccup) ~ I did not... 嗝 (hiccup) ~ cavity tone! 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.780
 So what is the hippo (hippo, Liu Ding and misunderstood) accent? 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.810
 What I am saying is...hiccup~not a hippo tone, is...嗝~ 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570
 Wow, it sounds like "Hungry Hungry Hippo" (a small game) 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.710
 Hahahahahaha 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.130
 This is all... oh~ not funny! 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130
 What's the matter with you, kiwi? How does it seem to choke? 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.300
 Hahahahahaha 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.740
 Shut up...嗝~I feel very uncomfortable..嗝~ 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.540
 Are you ok? 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.600
 What happened! ? 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 Oh, no! Beware of everyone! 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.620
 He is exploding! ! ! ! ! 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.750
 What? ! 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.050
 What is going on? 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.180
 Honestly, I just heard....oh my god! 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.240
 It’s kiwi! He has just been a hippos. 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.070
 It is hiccup, it has just been snoring, idiot! 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 What? ! Oh my God, that’s terrible! 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.620
 What are you talking about? 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.830
 Haven't you heard that if the fruit has been snoring, what will happen? 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.480
 Oh... no yeah 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.480
 First of all, they will always fight 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.340
 then... 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 They are....just... 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.230
 They will explode! 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.690
 Hahahahaha 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.690
 This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!嗝~ 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.310
 Ah 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.010
 Here is 911, what is the emergency? 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.180
 This is the case, we have a Liu Ding here to fight 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 Hey... please say it again. 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.770
 I said that there is a pudding in the war. 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 Do not! You are finished! Ah~~ 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.690
 This is good, I have nothing to lose. 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.070
 Everyone listened well. 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.090
 The most important thing now is that we have to stay calm. 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.760
 Wow, ah~~~ 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.050
 (No, no! Everyone keeps quiet!) Wow, ah~~~ 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.470
 (No, no! Everyone keeps quiet!) 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 We can't be crazy and lose our mind! 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.470
 You can say it easily, there is no hippo in your stomach! 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.960
 Dude, not a hippo. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.610
 It is the hippo that will explode! ! 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.400
 Listen to me, Liu Ding, do you want to stop fighting? 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.890
 Of course I want to! 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.680
 Then you have to do exactly what I said, ok? 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.410
 Ok! 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.050
 it is good! The method is simple 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.370
 The only thing you have to do is to start to shut up for thirty seconds now! 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.830
 it is good! 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.510
 What? This is useless. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.410
 I feel that I should stand upside down at this time. 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.970
 Is it going to sing? 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.580
 What? 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.210
 I heard that someone smashed the American national anthem when fighting, it works! 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.460
 (哼American National Anthem) 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.570
 I think he should breathe in the paper bag. 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.350
 The only thing he should do is to continue to marry the American national anthem. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.960
 You all shut up! 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.220
 That's useless! 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.340
 Liu Ding~ 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.340
 Liu Ding? ! Can you hear my voice? 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 Sober, Liu Ding! 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.610
 Liu Ding! ! Are you ok? 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 Who is the light? 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.700
 Dude, you just fainted after you hit it. 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.580
 Oh, why am I still good now? 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.140
 Liu Ding, have you noticed? 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.130
 correct! Its snoring 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.130
 It disappeared! ! 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.030
 Yeah ~~~! ! ! 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.600
 belch! 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.160
 Oh no~! 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.330
 I am sorry everyone! I didn't mean to become a snoring bomb. 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
 Oh! Liu Ding, this is not your fault. 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.600
 Everyone has this happening, and you can see the kiwifruit. 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.590
 I know, it’s fried everywhere. 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.660
 Hahahahahaha 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.270
 Oh 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.450
 We have to think of ways to stop the fight! 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.280
 Oh, no! The situation is getting worse and worse! 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.070
 Help..嗝~我..嗝~ 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.440
嘿柳丁, although we just met 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.260
 But we really regret that you have happened this... 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.260
 You look so good one... 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.700
 What happened? I do not know! 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.150
 That looks a bit like... 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.840
 Gorilla! 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.850
 Wow! It’s really a slap in the face (monkey around literally translated as a monkey nearby, Liu Ding’s pun) 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.990
 Hahahahahaha 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.910
 How did it come in here? 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.430
 Poor back to the dart! I don't think they can fly back anymore. 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.420
 Hahahahahaha 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.800
 Ok, we all know, enough! 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.370
 I wonder if they are a bouncer, why not just knock down the gorilla? 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.590
 Hahahahahaha 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.070
 Oh, my God! Liu Ding, your fight... 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.180
 What happened to you? 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.330
 You are no longer fighting! 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.310
 Wow, the gorilla scared the snoring! 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.490
 Yeah~! 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.270
 Oh, so I said...嗝~ 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.270
 Oh, it’s terrible! 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.730
