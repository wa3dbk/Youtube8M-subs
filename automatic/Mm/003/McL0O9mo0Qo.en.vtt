to work just being a good team isn't

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.210 
to work just being a good team isn't
good<00:03:45.090> enough<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.780> being<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.110> great<00:03:46.860> shooter

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220

isn't good enough and the players play
the<00:03:49.829> games<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.489> it's<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.910> players<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.269> got
