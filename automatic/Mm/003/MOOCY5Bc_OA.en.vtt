researcher<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.310> more

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
researcher what I think is more

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
researcher what I think is more
interesting<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.570> fact<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
interesting is the fact that in the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
interesting is the fact that in the
front<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> each<00:01:16.770> controller<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.580> actually<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
front of each controller is actually a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
front of each controller is actually a

that<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:59.070> emits<00:01:59.670> infrared<00:01:59.939> light<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that actually emits infrared light and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.630 
that actually emits infrared light and
this<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> simple<00:02:01.619> device<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.460> could

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
this is a simple device you could

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
this is a simple device you could
probably<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.390> yourself<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> quick

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
probably make one yourself with a quick

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350 
probably make one yourself with a quick
trip<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.979> an<00:02:05.070> electronic<00:02:05.399> store<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.119> is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
trip to an electronic store all that is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.199 
trip to an electronic store all that is
is<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> battery<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.290> button<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.069> an<00:02:08.310> LED<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
is a battery a button and an LED and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.080 
is a battery a button and an LED and
when<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.479> press<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> button<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.649> LED<00:02:10.679> turns<00:02:11.280> on

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
when I press the button the LED turns on

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.830 
when I press the button the LED turns on
and<00:02:12.450> now<00:02:12.660> using<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> software<00:02:14.569> what<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.690> does

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and now using the software what it does

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.990 
and now using the software what it does
is<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.080> reads<00:02:16.349> data<00:02:16.620> from<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> Wii<00:02:17.459> Remote<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
is it reads data from the Wii Remote and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.960 
is it reads data from the Wii Remote and
when<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> press<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> button<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:20.310> camera<00:02:20.819> can

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
when I press the button the camera can

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.680 
when I press the button the camera can
see<00:02:21.180> where<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.989> pine<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:23.300> by<00:02:24.300> doing<00:02:24.360> a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
see where the pine is and by doing a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.229 
see where the pine is and by doing a
quick<00:02:24.900> calibration<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:28.580> can<00:02:29.580> now<00:02:29.700> control<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
quick calibration I can now control the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.410 
quick calibration I can now control the
mouse<00:02:30.360> cursor<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:31.769> my<00:02:31.920> pen<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.209> little

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
mouse cursor with my pen so this little

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.150 
mouse cursor with my pen so this little
piece<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.780> fabric<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.260> now<00:02:34.410> an<00:02:34.739> interactive

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
piece of fabric is now an interactive

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.210 
piece of fabric is now an interactive
whiteboard<00:02:36.049> here's<00:02:37.049> photoshop<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
whiteboard here's photoshop so this is a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.320 
whiteboard here's photoshop so this is a
simple<00:02:38.489> drawing<00:02:38.879> program<00:02:39.500> hello<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.060> can

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
simple drawing program hello so you can

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.660 
simple drawing program hello so you can
see<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.720> actually<00:02:42.989> works<00:02:43.140> quite<00:02:43.379> well<00:02:43.670> for

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
see it actually works quite well for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.009 
see it actually works quite well for
about<00:02:44.940> fifty<00:02:45.299> dollars<00:02:45.599> of<00:02:45.750> incremental

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
about fifty dollars of incremental

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.580 
about fifty dollars of incremental
hardware<00:02:47.239> let<00:02:48.239> me<00:02:48.329> show<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:49.380> other

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
hardware let me show you this other

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.339 
hardware let me show you this other
program<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:51.569> nice<00:02:51.720> thing<00:02:51.959> is<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.170> this

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
program the nice thing is that this

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.710 
program the nice thing is that this
controls<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.980> mouse<00:02:53.220> cursor<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.849> any<00:02:54.299> if

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
controls the mouse cursor so any if

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.670 
controls the mouse cursor so any if
you're<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> teacher<00:02:55.019> if<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.560> any

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
you're a teacher if you have any

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.259 
you're a teacher if you have any
educational<00:02:56.280> software<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.819> used<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> using

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
educational software you used to using

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.600 
educational software you used to using
this<00:02:57.930> works<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.650> automatically<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.430> this

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
this works with it automatically so this

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.569 
this works with it automatically so this
is<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.840> physics<00:03:00.840> simulation<00:03:01.440> software<00:03:02.190> written

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
is a physics simulation software written

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.300 
is a physics simulation software written
by<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:03.140> graduate<00:03:04.140> student<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.680> Sweden<00:03:05.190> I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
by a graduate student in Sweden I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.830 
by a graduate student in Sweden I
believe<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.849> what<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.480> does<00:03:06.629> is<00:03:06.810> it

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
believe and what it does is it

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.680 
believe and what it does is it
interprets<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:07.530> mouse<00:03:07.890> gestures<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
interprets your mouse gestures and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.319 
interprets your mouse gestures and
enters<00:03:09.690> them<00:03:09.900> into<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> physics<00:03:10.829> simulation<00:03:11.400> so

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
enters them into a physics simulation so

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.050 
enters them into a physics simulation so
we<00:03:12.569> can<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:13.349> little<00:03:13.560> experiments<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.370> stack

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
we can do little experiments like stack

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.860 
we can do little experiments like stack
up<00:03:15.239> some<00:03:15.420> blocks<00:03:16.250> draw<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> ramp<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.870> then

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
up some blocks draw a ramp and then

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.629 
up some blocks draw a ramp and then
create<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> ball<00:03:19.850> there<00:03:20.850> we<00:03:20.910> go<00:03:21.030> oh<00:03:22.459> here<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.489> go

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
create a ball there we go oh here we go

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.610 
create a ball there we go oh here we go
and<00:03:23.940> then<00:03:24.120> at<00:03:24.269> all<00:03:24.389> you<00:03:25.109> know<00:03:25.170> do<00:03:25.380> all<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
and then at all you know do all the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.620 
and then at all you know do all the
right<00:03:25.769> things<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.910> other<00:03:30.060> nice<00:03:30.299> thing<00:03:30.329> is

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
right things the other nice thing is

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.800 
right things the other nice thing is
that<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.579> camera<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.510> can

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
that it's a it's a camera so it can

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.050 
that it's a it's a camera so it can
actually<00:03:34.079> see<00:03:34.230> multiple<00:03:34.650> points<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.730> if<00:03:35.819> i<00:03:35.910> use

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
actually see multiple points so if i use

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.800 
actually see multiple points so if i use
two<00:03:36.269> pens<00:03:36.510> there's<00:03:37.470> actually<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.859> multi-touch

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
two pens there's actually a multi-touch

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.729 
two pens there's actually a multi-touch
interactive<00:03:39.810> system<00:03:40.109> as<00:03:40.200> well<00:03:40.349> where<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.590> can

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
interactive system as well where I can

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.129 
interactive system as well where I can
grab<00:03:40.919> both<00:03:41.609> ends<00:03:41.849> of<00:03:42.030> this<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.359> use<00:03:42.450> multiple

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
grab both ends of this and use multiple

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.930 
grab both ends of this and use multiple
hands<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:44.099> supports<00:03:44.430> up<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.549> four<00:03:44.819> people

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
hands and it supports up to four people

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.750 
hands and it supports up to four people
now<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.810> nice<00:03:46.019> thing<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.919> works

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
now the nice thing is that this works

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.220 
now the nice thing is that this works
it's<00:03:48.150> not<00:03:48.299> going<00:03:48.419> to<00:03:48.510> be<00:03:48.569> quite<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:48.989> good<00:03:49.169> as

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
it's not going to be quite as good as

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.780 
it's not going to be quite as good as
the<00:03:49.500> high-end<00:03:49.799> commercial<00:03:50.010> systems<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.639> see

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
the high-end commercial systems you see

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.809 
the high-end commercial systems you see
on<00:03:50.940> sale<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:51.419> it's<00:03:51.569> actually<00:03:51.840> pretty<00:03:52.410> good

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
on sale but it's actually pretty good

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.849 
on sale but it's actually pretty good
for<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> price<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.930> software<00:03:55.319> on<00:03:55.590> my

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
the students learn a little bit of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.890 
the students learn a little bit of
electronics<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.549> their<00:04:18.150> school<00:04:18.419> gets<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.780> few

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
electronics and their school gets a few

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.589 
electronics and their school gets a few
dozen<00:04:19.049> electronic<00:04:19.739> whiteboards<00:04:20.359> now<00:04:21.359> for<00:04:21.539> the

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
dozen electronic whiteboards now for the

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.209 
dozen electronic whiteboards now for the
second<00:04:21.900> project<00:04:22.019> i<00:04:22.320> need<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.590> cameraman<00:04:22.979> to

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
second project i need the cameraman to

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.400 
second project i need the cameraman to
come<00:04:23.370> up<00:04:23.490> here

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
come up here

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.150 
come up here
and<00:04:24.500> we<00:04:25.190> have<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.730> Wii<00:04:26.240> Remote<00:04:26.860> attached<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
and we have a Wii Remote attached to the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.400 
and we have a Wii Remote attached to the
bottom<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.520> this<00:04:28.610> TV<00:04:29.050> pointing<00:04:30.050> outward

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
bottom of this TV pointing outward

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.990 
bottom of this TV pointing outward
outwards<00:04:31.100> instead<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.430> pointing<00:04:31.550> toward<00:04:31.970> the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
outwards instead of pointing toward the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.140 
outwards instead of pointing toward the
TV<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:34.520> reason<00:04:34.730> why<00:04:34.850> this<00:04:34.910> is

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
TV and the reason why this is

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.660 
TV and the reason why this is
interesting<00:04:35.300> is<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.320> camera<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.950> see<00:04:37.190> a

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
interesting is that the camera can see a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.670 
interesting is that the camera can see a
little<00:04:38.060> unit<00:04:38.540> i<00:04:38.630> have<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.930> top<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.230> this<00:04:39.290> camera

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
little unit i have on top of this camera

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.040 
little unit i have on top of this camera
that<00:04:39.860> contains<00:04:40.220> two<00:04:40.880> similar<00:04:41.540> infrared

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
that contains two similar infrared

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.620 
that contains two similar infrared
emitters<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.830> those<00:04:43.340> two<00:04:43.550> dots<00:04:43.760> give<00:04:44.420> the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
emitters and those two dots give the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.570 
emitters and those two dots give the
can't<00:04:44.840> give<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.230> computer<00:04:45.620> an<00:04:45.860> approximation

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
can't give the computer an approximation

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.060 
can't give the computer an approximation
of<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.000> camera<00:04:47.480> location<00:04:47.960> so<00:04:48.500> if<00:04:48.680> we<00:04:48.770> move

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
of the camera location so if we move

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.310 
of the camera location so if we move
around<00:04:49.340> if<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:49.940> camera<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.270> move<00:04:50.540> around<00:04:50.630> you

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
around if the camera can move around you

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.020 
around if the camera can move around you
see<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:51.740> like<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:51.980> video<00:04:52.190> game<00:04:52.310> this<00:04:52.700> looks

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
see that like a video game this looks

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.780 
see that like a video game this looks
like<00:04:53.480> a<00:04:53.540> 3d<00:04:53.900> room<00:04:54.170> but<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.860> for<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.430> most<00:04:55.670> part

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
like a 3d room but it for the most part

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.730 
like a 3d room but it for the most part
the<00:04:56.060> image<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.450> pretty<00:04:56.660> flat<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.200> stays<00:04:57.440> bound

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
the image is pretty flat it stays bound

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.830 
the image is pretty flat it stays bound
to<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.070> surface<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.550> TV<00:04:58.880> but<00:04:59.630> when<00:04:59.750> we

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
to the surface of the TV but when we

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.630 
to the surface of the TV but when we
turn<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.140> head<00:05:00.320> tracking<00:05:02.320> we<00:05:03.320> go<00:05:03.550> when<00:05:04.550> the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
turn on head tracking we go when the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.640 
turn on head tracking we go when the
camera<00:05:04.880> moves<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.510> actually<00:05:05.900> gives<00:05:06.080> the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
camera moves it actually gives the

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.810 
camera moves it actually gives the
objects<00:05:07.010> on<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.190> screen<00:05:07.280> move

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
objects on the screen move

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.310 
objects on the screen move
correspondingly<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:08.960> gives<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.200> very

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
correspondingly and it gives a very

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.290 
correspondingly and it gives a very
accurate<00:05:09.620> representation<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.490> depth<00:05:11.150> in

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
accurate representation of depth in

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.300 
accurate representation of depth in
space<00:05:11.600> as<00:05:11.930> if<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.410> objects<00:05:12.770> are<00:05:12.890> really<00:05:13.100> there

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
space as if the objects are really there

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.480 
space as if the objects are really there
so<00:05:14.000> this<00:05:14.660> has<00:05:14.810> been<00:05:14.930> pretty<00:05:15.800> startling<00:05:16.280> to

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
so this has been pretty startling to

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.250 
so this has been pretty startling to
game<00:05:16.700> developers<00:05:17.180> both<00:05:17.510> hobby<00:05:17.990> and

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
game developers both hobby and

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.630 
game developers both hobby and
professional<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.040> hopefully<00:05:19.430> we'll<00:05:19.550> be<00:05:19.610> able

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
professional and hopefully we'll be able

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.670 
professional and hopefully we'll be able
to<00:05:19.820> seize<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.180> type<00:05:20.810> of<00:05:20.840> capability<00:05:21.140> in<00:05:21.560> your

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
to seize this type of capability in your

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
to seize this type of capability in your
living<00:05:21.860> room<00:05:21.980> sometime<00:05:22.580> soon<00:05:22.990> so<00:05:24.580> but<00:05:25.580> what

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
living room sometime soon so but what

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.880 
living room sometime soon so but what
actually<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:26.210> think<00:05:26.570> we<00:05:26.960> can<00:05:27.140> switch<00:05:27.440> back<00:05:27.650> to

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
actually I think we can switch back to

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:35.080 
actually I think we can switch back to
me<00:05:28.930> or<00:05:32.320> but<00:05:33.320> what<00:05:33.530> I<00:05:33.560> actually<00:05:33.680> find<00:05:34.090> almost

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
me or but what I actually find almost

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.150 
me or but what I actually find almost
more<00:05:35.510> interesting<00:05:36.050> than<00:05:36.410> either<00:05:36.650> these<00:05:36.980> two

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
more interesting than either these two

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.770 
more interesting than either these two
projects<00:05:37.610> is<00:05:37.730> how<00:05:37.850> most<00:05:38.060> people<00:05:38.420> found<00:05:38.660> out

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
projects is how most people found out

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.340 
projects is how most people found out
about<00:05:38.930> them<00:05:39.230> and<00:05:39.380> that's<00:05:39.890> through<00:05:40.130> a<00:05:40.190> YouTube

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
about them and that's through a YouTube

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.630 
about them and that's through a YouTube
service<00:05:42.350> online<00:05:42.560> video<00:05:43.010> services<00:05:43.430> like

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
service online video services like

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.670 
service online video services like
YouTube<00:05:43.850> have<00:05:44.270> really<00:05:44.480> changed<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.500> way<00:05:45.560> a

YouTube have really changed the way a
