so as a freshman civil engineer the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
so as a freshman civil engineer the
project<00:00:36.330> that<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.600> had<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.080> was<00:00:37.350> decide

project that we had to do was decide
well<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.100> had<00:00:38.190> two<00:00:38.340> options<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> which<00:00:39.630> was

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
well we had two options one of which was

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.590 
well we had two options one of which was
you<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.250> failure<00:00:41.880> project<00:00:42.390> which<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you could do a failure project which is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.290 
you could do a failure project which is
you<00:00:42.750> choose<00:00:43.160> any<00:00:44.160> type<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.430> engineering

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you choose any type of engineering

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.640 
you choose any type of engineering
failure<00:00:45.630> that's<00:00:45.780> happened<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.080> the<00:00:46.140> past<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
failure that's happened in the past and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.710 
failure that's happened in the past and
you<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.830> research<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.820> there's

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
you do research on it and there's

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.060 
you do research on it and there's
another<00:00:48.900> option<00:00:49.140> where<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.560> build<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.860> bridge

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
another option where you build a bridge

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.030 
another option where you build a bridge
on<00:00:50.700> scale<00:00:50.940> down<00:00:51.120> model<00:00:51.330> of<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.630> bridge<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> my

on scale down model of a bridge and my

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.980 
on scale down model of a bridge and my
group<00:00:53.280> chose<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.150> building<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
group chose to go with building the

group chose to go with building the
bridge<00:00:55.200> and<00:00:55.550> some<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> requirements<00:00:56.790> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bridge and some of the requirements you

bridge and some of the requirements you
have<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.540> have<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.750> make<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.080> four<00:00:58.350> feet<00:00:58.560> long

has to be a foot wide no more than ten
inches<00:01:01.920> tall<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.580> you<00:01:03.330> have<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:03.810> if

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
inches tall and you have to see how if

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260 
inches tall and you have to see how if
you<00:01:04.620> can<00:01:04.770> make<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:04.980> hold<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.940> much<00:01:06.060> weight<00:01:06.240> as

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you can make it hold as much weight as

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.050 
you can make it hold as much weight as
possible<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> has<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.710> also<00:01:08.280> weigh<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
possible but it has to also weigh the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
possible but it has to also weigh the
least<00:01:09.240> um<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.900> key<00:01:10.050> takeaways<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
least um some key takeaways from the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
least um some key takeaways from the
project<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.729> group<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.270> did

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
project that my group and I did

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.750 
project that my group and I did
definitely<00:01:13.410> was<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.790> how<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> act<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
definitely was just how to act and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.690 
definitely was just how to act and
conduct<00:01:17.760> yourself<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.509> professional

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
conduct yourself as a professional

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
conduct yourself as a professional
always<00:01:20.700> uphold<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.690> code<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.110> ethics<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
always uphold the code of ethics and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
always uphold the code of ethics and
just<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.880> means<00:01:23.910> and<00:01:24.660> what<00:01:24.810> your

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
just really what it means and what your

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
just really what it means and what your
responsibilities<00:01:25.770> are<00:01:26.009> after<00:01:26.580> college<00:01:27.060> when

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
responsibilities are after college when

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
responsibilities are after college when
you're<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:27.660> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> field<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.490> we

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you're actually in the field you know we

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
you're actually in the field you know we
do<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:29.910> these<00:01:30.330> little<00:01:30.630> projects<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.440> it's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
do all these little projects and it's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.140 
do all these little projects and it's
you<00:01:31.800> know<00:01:31.830> funny<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> bridges<00:01:32.759> break

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
you know funny that the bridges break

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.570 
you know funny that the bridges break
and<00:01:33.360> everything<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:34.050> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.710> real<00:01:34.890> world<00:01:35.190> you

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
and everything but in the real world you

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.859 
and everything but in the real world you
know<00:01:35.700> you're<00:01:35.910> really<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
know you're really going to have to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.500 
know you're really going to have to
design<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.710> structure<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.490> won't<00:01:38.970> fail<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
design a structure that won't fail and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.480 
design a structure that won't fail and
you're<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.140> positive<00:01:40.860> but

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you're gonna have to be positive but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.450 
you're gonna have to be positive but
safe<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.390> public<00:01:42.960> use<00:01:43.230> I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
safe for public use I think that the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
safe for public use I think that the
students<00:01:45.300> are<00:01:45.860> much<00:01:46.860> more<00:01:46.920> engaged<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:49.500> their

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
students are much more engaged in their

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.240 
students are much more engaged in their
career<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.760> terms<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.800> what<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
career in terms of what is it that I

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.570 
career in terms of what is it that I
want<00:01:53.370> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.870> they<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.440> their<00:01:55.650> analysis

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
want to do when they do their analysis

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.219 
want to do when they do their analysis
in<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.510> classroom<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:59.540> the<00:02:00.540> results<00:02:01.080> are

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
in in the classroom they the results are

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.210 
in in the classroom they the results are
just<00:02:01.409> numbers<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.370> they<00:02:02.850> don't<00:02:03.150> necessarily

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
just numbers and they don't necessarily

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.580 
just numbers and they don't necessarily
recognize<00:02:05.220> what<00:02:05.850> those<00:02:06.060> numbers<00:02:06.390> mean<00:02:06.630> when

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
recognize what those numbers mean when

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.460 
recognize what those numbers mean when
they<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:07.860> build<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.760> and<00:02:08.940> test<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.540> then

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
they actually build it and test it then

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.990 
they actually build it and test it then
they<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.799> an<00:02:13.920> idea<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
they can see and get an idea of the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.890 
they can see and get an idea of the
magnitude<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.989> things<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:17.519> know<00:02:17.670> well<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.510> my

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
magnitude of things you know well is my

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.590 
magnitude of things you know well is my
bridge<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> hold<00:02:20.000> 120<00:02:21.000> pounds

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
bridge really going to hold 120 pounds

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.070 
bridge really going to hold 120 pounds
it<00:02:21.900> does<00:02:22.440> connect<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.880> numbers<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.660> something

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
it does connect the numbers to something

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080 
it does connect the numbers to something
real

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
real
