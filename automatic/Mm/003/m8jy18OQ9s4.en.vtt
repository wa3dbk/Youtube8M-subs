00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.889
 so i am axel of a little me 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.699
 am founder and manager i am 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.010
 today at air 2 to the new volvo ultra 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.650
 present 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.150
 starting with the teacher of course 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.670
 again high quality and also very 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 exclusive fiber materials used 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 We also put increased revenue 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 matrix system one around at the thin one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.620
 Wall thicknesses also the festivities 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.160
 really guarantee 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 There is also a special for the ultra 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 exclusive fork from trm also 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.660
 look at other materials and matrix 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.149
 Systems relies on easier 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.219
 but at the same time stiffness 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.670
 and comfort and safety keep you 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.800
 can 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.710
 we also have the whole thing 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.670
 coating system changed again 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.220
 we save on the coating 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.010
 compared to the standard almost ten grams 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.200
 also expresses itself by a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.630
 The roughness of the frame is math 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.870
 are very high quality and noble too 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.140
 as a result, in total, have made it 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.960
 to reduce the court significantly so 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.910
 we are now at frame size it 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.910
 just below 600 grams and at the frame 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.610
 Set consisting of the frame of 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.340
 clanchef tax warehouse and the fork 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.400
 we are above all sizes below 1000 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.400
 gram 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.440
 it is important in this framework it acts 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.470
 really an absolutely exclusive 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.330
 product we are due to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.270
 maximum production times in the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.390
 month a quantity of five frames 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.890
 produce sets 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.650
 more would just be a loss of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.330
 quality and mechanical values 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.010
 to pull oneself 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.600
 So every frame is as such 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.600
 really an absolutely unique
