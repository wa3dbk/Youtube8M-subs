00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
him cuz we couldn't think big enough and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.889 
him cuz we couldn't think big enough and
I<00:01:40.530> said<00:01:41.039> we<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.390> run<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.320> world<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:44.689> if<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
is not real black pride then what is it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
is not real black pride then what is it
to<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.439> proud<00:01:49.710> enough<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.880> can

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
handle everything that is private well I

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.950 
handle everything that is private well I
think<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:57.030> think<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.600> many

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
think that you know I think as many

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.529 
think that you know I think as many
voices<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.369> saying<00:02:00.179> there's

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
voices as we can have saying there's

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.859 
voices as we can have saying there's
more<00:02:00.600> than<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.799> black<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:03.450> so

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
more than one way to be black it's so

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.620
