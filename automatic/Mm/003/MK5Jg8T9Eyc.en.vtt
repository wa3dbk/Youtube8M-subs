00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
drag the feet up and down or at least

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.890 
drag the feet up and down or at least
four<00:01:07.830> forward<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.700> backwards<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.360> but

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
four forward or backwards actually but

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.210 
four forward or backwards actually but
this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.070> happens<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.049> can<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
this is what happens you can go to this

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.840 
this is what happens you can go to this
height<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.100> height<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.520> think

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
height and to this height and I think

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.780 
height and to this height and I think
this<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.770> amazing<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.189> been<00:01:23.369> waiting<00:01:23.759> for

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
this is amazing I have been waiting for

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.450 
this is amazing I have been waiting for
this<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.750> maybe<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> heights<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this but maybe some of the heights are a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
this but maybe some of the heights are a
little<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.820> too<00:01:27.000> extreme<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.630> me<00:01:28.049> because

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
little bit too extreme for me because

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.480 
little bit too extreme for me because
this<00:01:29.850> happens<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.460> something<00:01:32.460> like

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this happens now it's not something like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
this happens now it's not something like
really<00:01:33.420> over<00:01:34.290> dramatic<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:36.150> kind<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
really over dramatic this kind of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
really over dramatic this kind of
doesn't<00:01:36.900> look<00:01:37.259> normal<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> me<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.100> would<00:01:39.030> prefer

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
doesn't look normal to me I would prefer

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630 
doesn't look normal to me I would prefer
something<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.409> bit<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.640> normal

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
something a little bit more normal

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.170 
something a little bit more normal
looking<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.439> first<00:01:43.770> version<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180

have to worry about the clothing getting
messed<00:03:17.099> up<00:03:17.280> except<00:03:18.000> for<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.420> teen<00:03:18.690> Sims<00:03:19.129> you

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
messed up except for the teen Sims you

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.460 
messed up except for the teen Sims you
see<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.940> what<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> mean<00:03:21.390> but<00:03:22.110> otherwise

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
see this is what I mean but otherwise

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.339 
see this is what I mean but otherwise
everything<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.760> ok<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.260> to

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
everything is ok so you don't have to

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.080 
everything is ok so you don't have to
worry<00:03:25.530> now<00:03:25.620> we're<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.099> live<00:03:26.400> mode<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.940> we<00:03:27.060> can

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
worry now we're in live mode and we can

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.680 
worry now we're in live mode and we can
check<00:03:27.450> out<00:03:27.690> how<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.140> height<00:03:28.680> works<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:30.269> we

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
check out how the height works so we

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.229 
check out how the height works so we
should<00:03:31.019> probably<00:03:32.989> see<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.230> difference<00:03:35.239> so

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
should probably see the difference so

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.320 
should probably see the difference so
this<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.810> short<00:03:37.230> sim<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.040> toss<00:03:38.280> them<00:03:38.670> in

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
this is a short sim and the toss them in

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.170 
this is a short sim and the toss them in
live<00:03:39.720> mode<00:03:39.930> there<00:03:40.440> isn't<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:41.040> huge<00:03:41.849> difference

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
live mode there isn't a huge difference

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.990 
live mode there isn't a huge difference
but<00:03:43.080> there<00:03:43.290> still<00:03:43.409> is<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:44.129> difference<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.940> I

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
but there still is a difference and I

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.330 
but there still is a difference and I
think<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:45.720> height<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.349> perfect<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:47.069> teen

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
think this height is perfect for teen

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.690 
think this height is perfect for teen
Sims<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:48.209> would<00:03:49.110> definitely<00:03:49.739> use<00:03:49.769> this<00:03:50.400> height

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
Sims I would definitely use this height

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.179 
Sims I would definitely use this height

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.399 
made and not just for this believe me I

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
but I think for the height and the

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.640 
but I think for the height and the
lounge<00:06:59.760> chairs<00:07:00.210> it's<00:07:00.810> all<00:07:01.050> worth<00:07:01.260> it

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
lounge chairs it's all worth it

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.220 
lounge chairs it's all worth it
it<00:07:01.830> is<00:07:02.360> now<00:07:03.360> if<00:07:03.870> if<00:07:04.170> we<00:07:05.130> get<00:07:05.370> loungers<00:07:06.000> with<00:07:06.450> the

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
it is now if if we get loungers with the

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.070 
it is now if if we get loungers with the
next<00:07:07.950> game<00:07:08.130> pack<00:07:08.430> I<00:07:08.670> will<00:07:08.970> not<00:07:09.150> use<00:07:09.540> this<00:07:09.780> mod

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
next game pack I will not use this mod

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.710 
next game pack I will not use this mod
but<00:07:10.440> for<00:07:10.980> the<00:07:11.160> height<00:07:11.370> I<00:07:11.640> definitely<00:07:12.270> will<00:07:12.450> and

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
but for the height I definitely will and

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720 
but for the height I definitely will and
I<00:07:12.840> believe<00:07:13.260> that<00:07:13.890> there<00:07:14.220> will<00:07:14.370> be<00:07:14.430> new

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.570 
I believe that there will be new
versions<00:07:15.210> of<00:07:15.360> this<00:07:15.720> and<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.830> hips<00:07:17.100> will<00:07:17.430> be

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
versions of this and the hips will be

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.240 
versions of this and the hips will be
fixed<00:07:18.030> hopefully<00:07:18.590> not<00:07:19.590> saying<00:07:19.920> that<00:07:20.040> it<00:07:20.130> will

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
fixed hopefully not saying that it will

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.740 
fixed hopefully not saying that it will
