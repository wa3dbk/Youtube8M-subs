00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
objective that you actually have to hold

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.010

down<00:00:56.399> we'll<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.149> how<00:00:57.300> he<00:00:57.360> does<00:00:57.660> there

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
down we'll have to see how he does there

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.830 
down we'll have to see how he does there
I<00:00:58.199> basically<00:00:59.129> rely<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.520> myself<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.480> hit<00:01:00.660> them

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
I basically rely on myself to hit them

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.399 
I basically rely on myself to hit them
once<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.949> plane<00:01:02.430> mode<00:01:03.030> rockets<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.170> then

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
once with my plane mode rockets and then

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.920 
once with my plane mode rockets and then
drop<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.700> my<00:01:05.880> neutron<00:01:06.210> assault<00:01:06.570> rifle

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
drop down use my neutron assault rifle

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.539 
drop down use my neutron assault rifle
and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.320> try<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.650> pick<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> kill<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> if

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and then try to pick up the kill and if

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
and then try to pick up the kill and if
I<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.939> succeed<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.630> am<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.140> there

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I do not succeed I am out of there

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
I do not succeed I am out of there
so<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.340> gameplay<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.820> pretty<00:01:12.180> good<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.869> not

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
so this gameplay is pretty good I'm not

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
so this gameplay is pretty good I'm not
sure<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.590> had<00:01:13.710> too<00:01:13.950> many<00:01:14.130> scouts<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:15.119> not

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
sure if they had too many scouts or not

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.140 
sure if they had too many scouts or not

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
but I pull off a pretty nice score with

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.179 
but I pull off a pretty nice score with
the<00:01:18.299> old<00:01:18.450> 16<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> oh<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> check<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.830> part

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
like to call it a spring because that's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
like to call it a spring because that's
what<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.960> looks<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.979> looks<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.220> if

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
what it looks like and it looks like if

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
what it looks like and it looks like if
you<00:01:53.520> were<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> strap<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.450> your<00:01:54.600> feet<00:01:54.780> you'd

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you were to strap it on your feet you'd

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.499 
you were to strap it on your feet you'd
walk<00:01:55.259> around<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> pogo<00:01:56.159> stick<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:57.360> then

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
walk around like a pogo stick and then

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.209 
walk around like a pogo stick and then
right<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:57.990> you'll<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.649> pick<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.009> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
believe a kill with my turret that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
believe a kill with my turret that
doesn't<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.430> taken<00:02:02.670> now<00:02:02.729> maybe<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
doesn't get taken now maybe not but the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
doesn't get taken now maybe not but the
sentries<00:02:04.200> they're<00:02:04.560> decent<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
they actually are very cool because they

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.410

the<00:02:18.750> kind<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.019> cool<00:02:19.200> new<00:02:19.410> feature<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.550> am

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the kind of cool new feature and I am

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.150 
the kind of cool new feature and I am
constantly<00:02:21.300> looking<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.349> health<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:23.010> this

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
constantly looking for health in this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.720 
constantly looking for health in this
map<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:23.910> I'm<00:02:24.330> out<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:25.050> milk<00:02:25.950> every<00:02:26.190> time

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
map it's like I'm out of milk every time

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.550 
map it's like I'm out of milk every time
I<00:02:26.760> go<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.480> at<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.720> refrigerator<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.319> feels

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
I go for it at the refrigerator it feels

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470 
I go for it at the refrigerator it feels
like<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.730> don't<00:02:29.790> know<00:02:29.940> why<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.209> think

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
like that and I don't know why I think

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.180 
like that and I don't know why I think
there<00:02:30.930> needs<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.230> more<00:02:31.470> health<00:02:31.739> cubes<00:02:32.069> on

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
there needs to be more health cubes on

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.339 
there needs to be more health cubes on
these<00:02:32.400> maps<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.880> they<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:33.569> pretty<00:02:33.959> big<00:02:34.140> Maps

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
these maps and they are pretty big Maps

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.199 
these maps and they are pretty big Maps
as<00:02:34.560> well<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.489> I'm<00:02:35.580> kind<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.819> curious<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.180> see

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
as well so I'm kind of curious to see

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.360 
as well so I'm kind of curious to see
how<00:02:36.959> big<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> other<00:02:37.470> maps<00:02:37.860> will<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.069> I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
how big the other maps will be I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.680 
how big the other maps will be I
wouldn't<00:02:38.670> mind<00:02:38.910> seeing<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.239> little<00:02:39.480> bit<00:02:39.599> of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
wouldn't mind seeing a little bit of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
wouldn't mind seeing a little bit of
smaller<00:02:39.959> maps<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.860> smaller<00:02:41.160> mass<00:02:41.459> you're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
smaller maps but the smaller mass you're

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.070 
smaller maps but the smaller mass you're
gonna<00:02:41.849> get<00:02:42.030> more<00:02:42.239> team<00:02:42.540> shots<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:42.989> you're

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
gonna get more team shots and you're

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.199 
gonna get more team shots and you're
gonna<00:02:43.200> die<00:02:43.500> even<00:02:43.980> quicker<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:44.549> how<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
gonna die even quicker for how the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.970 
gonna die even quicker for how the
damage<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.810> set<00:02:46.049> up<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.410> game<00:02:46.650> thus<00:02:46.950> far

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980

that is where he is at his best those

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.229 
that is where he is at his best those
big<00:04:12.329> guns<00:04:12.900> those<00:04:13.590> missiles<00:04:14.340> those<00:04:14.790> riot

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
big guns those missiles those riot

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.789 
big guns those missiles those riot
cannons<00:04:15.630> are<00:04:15.780> gonna<00:04:15.989> shoot<00:04:16.349> you<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.650> hit<00:04:16.769> you

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
cannons are gonna shoot you and hit you

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.099 
cannons are gonna shoot you and hit you
more<00:04:17.160> if<00:04:17.430> you're<00:04:17.609> at<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> downward<00:04:18.329> angle<00:04:18.539> or<00:04:19.079> a

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
more if you're at a downward angle or a

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.140 
more if you're at a downward angle or a
slope<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> definitely<00:04:20.609> recommend<00:04:20.849> hitting

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
slope so I definitely recommend hitting

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.170 
slope so I definitely recommend hitting
them<00:04:21.810> from<00:04:22.079> up<00:04:22.260> high<00:04:22.470> if<00:04:22.710> possible<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.610> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
them from up high if possible and that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.850 
them from up high if possible and that
is<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.599> way<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.810> play<00:04:25.260> them<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.650> should

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
is the way to play them and you should

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.930 
is the way to play them and you should
be<00:04:25.950> able<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.190> pick<00:04:26.490> and

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
be able to pick and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.760 
be able to pick and
the<00:04:27.150> way<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.360> fight<00:04:27.750> destroyers<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.500> this

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
the way to fight destroyers in this

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.400 
the way to fight destroyers in this
unless<00:04:29.220> they<00:04:29.580> get<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.790> better<00:04:30.180> weapon<00:04:30.660> overall

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
unless they get a better weapon overall

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.620 
unless they get a better weapon overall
but<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.340> feel<00:04:32.970> like<00:04:33.120> I'm<00:04:33.270> playing<00:04:33.480> the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
but I feel like I'm playing the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.750 
but I feel like I'm playing the
scientist<00:04:34.050> pretty<00:04:34.290> smart<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:34.890> not<00:04:35.490> as

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
scientist pretty smart in this not as

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.430 
scientist pretty smart in this not as
hectic<00:04:36.120> as<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.600> usually<00:04:36.870> would<00:04:37.080> play<00:04:37.320> I'm

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
hectic as I usually would play I'm

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.990 
hectic as I usually would play I'm
usually<00:04:37.800> I'd<00:04:37.890> be<00:04:37.920> all<00:04:38.220> over<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.580> place<00:04:38.700> going

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
usually I'd be all over the place going

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.260 
usually I'd be all over the place going
just<00:04:39.330> eight<00:04:39.750> going<00:04:40.380> crazy<00:04:40.860> going<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> ham<00:04:41.760> and
