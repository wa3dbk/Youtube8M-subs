add<00:01:55.530> another<00:01:55.560> stripe<00:01:56.460> line<00:01:56.820> down<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.270> side

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
add another stripe line down the side

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.600 
add another stripe line down the side
and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.080> I'm<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> keep<00:01:58.560> building<00:01:58.830> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and then I'm going to keep building so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.210 
and then I'm going to keep building so
if<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.910> notice<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.300> hexes<00:02:01.080> I'm<00:02:01.530> trying<00:02:01.980> to

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
if you notice the hexes I'm trying to

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.160 
if you notice the hexes I'm trying to
position<00:02:02.880> them<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.480> they<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.930> of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
position them so that they kind of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.530 
position them so that they kind of
interlock<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.370> each<00:02:05.460> other<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.210> they're<00:02:06.390> not

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
interlock to each other but they're not

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.950 
interlock to each other but they're not
completely<00:02:07.140> touching<00:02:08.130> or<00:02:08.520> overlapping<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
completely touching or overlapping you

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.870 
completely touching or overlapping you
can<00:02:10.110> really<00:02:10.380> push<00:02:10.649> them<00:02:10.860> together<00:02:11.070> as<00:02:11.520> tight

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
can really push them together as tight

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.030 
can really push them together as tight
as<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.270> them<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.860> leave<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
as you want them to be I like to leave a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.190 
as you want them to be I like to leave a
little<00:02:14.280> space<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.210> read<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.630> or<00:02:15.900> move<00:02:16.080> it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
little space so I can read it or move it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.190 
little space so I can read it or move it
around<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.890> need<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.300> patterns<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
around if I need to so the patterns that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.410 
around if I need to so the patterns that
I'm<00:02:19.320> actually<00:02:19.500> making<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.490> supposed<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> be

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
I'm actually making it's supposed to be

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.830 
I'm actually making it's supposed to be
a<00:02:21.720> downward<00:02:22.440> C<00:02:23.130> shape<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.270> that's<00:02:24.510> how<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
a downward C shape so that's how you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.470 
a downward C shape so that's how you
kind<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.740> see<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.880> look<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.209> pink

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
kind of see like if you look at the pink

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.810 
kind of see like if you look at the pink
for<00:02:27.690> example<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.770> kind<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.130> going<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.640> one

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
for example it's kind of going in one

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.710 
for example it's kind of going in one
direction

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
direction

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.750 
direction
it's<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.230> slanted<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.070> not<00:02:32.280> straight

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
it's like slanted it's not straight

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.760 
it's like slanted it's not straight
across<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.270> nail<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.690> then<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> other

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
across the nail and then on the other

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.790 
across the nail and then on the other
half<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.310> nail<00:02:35.490> I'm<00:02:35.790> gonna<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.390> going<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
half the nail I'm gonna do it going the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.460 
half the nail I'm gonna do it going the
same<00:02:38.040> downwards<00:02:38.730> direction<00:02:39.270> will<00:02:39.959> actually

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
same downwards direction will actually

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.920 
same downwards direction will actually
upwards<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.760> an<00:02:41.850> angle<00:02:42.150> we're<00:02:42.450> looking<00:02:42.480> at

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
upwards with an angle we're looking at

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.199 
upwards with an angle we're looking at
it<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:43.350> whatever<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.220> know<00:02:44.310> what<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.459> mean<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
it but whatever you know what I mean the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.270 
it but whatever you know what I mean the
design<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.410> kind<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.830> reminds

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
design I was going for kind of reminds

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.920 
design I was going for kind of reminds
me<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.520> those<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.880> friendship<00:02:48.390> bracelets

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
me of those like friendship bracelets

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.600 
me of those like friendship bracelets
that<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> used<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.770> make<00:02:49.950> with<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.220> bunch<00:02:50.459> of

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
that I used to make with a bunch of

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.630 
that I used to make with a bunch of
knots<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.239> like<00:02:51.450> grade<00:02:51.989> 7<00:02:52.590> at<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:53.070> sleepover

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
knots in like grade 7 at like sleepover

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.820 
knots in like grade 7 at like sleepover
camp<00:02:53.910> those<00:02:54.239> were<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> good<00:02:54.750> old<00:02:54.810> days<00:02:55.050> but

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
camp those were the good old days but

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.770 
camp those were the good old days but
now<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.100> do<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.489> with<00:02:56.760> glitter<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.390> our<00:02:57.570> nails

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
now we do it with glitter on our nails

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.750 
now we do it with glitter on our nails
which<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.500> much<00:02:58.680> more<00:02:58.890> fun<00:02:59.130> why<00:02:59.340> didn't<00:02:59.700> I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
which is so much more fun why didn't I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.509 
which is so much more fun why didn't I
do<00:02:59.820> this<00:02:59.970> when<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> was<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.780> grade<00:03:00.900> 7<00:03:01.290> why<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
do this when I was in grade 7 why the

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.310 
do this when I was in grade 7 why the
sides<00:03:02.820> are<00:03:03.060> always<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.300> little<00:03:03.480> tricky<00:03:03.780> because

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
sides are always a little tricky because

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.680 
sides are always a little tricky because
if<00:03:04.500> you're<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.830> me<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> human<00:03:05.820> our<00:03:06.060> cuticles

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
if you're like me and human our cuticles

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.900 
if you're like me and human our cuticles
are<00:03:06.930> not<00:03:07.170> hexagon<00:03:07.500> shaped<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.640> you're<00:03:08.790> going

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
are not hexagon shaped so you're going

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.850 
are not hexagon shaped so you're going
to<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.570> move<00:03:09.989> them<00:03:10.260> around<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
to have to like move them around and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.600 
to have to like move them around and
make<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.100> work

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
make it work

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.789 
make it work
all<00:03:11.700> right<00:03:12.060> first<00:03:12.630> half<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.989> nails<00:03:13.170> done<00:03:13.500> and

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
all right first half the nails done and

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.210 
all right first half the nails done and
now<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> second<00:03:14.820> half<00:03:14.850> only<00:03:16.040> 17<00:03:17.040> more

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
now we do the second half only 17 more

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:31.000 
now we do the second half only 17 more
hours<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.760> go

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.770 

all<00:03:31.550> right<00:03:31.730> now<00:03:31.849> this<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.390> tricky<00:03:32.750> part

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
all right now this is the tricky part

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.720 
all right now this is the tricky part
you<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.620> how<00:03:33.739> at<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.980> bottom<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.430> my<00:03:34.550> nail

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
you see how at the bottom of my nail

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.910 
you see how at the bottom of my nail
there's<00:03:35.030> still<00:03:35.239> some<00:03:35.450> blue<00:03:35.720> space<00:03:36.080> but<00:03:36.709> an

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
there's still some blue space but an

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.220 
there's still some blue space but an
entire<00:03:37.370> hexagon<00:03:38.060> glitter<00:03:38.330> wouldn't<00:03:38.659> fit<00:03:38.900> I

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
entire hexagon glitter wouldn't fit I

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.009 
entire hexagon glitter wouldn't fit I
take<00:03:40.159> some<00:03:40.400> what<00:03:40.819> they<00:03:40.940> call<00:03:41.150> cuticle<00:03:41.720> nippers

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
take some what they call cuticle nippers

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.410 
take some what they call cuticle nippers
but<00:03:42.409> I<00:03:42.620> don't<00:03:42.769> actually<00:03:43.010> ever<00:03:43.459> use<00:03:43.970> these<00:03:44.180> to

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
but I don't actually ever use these to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.449 
but I don't actually ever use these to
cut<00:03:44.629> my<00:03:44.810> cuticles<00:03:45.290> do<00:03:45.500> not<00:03:45.709> cut<00:03:46.069> your<00:03:46.220> cuticles

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
cut my cuticles do not cut your cuticles

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.360
