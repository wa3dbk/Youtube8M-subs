00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.029
 am typing 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.530
 my son is filming there is 9 years old 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.290
 old 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.480
 i don't know how the stable that is in 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.070
 I have to say about a hundred 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.590
 Knee-beers are also called pegs 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.120
 called or New Year's rolls 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.119
 I made a batter from this 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.680
 500 grams of flour 5 enough sugar 1 bag 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.750
 vanilla sugar 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.949
 way together then you do it 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 two eggs through 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.810
 and half a liter of water settle there briefly 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.239
 mix well and finally a packet of 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.380
 250 grams cooled 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.380
 melted butter in it 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.210
 if you have done that you can 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.620
 device on I put it on position 4 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.000
 furthermore I use for rolling and 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 cutting board a ladle and a spatula 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.620
 for him to get mine out of the pan 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.940
 device I have added a kitchen timer 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.340
 then does not indicate when the chickens 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.370
 be ready and cut it on position 4 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.050
 does about a ride in the pan and me 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.580
 have another in baking sheet with one 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.550
 tea towel around it 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.870
 for cooling the chickens as 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.119
 I you one starts too fast you can 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.670
 say well do one panic 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.020
 roll up and then the follows with wax in the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.570
 pan 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.240
 currently i just do the first on the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.280
 on my plate lay say 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.640
 new batter in the pan and then the second 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 equalize fixed and then rollers 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.360
 with me it just depends on how fast you are 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.520
 hence are and how the wallpaper 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.810
 skill you have in it forge two 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.670
 is it even easier than you put 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.360
 the pan a little faster 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.310
 and then you can go through with it 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.410
 this is ready so I put it first 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.110
 I'm doing new on my shelf in between 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:55.720
 batter in the bin and I mean 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.880
 briefly busy job you turn on I go 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.890
 i trained rotterdammers 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.740
 If you were already running fast, your husband can no longer 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.479
 roll up very briefly to pressure on it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.710
 end 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.060
 thank you you know that look stuck 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.759
 sit still 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.140
 ladle is still lit. 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.090
 have to cool it off on a ball now 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.799
 they just pack through 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.870
 he now needs about 40 seconds and more 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.849
 then the next little cut is me now 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.689
 eat it with whipped cream tasty you book 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.760
 would eat 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.579
 I now have a lactose-free butter 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.519
 used because we precede its use 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.870
 Christmas dinner at school and unfortunately 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.310
 then an allergy child 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.720
 which you in this case so beautiful 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.519
 take it into account so that he too 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.040
 to make-up hot pan is almost ready now 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.359
 another 16 seconds 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.180
 I'll have one ready soon 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.590
 deal with so big so my next 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.870
 notice if there is still a nice one 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.909
 taking a prescription is pretty much 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.730
 usually I make half of the 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.340
 get started but otherwise you're in for a real one 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.859
 few hours to bake 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.920
 what do I must so very tasty 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.920
 say 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.590
 and one of these fine here 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.659
 keeping track of the rest within our family 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.889
 then do other things 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.889
 thank you well push the block 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.980
 you can also taste them as a funnel 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.260
 can fold the half moons in half 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.790
 can think of all kinds of ways how you like them 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.530
 goes on a roll 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.360
 you still like the old-fashioned method 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.490
 we made these things from home 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.930
 always been an open albany concrete and the 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.190
 curse to it 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.990
 I don't know what their conditions are 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.940
 members do not work my parents and brother 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.810
 edition actually taken over by what 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.770
 get it every year and now 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.770

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.600
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.150
 have looked and I hope you 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.290
 enjoy baking en masse 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.290
 and already enjoy your meal 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.430
 I forget we can still show how 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.400
 I started under a date 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.750
 may I go for a bus most with a long one 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.560
 time because you are easy on the wind 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.209
 own is your saying crazy to put yours 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.680
 sorry there is still running and first 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.840
 then nothing new in the pan so 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.420
 is this one 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.080
 and browned that you still 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.280
 once 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.280
 group smoothly from the piping hot 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.870
 apples to sleep well this summer 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.370
 long dessert can be put in easily 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.910
 start to spray you slowly 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.230
 whipping cream comes as low as possible 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.000
 ultimately more expensive than a test 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.150
 do as iran leave 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.150
