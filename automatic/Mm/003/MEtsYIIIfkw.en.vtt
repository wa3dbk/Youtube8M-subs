the<00:00:11.280> piece<00:00:11.549> that<00:00:11.790> I'm<00:00:11.910> working<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.270> at<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the piece that I'm working on at the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.080 
the piece that I'm working on at the
moment<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.870> called<00:00:13.080> house<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.820> very

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
moment is called house and it's very

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.200 
moment is called house and it's very
simply<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.349> cast<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:17.099> the<00:00:17.520> inside<00:00:17.849> of<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> house

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
simply the cast of the inside of a house

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.690 
simply the cast of the inside of a house
in<00:00:18.750> concrete

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
in concrete

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.380 
in concrete
it's<00:00:20.700> a<00:00:21.440> turn-of-the-century

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
it's a turn-of-the-century

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's a turn-of-the-century
terrace<00:00:24.390> house<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.619> typical<00:00:26.490> kind<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
terrace house which is a typical kind of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.439 
terrace house which is a typical kind of
architectural<00:00:27.750> style<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:29.240> chose<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
architectural style I chose the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.869 
architectural style I chose the
particular<00:00:30.840> house<00:00:31.320> further<00:00:32.129> exactly<00:00:32.730> those

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
particular house further exactly those

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.250 
particular house further exactly those
reasons<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.019> kind<00:00:34.230> of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
reasons it's like that kind of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.880 
reasons it's like that kind of
archetypal<00:00:35.070> house<00:00:42.409> what<00:00:43.409> I'm<00:00:43.530> actually<00:00:43.710> doing

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
archetypal house what I'm actually doing

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.950 
archetypal house what I'm actually doing
is<00:00:44.489> working<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.659> the<00:00:46.559> interior<00:00:47.339> walls<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is working on the interior walls of the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
is working on the interior walls of the
house<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.559> literally<00:00:50.190> making<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.760> building

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
house and literally making a building

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
house and literally making a building
within<00:00:52.049> a<00:00:52.140> building<00:00:54.379> we're<00:00:55.379> making<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.890> piece

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
within a building we're making the piece

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.579 
within a building we're making the piece
by<00:00:56.519> building<00:00:57.119> from<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> basement<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.080> so

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
by building from the basement up so

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.890 
by building from the basement up so
we're<00:00:58.769> starting<00:00:58.979> with<00:00:59.280> building<00:00:59.909> concrete

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
we're starting with building concrete

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.560 
we're starting with building concrete
foundations<00:01:01.699> because<00:01:02.699> obviously<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.360> can't

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
foundations because obviously we can't

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.329 
foundations because obviously we can't
use<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.869> foundations<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> existing

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
use the foundations to the existing

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.190 
use the foundations to the existing
house<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:06.150> therefore<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> exterior

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
house because therefore the exterior

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 
house because therefore the exterior
walls<00:01:07.440> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> house<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.760> we've<00:01:08.909> laid<00:01:09.180> these

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
walls of the house so we've laid these

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.749 
walls of the house so we've laid these
foundations<00:01:10.619> we're<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.250> putting<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
foundations we're then putting on a

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.520 
foundations we're then putting on a
layer<00:01:12.149> of<00:01:12.509> white<00:01:13.500> concrete<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.259> tie

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
layer of white concrete and then we tie

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.490 
layer of white concrete and then we tie
in<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.829> metal<00:01:17.159> structure<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:18.509> holds<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in a metal structure which holds the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
in a metal structure which holds the
next<00:01:19.740> layer<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> concrete<00:01:20.490> which<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.179> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
next layer of concrete which is like a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.709 
next layer of concrete which is like a
heavy<00:01:21.509> fill<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.929> concrete<00:01:22.469> on<00:01:22.740> top<00:01:23.509> which<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.539> a

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
heavy fill of concrete on top which is a

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.300 
heavy fill of concrete on top which is a
darker<00:01:25.320> heavier<00:01:25.500> concrete<00:01:27.649> this<00:01:28.649> all<00:01:28.890> cures

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
darker heavier concrete this all cures

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.840 
darker heavier concrete this all cures
and<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:31.200> literally<00:01:32.189> take<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.520> building

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and then we literally take the building

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.289 
and then we literally take the building
off<00:01:32.969> around<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> piece<00:01:33.749> I<00:01:37.490> think<00:01:38.490> house<00:01:38.939> will

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
off around the piece I think house will

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.480 
off around the piece I think house will
have<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:39.570> Muslim<00:01:40.229> quality<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.039> also<00:01:41.189> think

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
have a Muslim quality but I also think

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.190 
have a Muslim quality but I also think
it<00:01:41.640> might<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.570> sort<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it might be a little like a sort of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.700 
it might be a little like a sort of
fossil<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:43.859> something<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.520> been

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
fossil or something that's been

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.370 
fossil or something that's been
excavated<00:01:47.329> it's<00:01:48.329> very<00:01:48.659> difficult<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.229> talk

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
excavated it's very difficult to talk

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.809 
excavated it's very difficult to talk
about<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.829> piece<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.340> haven't<00:01:50.609> seen

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
about the piece because I haven't seen

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.370 
about the piece because I haven't seen
it<00:01:50.999> yet<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.749> the<00:01:51.810> moment<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.289> still

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
it yet you know at the moment it's still

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.290 
it yet you know at the moment it's still
all<00:01:52.920> under<00:01:53.340> brickwork

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.170 

I'm<00:01:59.110> hoping<00:01:59.770> that<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.190> will<00:02:00.370> have<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:00.850> very

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
I'm hoping that it will have this very

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.230 
I'm hoping that it will have this very
strong<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:02.770> slightly<00:02:03.400> kind<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.910> fragile

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
strong but slightly kind of fragile

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.420 
strong but slightly kind of fragile
presence<00:02:05.080> because<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.680> actual<00:02:05.980> width<00:02:06.160> of<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
presence because the actual width of the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.690 
presence because the actual width of the
piece<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.850> only<00:02:07.030> about<00:02:07.750> fourteen<00:02:08.229> foot<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
piece is only about fourteen foot the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.790 
piece is only about fourteen foot the
breadth<00:02:10.510> of<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.900> is<00:02:11.050> longer<00:02:11.440> than<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.740> and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
breadth of it is longer than that and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.140 
breadth of it is longer than that and
it's<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.820> draw<00:02:13.120> one's<00:02:14.080> attention<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it's you draw one's attention to the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.840 
it's you draw one's attention to the
very<00:02:17.050> narrow<00:02:17.350> living<00:02:18.010> spaces<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.700> we

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
very narrow living spaces that we

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.470 
very narrow living spaces that we
normally<00:02:19.500> live<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.950> may<00:02:21.100> have<00:02:21.370> a

normally live in that it may have a

normally live in that it may have a
depth<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.650> actually<00:02:24.400> quite

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
depth to it but it's actually quite

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.490 
depth to it but it's actually quite
narrow<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.040> once<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.120> two<00:02:28.480> buildings<00:02:29.080> are

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
narrow and once the two buildings are

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.680

cleared from either side of it they'll

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.740 
cleared from either side of it they'll
just<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.430> rather<00:02:33.430> strange<00:02:33.640> kind<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
just be this rather strange kind of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.480 
just be this rather strange kind of
building<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.500> standing<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.160> middle<00:02:36.430> of
