00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:10.050
 hello car mazda demio dw3w 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.920
 or ford festiva mini car if you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.340
 when turning on the heater fan 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:21.380
 there is a whistling hum or crunch means 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.400
 you need to either lubricate or change 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.519
 Well, lubricate as you yourself understand it 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 for free and if you will change 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.969
 the fan is stifling you will cost 2 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.710
 thousand rubles before this car I 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.730
 went to AvtoVAZ to AvtoVAZ fan 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 heater stands in the panel and there to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.100
 remove the fan needed to disassemble 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.059
 the whole panel here is different for 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.879
 work we need tailors scissors 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.449
 good flat screwdriver thin 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.610
 flat screwdriver Phillips screwdriver 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:14.549
 we will also need a type of head like 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.790
 screwdriver and pliers 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.619
 head under the screwdriver we need for 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.470
 order to take off 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:28.979
 the third screw that attaches the fan he 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.380
 located in a very awkward place there 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.009
 practically no screwdriver 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.530
 crawl 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.590
 I even tried the smallest cross 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.560
 it was just impossible to crawl 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.869
 buy one 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:49.720
 cross head just insert it 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.970
 screw magnetically 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.990
 and just unscrew the pliers 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.400
 pinching 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.660
 and unscrew on this car 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.830
 the heater fan is on the bottom left 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.759
 under the glove compartment for this we have to 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.140
 take off the glove box 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.120
 If by century you have lived forever 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.580
 Before this video, I showed how I shot 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.450
 glove box that is sisters goval him on 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.940
 it turned out to be wrong 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.940
 the way is much easier just squeeze 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:38.140
 him inside and he's filmed here 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 fan off the fan on 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.920
 here gives a hose 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.760
 then unscrew under the cross 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.040
 screwdriver 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:54.580
 three screws here one then we here here 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.890
 near wiring 2 and 3 there stands behind him 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.890
 then shoot this what is it 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.170
 This is how it looks 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:12.690

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.690
 this is a fixing ring 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.570
 then we take here such scissors 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:26.830
 we insert between the black case and 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:38.440
 impeller insert it from there squeeze out 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:41.730
 I have it not very dirty because I 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.640
 two years ago it was already 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.470
 to facilitate the withdrawal you can 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.350
 splash this stock with a waddish now 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.230
 we need to remove this one 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.769

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:28.240
 such a lug you take there I insert 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:31.979
 a screwdriver looks like a retainer 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.300
 then shoot here these pads 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.210

 turn off the two screws to 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.220
 get to the bottom bearing 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:30.060
 use a flat screwdriver here 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:45.370
