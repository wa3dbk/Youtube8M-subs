00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.490
 golden theater 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.919
 the prisoner of the second street 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.360
 maurizio casagrande and tosca data but 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.010
 exceptional interpreters of this 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.929
 neil simon comedy 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.350
 but let's talk with Tosca about this role of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.570
 enna and a fantastic woman was born 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.270
 why a loving patient woman who 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 bears and supports this husband 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's say that I after the first five 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.810
 minutes tosca would have already opened the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 window and would have thrown the poor 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.700
 casagrande judo on the fourteenth floor 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.969
 of the second street 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.219
 Please kindly faced was me 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.899
 that I have to bear 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 this tragedy this couple is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.489
 dramatically true is right because 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.129
 this beautiful goes through a moment of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.070
 great crisis and instead of communicating it 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 how it would be right to do it in words 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.960
 telling what is happening 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.879
 instead he dresses in a thousand neuroses of 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.289
 a thousand cosimes sell purposeful characters 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.290
 wearable because internally devastated 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.020
 from the fear of losing one's job 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.240
 lose his status as a man of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.810
 success within and printed 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.930
 also in jeans and skinny senate pig 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.610
 the Latin one note the amber color 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.640
 of the extraordinary leather of the house 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 let's say the truth that what maurizio is born 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:32.189
 jokes so he doesn't love rock much for 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:35.400
 he deserves but I can dance freely 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.430
 I admired it from just the right ones 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.290
 live got up and went to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.899
 play the battery cutolo asked for without 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.820
 having done a test I am a witness and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.380
 they just played a great piece 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.439
 orchestra so I have to say 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 having this year a rock star on stage 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.479
 but kind in life like 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.479
 education 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:03.470
 he tried beautiful maurizio that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.500
 I found absolutely no methane 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.119
 they Neapolitan to the second as much but the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.410
 big boyfriend with a woman 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:19.130
 beautiful and rightly so is the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.459
 old blog line that I like like it 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.680
 very gregorio and beyond all is a 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.680
 I know the gentleman for years 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.660
 even when I was a young gem 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.330
 he was never even allowed to do 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.130
 a joke if you have a lot of time 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.790
 is a tyrant for your beloved time 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.819
 iphone 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.630
 well the shot what you will do in the next 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.989
 months 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.900
 then in the meantime two films will come out that I have 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.600
 shot with the first is called of all 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.130
 colors with giancarlo giannini paolo 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.459
 conticini and many others very good 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.620
 actors and the latter is called not there 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.840
 two without you with belen rodriguez 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.790
 fabio Trojan and actress, and then in 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.600
 you will see on the screen but think instead 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.019
 done and makes to go out it snows but 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.970
 now there is nothing so this comes out 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.000
 film I did it with license and then instead 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.290
 I have in the pipeline instead of my film that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.829
 I will turn over packed and all that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.380
 which is always at the beginning of the year 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.390
 next shortly January but if for a 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.670
 day I had to become unemployed 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.069
 as a tutor I can also finish high school years 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.980
 subjected continuously 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.920
 I don't know finally we are an iphone 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.939
 to be conquered and not managed but 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.370
 pertinent recipe to know exact 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.719
 the actors are used to 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.719
 unemployment I think who chooses 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:48.319
 this job is a precarious one in it's 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:51.680
 one who seeks insecurity 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.780
 I had a mom who was employed by 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.389
 bank in the years when I was a kid 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.269
 so I'm talking about 67 years talking 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.829
 saw this my mother I had to go to 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.079
 pension told me maurizio but we want 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.569
 try to see if this is so I said no 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.769
 but no I can never do it 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.659
 yet I still had a place 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.340
 the mentality na and instead we are 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.310
 used to buy every job that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.349
 it actually ends could be 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.599
 the last then begins a period of 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.160
 Unemployment until the next job 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.310
 some tell me home on vacation is 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.940
 finished after that unemployed is okay 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.360
 do not do it premonition then says 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.020
 I can see the times instead you if you 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.330
 find yourself in the wifey all not so 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.580
 I am absolutely not like a lot and I 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.789
 it is very amusing because it is a very woman 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.130
 solid that tough when to roll over 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.220
 the sleeves rolled up in battle 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.300
 but always nice even when 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.220
 you know inside the couple that they are 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.380
 all these skirmishes a little funny 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.199
 they are always very earthy then in the 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.960
 in the private to commands on the producer 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:03.830
 no no no no they don't command but I am one 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:10.640
 nice fished out and he knows it 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:13.280
 I know I know no scene and people 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.260
 then Mauritius casagrande cards so 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.470
 a prisoner of the second way up 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.270
 when on October 27th here at will 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.950
 other women who are wonderful 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.520
 maurizio casagrande who is not a 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:29.180
 appointment for the fact of the videos 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.160
 beautiful I must say, however, to see 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:37.400
 crackling as they are two because they are 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:40.430
 also the Parthenopeans part in spectacular 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.560
 tv point to zero then say something 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:47.330
 this career is in the making 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.750
 of this slogan is a ratio one never is 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.100
 arrived this year at the show 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.470
 show we continue to spectacular 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.930
 drift you that we don't play a fortune 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.930
 for very light hello
