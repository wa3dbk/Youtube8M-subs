 tutorial of this flash boot program a 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.700
 program that helps us to do 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 our debut usb you talk about 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.170
 any good operating system this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 it's a portable program there's no need 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.039
 to install it and it's a very program 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 lightweight this program only weighs 18.5 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.439
 megabytes and heavy compressed then a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 little less good before starting as 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.679
 I always want to tell you if it 's okay that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.410
 make some video tutorial of a subject 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.540
 specifically just comment on this 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.930
 good video let's open our 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.230
 Program 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.640
 let's go good once we unzip it 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.710
 this folder appears with these 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.350
 archives we go to grand and cfm guide 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.480
 for those who do not know all the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.920
 computer guy is always going to be the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.680
 Interested graphic of our program 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.170
 or operating system or wii 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.590
 good hope to open this program 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 very useful since already some of the mini 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.880
 computer computers 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.860
 laptops come without a tray I decided 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.860
 divide already come alone with usb ports 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.710
 and this does not help much since 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 after economist jean I do not have no 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.680
 we have to buy what is a cities 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.700
 well here we have several options 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.540
 decided it looks says it converts converse 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.490
 bootable is divided and was usb table 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.979
 good device is the option that we are going to 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.740
 use we can convert from a 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.810
 Point made an image file after 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.150
 our operating system or we can 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.870
 do it from the tray of our 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.390
 our computer 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.000
 I do not know yet if from windows xp and pass it to 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.300
 a good usb floppy usb this is no longer 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.320
 use usb usb here what we can 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.880
 do is copy a boat speak a usb a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.659
 pendrive to another 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.229
 good in my childhood my child that state 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.060
 minimum is the ombÃº table web and divas 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.580
 we will work on this later as it is 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.239
 also a great good option let's 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.770
 USB s where it says here as I said before 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.330
 we choose between 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.330
 divide each other 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.069
 operative the image file of 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.170
 our operating system in this case 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.290
 I will do with lime and linux for 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.630
 that do not know cal and linux is a system 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.430
 operative gender linux distribution 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.860
 of good that helps us to cope ' 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.510
 Sting or computer security tests 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.610
 this operating system is very very very 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.530
 good good we give in following 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.340
 so we have two options says with 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.290
 berisso linux based on citytv debut 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.470
 civil work cable table of the second 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.390
 good since we have these options without 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.390
 fill in so that we do not all appear 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.760
 Well, here we are going to choose the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.160
 unit where our our usb is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.510
 in this case it can be here they are 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.800
 from 101 g 2 which is 8 gigabytes 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.150
 there is also the option to choose a 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.209
 image file because this is not going 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.280
 to touch let's give it here let's give it 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.440
 the next good here we can give you the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:31.250
 name that we give to our pendrive 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.660
 I'm going to put the auto file system says 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.240
 I recommend that it is in this I remove already 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.970
 which is the one in the system file 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.160
 system files sorry the sun fat32 in 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.500
 fat 16 and 32 missing but if we want that 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.620
 that our pendrive does not have 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.510
 some size space limit for 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.270
 our operating system 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.970
 let's leave it by car 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.010
 and we're going to leave this without touching it and 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.990
 let's go to next good here they are 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.010
 all options 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.520
 as the summary of what we just 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.710
 choose 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.970
 well let's give it in land way is very 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.710
 important that before doing this 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.810
 let's take all the necessary information 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.390
 from our website we see the most 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.220
 important since when you do this 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.500
 process 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.520
 this form program will make you and will eliminate 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.290
 all the files that have to 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.750
 we had had in the usb to format 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.860
 the new operating system the beginning 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.780
 well this takes a little 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.699
 so I'm going to pause the video moment 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.689
 good once you finish formatting 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.370
 our usb copy the files from 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.110
 operating system download will tell us 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.039
 that we restart our our team 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.389
 to test our usb and it will be ready 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.729
 well this has been all for the moment 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.830
 I hope you liked it but I chose the 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.659
 guide of the video if it serves you but it 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.009
 subscribe to my channel and I hope they continue 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.539
