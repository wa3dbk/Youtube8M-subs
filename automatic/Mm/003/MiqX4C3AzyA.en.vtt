00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.480
 learn from mistakes 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.660
 Because they exist 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 a thousand ways to suspend 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.140
 a man comes and sits down to eat and his 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.980
 woman tells me I'll serve you and he answers 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.980
 sometimes 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.340
 which is better a pile or a woman 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.370
 a stack because the bng has a side 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.370
 positive 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.790
 well, Gregorio is our protagonist 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.180
 today and she is about to meet you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.660
 together with his friend the ball 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.290
 the pretty one we're going to go a little bit the pedal 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.290
 brake 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.640
 It can 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.040
 pay attention to him because he has arrived 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.020
 the moment to prove to this one 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.020
 examiner how well you drive 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.420
 this character has suspended for not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 respect the priority in the step of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.370
 pedestrians whenever we go 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.400
 driving and go near one step 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.750
 of pedestrians we slow down our speed 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.310
 we make our peripheral vision to both 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.870
 sides and if we see that by the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 directionality that the pedestrian follows 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.830
 he has every intention of approaching and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.870
 It is in the vicinity of it 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.930
 we must stop 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:51.479
 gently on time and for the next 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.670
 remember that the brake pedal is the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:59.159
 from the middle of the center 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.159
 but the means that are the brakes 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.579
 way to suspend number 5 happened to me the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.500
 step do not miss the next chapter 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.140
 in a thousand ways to suspend because the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.830
 thing I going to get very black my friend
