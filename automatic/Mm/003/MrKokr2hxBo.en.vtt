00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.230 
has too much been made of what happened
at<00:01:23.810> Bristol<00:01:24.140> last<00:01:24.170> week<00:01:24.790> normally<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.940> in<00:01:26.090> this

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
at Bristol last week normally is in this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.810 
at Bristol last week normally is in this
sport<00:01:26.510> I<00:01:26.690> guess<00:01:27.320> if<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:27.530> if<00:01:28.190> drivers<00:01:28.550> will

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
sport I guess if we if drivers will

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.190 
sport I guess if we if drivers will
start<00:01:29.150> beating<00:01:29.450> their<00:01:29.540> wives<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.960> start

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
start beating their wives and start

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.750 
start beating their wives and start
drinking<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.650> driving<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:31.160> would<00:01:31.610> make

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
drinking and driving it would make

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.960 
drinking and driving it would make
issues<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.420> lot<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:33.110> lot<00:01:33.530> less

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
issues like that lot a lot less

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.820 
issues like that lot a lot less
sensitive<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.030> people<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:35.990> think<00:01:36.470> that's

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
sensitive to people but I think that's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.520 
sensitive to people but I think that's
just<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.220> testimony<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.300> how<00:01:38.450> how<00:01:39.200> good<00:01:39.410> this

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
just a testimony to how how good this

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.560 
just a testimony to how how good this
sport<00:01:39.860> really<00:01:39.979> is<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.520> then<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.270> know<00:01:41.360> when

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
sport really is and then you know when

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.180 
sport really is and then you know when
when<00:01:41.900> something<00:01:42.229> that's<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.470> small<00:01:42.890> as<00:01:43.040> that

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
when something that's that small as that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.010 
when something that's that small as that
was<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.970> know<00:01:44.060> didn't<00:01:44.300> cost<00:01:44.420> anybody<00:01:44.840> any

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
was you know didn't cost anybody any

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.749 
was you know didn't cost anybody any
points<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.560> didn't<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:46.340> know<00:01:46.369> I<00:01:46.460> didn't<00:01:46.640> put

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
points it didn't you know I didn't put

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:47.859 
points it didn't you know I didn't put
him<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.030> wall<00:01:47.210> all<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.450> did<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.690> turn<00:01:47.810> around

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
him in the wall all I did is turn around

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.109 
him in the wall all I did is turn around
on<00:01:48.229> pit<00:01:48.410> lane<00:01:48.440> so<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:49.250> think<00:01:49.790> it's<00:01:49.940> definitely

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119
