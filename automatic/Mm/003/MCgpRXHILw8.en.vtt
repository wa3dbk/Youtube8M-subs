chocolate crema we're going to place it
on<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.799> jelly<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.789> we<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.090> some<00:02:07.369> raspberry

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
on a jelly then we have some raspberry

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.840 
on a jelly then we have some raspberry
and<00:02:08.780> crema<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.229> aspheres<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.640> raspberry

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and crema here aspheres little raspberry

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.570 
and crema here aspheres little raspberry
gel<00:02:12.299> freeze-dried<00:02:12.959> raspberry<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.739> little

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
gel freeze-dried raspberry a little

gel freeze-dried raspberry a little
chocolate<00:02:15.000> tube<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.569> then<00:02:15.660> we're<00:02:15.750> going<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
chocolate tube and then we're going to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.900 
chocolate tube and then we're going to
fill<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.470> raspberry<00:02:16.739> cream<00:02:17.220> and

decorate with some candied lemon

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.080 
decorate with some candied lemon
normally<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.459> know<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.580> think<00:02:20.819> about<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
normally I you know I think about the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.490 
normally I you know I think about the
flavors<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.569> we're<00:02:21.720> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.900> use<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.380> then

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
flavors that we're going to use and then

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.370 
flavors that we're going to use and then
try<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:22.769> draw<00:02:23.430> up<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.730> picture<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.690> my<00:02:24.810> mind<00:02:25.110> and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
try and draw up a picture in my mind and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.259 
try and draw up a picture in my mind and
on<00:02:25.650> paper<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.130> normally<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.790> know<00:02:26.880> make<00:02:27.060> some

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
on paper I normally you know make some

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.150 
on paper I normally you know make some
sketches<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.900> drawings<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.799> put<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.070> on

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
sketches and drawings if you put it on

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.460 
sketches and drawings if you put it on
paper<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:30.120> know<00:02:30.209> gives<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> good<00:02:31.079> idea<00:02:31.109> of

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
paper you know gives you a good idea of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.590 
paper you know gives you a good idea of
what<00:02:31.680> you're<00:02:31.829> going<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.359> don't

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
what you're going to do if you don't

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.030 
what you're going to do if you don't
then<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> might<00:02:34.079> forget<00:02:34.380> something<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:34.950> when

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
then you might forget something and when

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.009 
then you might forget something and when
you<00:02:35.070> actually<00:02:35.310> come<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.820> make<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.150> dish<00:02:36.390> you

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
you actually come to make that dish you

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.080 
you actually come to make that dish you
know<00:02:37.140> your<00:02:37.500> your<00:02:37.829> idea<00:02:38.190> completely<00:02:38.400> changes

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
know your your idea completely changes

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.060 
know your your idea completely changes
so<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.630> think<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.410> good<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.560> write<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:40.950> down

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
so I think it's good to write it down

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.340 
so I think it's good to write it down
and<00:02:41.310> draw<00:02:41.700> some<00:02:41.880> pictures<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.450> move<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.320> from

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
and draw some pictures and move on from

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.890 
and draw some pictures and move on from
there<00:02:43.530> until<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.130> perfected<00:02:44.640> yeah<00:02:44.880> we<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
there until you perfected yeah we have a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.940 
there until you perfected yeah we have a
raspberry<00:02:47.000> jelly<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.450> made<00:02:48.660> with

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
raspberry jelly this is made with

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.740 
raspberry jelly this is made with
vegetable<00:02:49.950> gelatine<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.329> chocolate<00:02:51.480> I've
