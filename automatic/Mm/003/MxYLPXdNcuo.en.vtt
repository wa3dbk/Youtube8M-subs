00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.290
 There are 300 kilometers from the mining capital 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.149
 Antofagasta is jumping 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.970
 small province that houses around 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.710
 of 13 thousand 500 inhabitants among them to 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.330
 the miners of the ashes who are 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.790
 are on strike for more than 20 days 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.800
 demanding their rights by taking their two 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.999
 mines and two production plants and 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.949
 asking for a production bonus 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.900
 health benefits for their families 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.269
 as well as the term bonus 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.949
 conflict in a camp erected between 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.689
 solidarity and fraternity of 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.759
 workers the company does not want 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 grant the demands and only respond 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.920
 with dismissals in taltal and in council 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.890
 one and seeing the same 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.890
 a life 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.649
 the wind does not say anything 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.240
 when your branch blooms 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.210
 a secretary of the ash syndicate 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.810
 plant option or protest 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.680
 good in these minutes we have 22 days 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:16.120
 of indefinite legal strike 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 It has been difficult to be with the company 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.630
 and the main cult which we 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.220
 we continue in this in this position is the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.050
 bn what is the term bonus of 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.670
 negotiation which which is in 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.850
 these minutes conditioned to what is 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.810
 the pressure frees us from the power of our 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.159
 international 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.170
 we believe that 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.409
 that as has been the case in other of our 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.609
 unions is not fair that we 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.310
 let us carry that burden on our 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:52.459
 shoulders in the sense that we are 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.020
 conditions therefore those values ​​that 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.189
 we consider that they should be 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.409
 eliminated 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.830
 we are 78 workers of which 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:09.600
 we are fighting for 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:14.170
 end a background conflict with this 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:19.140
 that we have 44 tasks taken 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.800
 we have look at the light plant at twelve 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.420
 implanted oxide altamira we have 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.900
 that maintain the posture mainly and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.740
 that is not associated keep firm on 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.010
 that sense that we want the 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.010
 community know in what situation 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.010
 we're 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.900
 we are asking as something might think 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:54.120
 the community are not just things 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:58.950
 common and that really is the service 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.980
 the effort of all workers in 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.980
 these isolated areas of his family 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:12.030
 with sadness honduras suddenly but 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:15.090
 here trying to keep it faithful to 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.709
 our healthy is sensitized with the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.950
 cut we have not had any kind of 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.230
 approach in reality 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.590
 we are very relatively a union two 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.410
 new understand that we do not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.300
 we are associated with no figure 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:35.630
 central but firm and we hope that 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.190
 those great organizations have joined 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.459
 they can support us we need to also 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.560
 their wingspan their structure are large 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.400
 organizations and maybe they could give us 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.440
 a little hand of those who have most 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.730
 supported this important struggle have been 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.290
 the students of the faculty of 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.810
 humanities of the ucn antofagasta 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.310
 organizing strike funds activities 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.170
 the necessary unification between 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.610
 students and workers for 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.610
 Conquer our rights 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.420
 the truth that here with my 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.530
 companions with more than twenty-odd days 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.709
 to strike 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.930
 I want to take people to the cut-to all 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.380
 and government representatives who 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.560
 listen and make a measure that this one 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.210
 Express personal but complete where 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.190
 is showing only by one point 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.060
 which is a local conflict May bonus 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.979
 they do not want to force you to sign in 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.069
 there goes quad over the last subject 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.590
 three quotas to the price of copper no value 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.660
 we do not consider that that can not be and 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.680
 has not been seen seeks the low in Chile 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.139
 therefore sunk someone recommend 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.490
 that comes close to seeing reality the 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.680
 reality curve that we are living in 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.349
 the other cases because of the distance from the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.289
