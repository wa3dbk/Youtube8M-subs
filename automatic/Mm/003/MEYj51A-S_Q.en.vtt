00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
to temple this this whole section should

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.460 
to temple this this whole section should
probably<00:02:16.940> make<00:02:17.120> about<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:19.450> two<00:02:20.450> three<00:02:22.420> four

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
probably make about one two three four

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.430 
probably make about one two three four
five<00:02:24.670> sections<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.849> total<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.110> we'll<00:02:27.230> start

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
five sections in total so we'll start

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.720

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.930

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.050 
you
I<00:03:13.560> think<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.650> depends<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.160> your<00:03:15.310> hair<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:15.910> I'm

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
I think it depends on your hair but I'm

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.660 
I think it depends on your hair but I'm
probably<00:03:16.780> holding<00:03:17.470> these<00:03:17.650> for<00:03:17.890> about<00:03:17.950> 30

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
probably holding these for about 30

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.560 
probably holding these for about 30
seconds<00:03:20.460> some<00:03:21.460> of<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.610> bigger<00:03:21.850> sections<00:03:22.300> may

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
seconds some of the bigger sections may

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.290 
seconds some of the bigger sections may
be<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.230> little<00:03:23.410> bit<00:03:23.590> longer<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.180> look

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
be a little bit longer but if you look

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.390 
be a little bit longer but if you look
quite<00:03:25.510> fine<00:03:25.840> hair<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.440> might<00:03:26.680> only<00:03:27.070> need<00:03:27.190> to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
quite fine hair you might only need to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.900 
quite fine hair you might only need to
hold<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:28.330> for<00:03:28.390> like<00:03:28.780> 15<00:03:29.230> seconds

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.110 

okay<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:33.970> now<00:03:34.390> we're<00:03:34.540> going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.990> top

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.970 

she<00:03:40.750> fun<00:03:42.150> okay<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.569> when<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.080> reduces

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
through it from there it's almost a very

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.210 
through it from there it's almost a very
loose<00:03:55.959> wave<00:03:56.319> just<00:03:56.709> call<00:03:57.400> mr.<00:03:57.670> bend<00:03:59.129> so<00:04:00.129> I'm

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220
