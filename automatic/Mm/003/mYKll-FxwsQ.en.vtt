00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Welcome back to biopower 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.279
 Panda I was just at the dm 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.930
 Shopping because I have a few things 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.940
 used for such an autumn make-up 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.170
 tutorial and prosperity with my type 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.330
 I have gone out yet 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.590
 thought tail makes it up in the sky 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 These are the things I bought 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.480
 we have to go where as 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.640
 First I looked up from these, the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.010
 precision make-up bought so 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
 Say the fei duty blender I have until 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.830
 never tried it like this before and 1 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.930
 today I thought so 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.609
 you take time with one bap and new of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.810
 davy merchant after the end you can 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.940
 Definitely great with the then together 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 I'm using l'oréal paris 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.140
 once the perfect match foundation 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.930
 brought and the matching brother me 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 I've been in her video until 27 recently 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.170
 seen and I thought necessarily 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.390
 I'll try it in now 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 The color was taken out of miller it is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 he two tcs is the bright color the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.539
 says s now I had but believe 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.699
 that often in germany not the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.620
 the very highest colors sell something real 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.149
 a little stupid is extremely light skin color 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 and then you usually see it 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 not 100 percent fits but allegedly 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 is it a foundation that is the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 structure and the color of my skin 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.060
 wanted to adjust and the powder to do so 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.470
 because I have to go 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.600
 one needed but I have it then 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.750
 just tested in the store and it has me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.070
 I also have really velvety texture 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.080
 this eyeshadow from l' oreal 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 palette brought that in a total of four 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.229
 different colors in it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
 they all have a very strong one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
 Covering power than dedicating it to the city 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 animals and I thought colors are suitable 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 excellent in the fall then I was up 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.090
 looking for so nervous lipstick color 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 the very intense blue one is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.390
 voted for in the end for a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.930
 lipstick also decided by l'oreal 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.670
 until the color 374 and that is called in 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.560
 So it remains exactly what I was looking for 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.150
 have a look how the next acts 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.860
 on the lips as I hope the color 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.270
 is not so points for me and then 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.610
 I have my absolute favorite 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.370
 Concealer is never fit 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.050
 a medellín or is the number 15 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.450
 That's the half color the idea has 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.110
 and I think the track is really great 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 beautiful 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.280
 He has a very nice texture 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.260
 not too heavy and also gets relative 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.420
 I have a lot to do with body care 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.610
 my favorite rinse brought it 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.890
 the listerine totalcare if you are 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.060
 already thinks litter video looks at that 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.130
 I linked you here 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.690
 speak of exactly this wish 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.090
 Cooling there I have a few more 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.800
 brought deco products because I'm up 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.660
 one well flowed from time to time as a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.920
 few small enforced projects are not 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 but many, but I have einstein 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.940
 planned in the fall and I have a few 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.400
 things to buy once so small 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.770
 sternanis you only have one euro 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.940
 exactly 1 euro 15 have only cost 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.650
 then a glittering ribbon on 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.510
 cat hair on it a glittering 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.120
 It is long and four meters long 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.260
 was also cheap a euro 25 just that 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.660
 I always want a change 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.670
 projects and then so otto 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.110
 sprechers there was in the golden silver me 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.700
 but wanted to have the gold 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.950
 because it is then to this project 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.510
 it cost me a euro 95 cost me 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.459
 think the price is okay and then have 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.350
 I remember alnatura once 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.299
 ground vanilli brought so 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.010
 vanilla pods because they are great 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.350
 I used it for baking 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.000
 keep fresh bag is made at 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.500
 dm always great things from 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.940
 So of course, household everything 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.680
 cleaning products and so on and I have 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.260
 simply a faible for cleaning agents and 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.390
 so I sometimes like to vote tmn 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.680
 dishwashers tabs we went out 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.450
 have which use wide 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 Dishwasher tabs, I noticed that 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.290
 it does not matter if mainz the more expensive the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.579
 cheap purchase and I am generally with 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.840
 He makes the thinking of products 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.130
 is satisfied in just have the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.769
 that was the cheapest for them 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.600
 These had to be in 660 pieces and 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.940
 as last an absolute highlight of the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.130
 Rummaging found that it was this 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.000
 candle here from eric that's the home 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.950

 There were cafes and 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
