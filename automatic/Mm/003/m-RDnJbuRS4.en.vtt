00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.030
 of doing good now came out that then 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.750
 we have with the 2 and the 16 right 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.140
 upwards and towards the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.090
 right vale 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.110
 this one that is the same but up and 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.110
 right goes top left 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.810
 jose then Neymar when the Brazilian 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.450
 and well these two are my dribbles 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.450
 favorites this is the right chic 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.820
 up and right is always worth 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.730
 keeping l 2 l2 up 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.890
 left is worth or up and right 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.890
 I remind you this one is low and right 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.520
 and this up left 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.170
 up right and you know 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.340
 now I'm going to show you the kilos of r1 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.610
 they took out the reflection to 12 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 and are very important are made about 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.990
 everything from the band 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.440
 and you can mark golazos look here 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.440
 from here 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.569
 Neymar had failed 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.129
 and well you know 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.830
 with the left leg to see how it is 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.990
 he gives 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.870
 and then if you are in the frontal os 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.940
 l2 and powerful recommend a stick worth 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.330
 like that side the stringer and the rebound 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.330
 goal 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.650
 good to see here from further away l 2 and 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.710
 strong I recommend today almost 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.230
 last shot 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.440
 a great goal, I'll show you rabonas 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.620
 neymar know my partner rodrigo neymar 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.940
 knows rabonas or not and I think so 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.019
 surely but we go to university and 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.120
 is the goalie hart incessantly now yes I 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.490
 it looks like it's joe hart from manchester 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.710
 city 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.740
 so you can create new trap and 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.220
 so to see if rabona frame 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.760
 and rabona are used mostly for 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.510
 center 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.430
 but you can also score goals by using them 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.430
 ok to see if I get out there will be stopped 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.790
 are with l 2 and with the right stick 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.670
 pointing to the side where 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.400
 you want to shoot, but it has to be 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.960
 with one leg in the one I mean yes 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.090
 you are running to the right towards 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.380
 the left is worth then it goes is 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.340
 to the left with the joystick 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.430
 right to the left is worth it 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.800
 to the left is worth 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.910
 and if you are running 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:10.660
 to the left as it goes there 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.290
 and so it seems to me that you could 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.390
 also with the left destination do it 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.690
 yes it's worth left you can also do it 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:23.220
 sometimes left-handed or right-handed 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.500
 it depends on the body it is worth remembering l2 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.150
 square and with them and left not what 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.800
 I say it's okay if you go the run to the 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.140
 right to the left and if it does not 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.640
 the right is worth last rabble to see if the 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.610
 method is hardly that of the work not 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.760
 it is but there are people who are not great uy 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.250
 good for centers are very nice 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.850
 good good come I'm going to show you some 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.850
 quick penalties like this 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.310
 you see the bar here below metric 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.230
 the green and give it more or less a 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.110
 half power bar or the penalty 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.970
 and with the left yesi, point towards 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.100
 the squadron or where do you think I'm going 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.490
 throw to school squad right to 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.490
 see how 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.910
 the work 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.910
 but determine it more now seriously 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.729
 this to the left square goes air 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.990
 I remind you that Neymar has little 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.060
 power and such 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.490
 the other kids 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.230
 well now my partner Rodrigo goes to 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.230
 throw one caught the camera 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.860
 Rodrigo one of the kids 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.830
 the busted goal striker 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.590
 look at the repetition that the goal and here 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.480
 a penalty 11 faster than the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.720
 video lasts long yes no 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.900

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.600
 burst striker goal good I hope that
