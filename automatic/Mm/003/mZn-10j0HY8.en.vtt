don't see on the street cuz I don't live
in<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> state<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.780> I'm<00:00:09.780> partly<00:00:10.110> making<00:00:10.469> this

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
in the state so I'm partly making this

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.539 
in the state so I'm partly making this
up<00:00:10.800> actually<00:00:12.380> not<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.429> that

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
up actually not really think of that

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.609 
up actually not really think of that
that's<00:00:14.730> its<00:00:15.000> kind<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.240> footprint<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
that's its kind of footprint on on the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.269 
that's its kind of footprint on on the
floor<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> you're<00:00:19.830> gonna<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:22.100> bring<00:00:23.100> this

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
floor so you're gonna want to bring this

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.020 
floor so you're gonna want to bring this
around<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:31.009> to<00:00:32.009> kind<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.369> echo<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
around and then to kind of echo on the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.090 
around and then to kind of echo on the
inside<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.010> we've

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
inside there like that and then we've

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.700 
inside there like that and then we've
got<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.430> feet<00:00:35.460> bolted<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> floor<00:00:37.670> and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
got little feet bolted to the floor and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.389 
got little feet bolted to the floor and
it's<00:00:40.710> gonna<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> bottom<00:00:41.489> about<00:00:41.730> there

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
it's gonna be the bottom about there

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
it's gonna be the bottom about there
like<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.149> we've<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.809> u.s.<00:00:46.200> mail

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
like that and then we've got a u.s. mail

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:58.189 
like that and then we've got a u.s. mail
on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> side<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:53.510> opening<00:00:54.620> like<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:57.199> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
on the side and opening like that and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
on the side and opening like that and
now<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:59.010> slightly<00:00:59.280> making<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> up

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
now it's around slightly making it up

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.160 
now it's around slightly making it up
cuz<00:00:59.969> I'm<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.149> entirely<00:01:00.449> sure<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.960> works

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
cuz I'm not entirely sure how it works

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.620 
cuz I'm not entirely sure how it works
inside<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:02.870> think<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> handle<00:01:04.739> there

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
inside I think you have a handle there

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
inside I think you have a handle there
and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:08.780> opening<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.260> mailman<00:01:11.010> comes

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and then opening bit with mailman comes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.960 
and then opening bit with mailman comes
and<00:01:11.520> gets<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:13.340> say<00:01:14.340> yes<00:01:16.009> ma'am<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and gets it down say yes ma'am this is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.590 
and gets it down say yes ma'am this is
basically<00:01:18.420> there<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.880> should<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.299> all<00:01:21.450> this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
basically there so I should do all this

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.160 
basically there so I should do all this
bit<00:01:21.840> around<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.200> first<00:01:23.060> come<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
bit around here first come down to the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.120 
bit around here first come down to the
bottom<00:01:27.020> come<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.560> bottom<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
bottom come down to the bottom of the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.270 
bottom come down to the bottom of the
leg<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> draw<00:01:33.829> around<00:01:34.829> this

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.969 

circle<00:01:38.570> oops

there's<00:02:10.709> no<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.670> something<00:02:11.880> you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
there's no that it's just something you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
there's no that it's just something you
see<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> street<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.170> draw<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.620> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
see on the street that you draw up and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.090 
see on the street that you draw up and
logos<00:02:14.310> get<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> bit<00:02:14.910> tricky<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:18.890> little<00:02:19.890> bit<00:02:19.980> of

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
logos get a bit tricky a little bit of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.009 
logos get a bit tricky a little bit of
shading<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:21.060> because<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.810> that

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
shading in there because I think that

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.990 
shading in there because I think that
goes<00:02:22.410> deeper<00:02:22.980> than<00:02:23.160> that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.890 

it's<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.120> kind<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:29.450> its<00:02:30.450> recessed<00:02:30.989> for<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:32.900> rain

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it's a kind of its recessed for the rain

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.470 
it's a kind of its recessed for the rain
drips<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.560> think<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.610> doesn't<00:02:35.940> gonna<00:02:36.090> get<00:02:36.299> in

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
drips I think so it doesn't gonna get in

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:56.470 
drips I think so it doesn't gonna get in
