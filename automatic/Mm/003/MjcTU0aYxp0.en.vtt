00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
all as you can see my first attempt well

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.129 
all as you can see my first attempt well
actually<00:03:42.389> like<00:03:42.690> my<00:03:42.810> second<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.379> started<00:03:45.139> using

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
actually like my second I started using

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.020 
actually like my second I started using
my<00:03:46.319> foot<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.859> get<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.190> off<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.639> kind<00:03:47.909> of

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
my foot to get it off but I kind of

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.569 
my foot to get it off but I kind of
scratched<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.659> right<00:03:48.810> there<00:03:49.109> not<00:03:49.949> too<00:03:50.129> bad

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
scratched it right there not too bad

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.300 
scratched it right there not too bad
still<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.180> mean<00:03:51.629> it's<00:03:51.780> still<00:03:51.959> usable<00:03:52.349> very

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
still I mean it's still usable very

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.110 
still I mean it's still usable very
usable<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:55.440> then<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.430> get<00:03:56.579> this<00:03:56.790> you

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
usable and then you just get this you

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.899 
usable and then you just get this you
put<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.079> on<00:03:58.199> there<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:59.569> you're<00:04:00.569> gonna<00:04:00.659> eat<00:04:00.750> you

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
put it on there and you're gonna eat you

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:11.530 
put it on there and you're gonna eat you
like<00:04:02.909> I<00:04:03.090> did<00:04:03.150> my<00:04:03.840> third<00:04:04.109> try<00:04:04.470> doing<00:04:05.250> this

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.210 

just<00:04:12.409> like<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.769> my<00:04:13.549> third<00:04:13.819> try<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.450> had<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:15.220> my

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
just like that my third try I had a my

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.390 
just like that my third try I had a my
foot<00:04:16.489> here<00:04:17.290> on<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.560> thing<00:04:18.769> pushing<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.250> bike

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
foot here on this thing pushing the bike

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.379 
foot here on this thing pushing the bike
forward<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:22.040> then<00:04:22.460> pulling<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:23.090> thing

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
forward and and then pulling this thing

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.120 
forward and and then pulling this thing
with<00:04:23.810> two<00:04:24.080> hands<00:04:24.380> at<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.710> same<00:04:24.860> time

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
with two hands at the same time

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.060 
with two hands at the same time
obviously<00:04:25.880> my<00:04:26.389> hand<00:04:26.630> was<00:04:26.780> up<00:04:26.810> up<00:04:27.350> in<00:04:27.590> here<00:04:27.889> on

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
obviously my hand was up up in here on

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.279 
obviously my hand was up up in here on
my<00:04:28.280> other<00:04:28.400> hand<00:04:28.520> pulling<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.330> as<00:04:29.810> hard<00:04:30.050> as<00:04:30.169> I

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
my other hand pulling it as hard as I

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.850 
my other hand pulling it as hard as I
possibly<00:04:30.320> could<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.550> eventually<00:04:32.270> at<00:04:32.419> broke

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
possibly could and eventually at broke

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.460 
possibly could and eventually at broke
it<00:04:33.860> finally<00:04:34.280> gave<00:04:34.460> free<00:04:34.789> I<00:04:36.169> up<00:04:36.260> my<00:04:36.410> knee

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
it finally gave free I up my knee

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.529 
it finally gave free I up my knee
a<00:04:36.590> little<00:04:36.830> in<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.340> beginning<00:04:37.760> when<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.360> was

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
a little in the beginning when I was

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.360 
a little in the beginning when I was
trying<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.870> stomp<00:04:39.110> on<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.350> but<00:04:41.500> yeah<00:04:42.500> if<00:04:43.250> you're

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
trying to stomp on it but yeah if you're

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.620 
trying to stomp on it but yeah if you're
pretty<00:04:43.520> damn<00:04:43.699> strong<00:04:43.940> you<00:04:44.180> probably<00:04:44.419> might

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
pretty damn strong you probably might

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.980 
pretty damn strong you probably might
not<00:04:44.780> have<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.850> problem<00:04:46.850> taking<00:04:47.449> this<00:04:47.539> off<00:04:47.750> but

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
not have a problem taking this off but

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
not have a problem taking this off but
you<00:04:48.139> just<00:04:48.380> eventually<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:50.210> unscrew<00:04:50.720> this

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
you just eventually just unscrew this

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.930 
you just eventually just unscrew this
comes<00:04:52.010> off<00:04:52.630> it's<00:04:53.630> gonna<00:04:53.750> be<00:04:53.930> here<00:04:54.289> and<00:04:54.940> then

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
comes off it's gonna be here and then

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.939 
comes off it's gonna be here and then
your<00:04:56.389> wheel<00:04:56.570> just<00:04:56.810> comes<00:04:56.990> right<00:04:57.350> off<00:04:57.380> just

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
your wheel just comes right off just

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.529 
your wheel just comes right off just
like<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.930> it's<00:05:00.289> gonna<00:05:00.410> look<00:05:00.590> like<00:05:00.650> this

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539

like that and it's gonna look like this
I'm<00:05:02.539> putting<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.900> back<00:05:03.080> in<00:05:03.260> there<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:03.500> I

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
I'm putting that back in there so I

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.100

gonna<00:05:24.650> sit<00:05:24.949> like<00:05:25.099> that<00:05:25.250> but<00:05:25.400> it's<00:05:25.490> gonna<00:05:25.610> be

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
gonna sit like that but it's gonna be

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.469 
gonna sit like that but it's gonna be
more<00:05:26.000> on<00:05:26.030> you<00:05:26.750> know<00:05:26.780> it's<00:05:27.050> gonna<00:05:27.139> be<00:05:27.289> on<00:05:27.470> there

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
more on you know it's gonna be on there

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.600 
more on you know it's gonna be on there
and<00:05:29.479> I'll<00:05:30.169> see<00:05:30.620> if<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.830> can<00:05:30.979> show<00:05:31.190> you<00:05:31.250> what<00:05:31.490> it

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
and I'll see if I can show you what it

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.830 
and I'll see if I can show you what it
does<00:05:31.639> when<00:05:32.150> you<00:05:32.780> click<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.139> brake<00:05:36.310> so<00:05:37.840> this

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
does when you click the brake so this

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.310 
does when you click the brake so this
little<00:05:39.139> piece<00:05:39.380> right<00:05:40.060> there<00:05:41.110> when<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.199> hit

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
little piece right there when you hit

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.510 
little piece right there when you hit
the<00:05:42.470> back<00:05:42.620> brake<00:05:42.919> it<00:05:43.430> turns<00:05:44.860> that's<00:05:45.860> about<00:05:46.130> it

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
the back brake it turns that's about it

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.120 
the back brake it turns that's about it
should<00:05:46.669> be<00:05:46.820> turning<00:05:47.150> more<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:47.680> think<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:51.130> and

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
should be turning more I think and and

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.310 
should be turning more I think and and
what<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.430> does<00:05:52.580> is<00:05:52.789> it<00:05:52.970> just<00:05:53.180> separates<00:05:53.930> this

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
what it does is it just separates this

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.879 
what it does is it just separates this
and<00:05:54.919> then<00:05:56.050> grabs<00:05:57.050> on<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.260> your<00:05:57.470> wheel<00:05:57.650> up<00:05:57.860> here

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
and then grabs on to your wheel up here

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.960 
and then grabs on to your wheel up here
to<00:05:58.340> slow<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:58.729> down<00:05:59.979> I'm<00:06:00.979> not<00:06:01.190> exactly<00:06:01.520> sure<00:06:01.729> if

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
to slow it down I'm not exactly sure if

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.080 
to slow it down I'm not exactly sure if
I<00:06:02.270> need<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:02.599> replace<00:06:02.990> this<00:06:03.699> I'm<00:06:04.699> gonna<00:06:04.909> look
