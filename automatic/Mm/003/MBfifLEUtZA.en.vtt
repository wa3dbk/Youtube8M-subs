00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.440
 and then staff okay scored again 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.490
 here with you today for another milestone 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.260
 does not reply 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.090
 answering the question of my friend is 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.150
 my line that asked the following 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.820
 marketing talks a little about height 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.279
 of schools, how can this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.130
 influence in totality 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.520
 so I can not speak the following is 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.470
 You have there is the height of the strings she 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.970
 will really influence the whole 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.850
 the guitarist is 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.489
 there are people who wear it a little higher 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.140
 highest scores are usually rita 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.000
 and says that it has a stronger footprint is 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.070
 that footprint on the cruise that kind of 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.920
 thing and the guitarists who use the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.690
 footprint more than the lower judgments is 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.329
 Well, in action, you must get the catch. 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.250
 A quick understanding of your car in the 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.920
 debut in this type of thing but neither 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.030
 this is always a rule. 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.890
 your exceptions 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.440
 What I can say the following in part 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.600
 adjustment on the guitar 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.009
 the tokachi bridges it for example 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.229
 You find you have the following 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.270
 you have two screws are the voice and 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.820
 that will rise and the height of the bridge 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.939
 both a source of laws against a 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.040
 bridge flávio 11 is rosé champagne 2 os 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.090
 two pivots that you are going to raise then 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.610
 you have the arm 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.439
 the pilots is that you will regulate it 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.320
 always Angolan more or less one 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.540
 way you keep the two states 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.509
 at the same time to point this out 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.719
 and change here to the height of the blocks 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.219
 also something that is different there is the 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.729
 case when I told you about the road bridge 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.759
 tokachi and where each cart 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.860
 each ballot or has or a regulation of 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.950
 different height, because the bridge is 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.289
 so you have it there for every 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.939
 rope you have a cart and you have 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.520
 different height on the bolts 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.579
 now part of height as you go 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.259
 To regulate this is there are some things there to 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.180
 and I 'm not going to get into the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.070
 matter because this is a matter of luti 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.810
 and I'd rather not get in too much because 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.060
 I really do not quite understand this. 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.099
 there is part of the tensioning 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.660
 kind of thing but let's suppose that you 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.870
 go epa 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.540
 you will assume that your 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.460
 Arm is actually straight adjusted is 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.920
 You picked up the guitar and looked at the dodo. 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.870
 on the bottom part here again you have 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.940
 the strings attached here you have the arm 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.220
 For there you look so you give a 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.970
 look and you actually see the arm 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.710
 it's straight 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.470
 then you will see more or less 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.560
 What height can I tell you to do? 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.880
 you download the one from the house if you like 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.230
 a low action you lower the pivots of the 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.520
 bridge until you listen to avoid 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.440
 tragedy the trash 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.660
 You start to lift a little until 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.400
 that does not bring any more, you make one 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.420
 amplifier connected because when you 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.740
 It's off 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.870
 the tendency is for you to continue 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.080
 Stress noise then you can find 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.540
 that this is a tragedy that is not another 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.550
 natural guitar alloy tool 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.860
 now you have to do when you stay 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.920
 I'll call you, you can listen and another. 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.080
 thing is also cool you see there more or 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.970
 less a height that is cool to leave more 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.380
 or less one millimeter and mail how 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.209
 Do you think that's where you can learn? 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.630
 tighten on the sixth string you 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.700
 First brings my first home, right? 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.480
 You will then you will do this. 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.440
 measurement is on the fret of your guitar 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.470
 Today you have the arm junction where you have it. 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.230
 the arm body function with the kl in the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.530
 frete and 19 let's suppose you 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.200
 lay there presses right and places to see 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.500
 measure he puts a ruler a playground 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.120
 for a thing as soon as you can 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.000
 view and more or less this size 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.310
 of measurement and there you if you want 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.440
 avoid recess could hold you 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.300
 a very nice little business here 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.860
 you can even increase or if you 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.870
 really have a stronger footprint 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.660
 more blueseiro but there is something like this 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.620
 you can give a raise the pros and 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.370
 cons said the following is more 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.070
 shallow action is lower action - the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.580
 system has a slightly higher 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.810
 otherwise I can not play with 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.120
 guitar 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.410
 a busy one with the very high quotas I 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.810
 I prefer lower 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.250
 although I'm not the guitarist who 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.290
 I said at the beginning and this is more for 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.200
 Who flies in the arm and flip-flops? 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.030
 I'm not like this but I like the zone. 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.630
 visited the lower strings in 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.110
 guitar 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.500
 worth is what I say to you it is 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.360
 good to always test do the place it 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.000
 here it's the way you want it is not 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.110
 very cool to talk like this look do this 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.300
 because that is if this distance does not 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.669
 Whatever you think is best 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.830
 way you see fit and is 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.200
 next if you really have not 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.290
 have not been able to bring 1 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.800
 in the tie that really is the most suitable 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.030
 that there would be some changes in some 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.950
 What are you going to do? 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.729
 really need regulation that 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.220
 thought the leveling of the back face not 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.260
 try to do this at home leads with luti and 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.830
 who better man knows what she understands 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.540
 paid program there were you spending there 200 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.150
 It's in money, something like that. 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.100
 account the price I take to spend this 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.900
 that you do something that might 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.510
 damage your instrument and then 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.970
 have a much greater expense beauty dill 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.550
 I hope I have responded to you and so 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.440
 also to all who have this doubt 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.690
 and our guitarist friends there 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.160
 have this doubt I hope this video 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.050
 may have satisfied the curiosity of 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.039
 some who think in the same way and have 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.370
 this doubt 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:06.690
 thanks folks a hug so together 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.690
 good guitarists
