massive bulb it's got an Edison screw

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.960 
massive bulb it's got an Edison screw
fitting<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:22.039> that'll<00:00:23.039> fit<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.699> desk

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
fitting so that'll fit in a lot of desk

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.540 
fitting so that'll fit in a lot of desk
lamps<00:00:24.420> floor<00:00:25.230> lamps<00:00:25.619> I'll<00:00:25.859> demonstrate<00:00:26.160> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
lamps floor lamps I'll demonstrate you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
lamps floor lamps I'll demonstrate you
to<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> floor<00:00:27.240> lamp<00:00:27.359> soon<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to it in a floor lamp soon and the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.910 
to it in a floor lamp soon and the
speaker<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.929> 2.4<00:00:30.929> watt<00:00:31.230> single<00:00:31.529> driver

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
speaker is a 2.4 watt single driver

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.240 
speaker is a 2.4 watt single driver
speaker<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:33.480> has<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.690> frequency<00:00:34.140> response<00:00:34.710> of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
speaker it has a frequency response of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.350 
speaker it has a frequency response of
36<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> 17<00:00:36.450> kilohertz<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.670> sound<00:00:39.000> quality

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
36 to 17 kilohertz so the sound quality

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569 
36 to 17 kilohertz so the sound quality
from<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.530> par<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
from this is going to be on par with a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
from this is going to be on par with a
sort<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.200> lower<00:00:43.399> range<00:00:44.399> iPod<00:00:45.239> dock<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.590> 9

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
sort of lower range iPod dock it's a 9

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.160 
sort of lower range iPod dock it's a 9
watt<00:00:47.219> bulb<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.539> when<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> bulb

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
watt bulb and so when it's just a bulb

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
watt bulb and so when it's just a bulb
it's<00:00:49.350> only<00:00:49.530> 9<00:00:49.800> Watts<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.520> quite<00:00:50.850> low<00:00:51.030> for

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it's only 9 Watts which is quite low for

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.990 
it's only 9 Watts which is quite low for
energy<00:00:51.899> saving<00:00:52.460> for<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> energy-saving

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
energy saving for the energy-saving

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.840 
energy saving for the energy-saving
