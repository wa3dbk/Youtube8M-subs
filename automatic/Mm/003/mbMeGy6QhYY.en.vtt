00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.629
 hello and welcome to all of you 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.670
 astronaut samantha cristoforetti 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.650
 the European Space Agency which is 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.309
 was preparing to connect to the station 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.230
 Space 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 when suddenly an orange light 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.339
 began to shine and its light was 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.689
 reflected everywhere on the panels 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.210
 solar station 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.359
 and that impressed intimidate samantha 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.130
 you can hear her voice she saw 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.480
 something very powerful enlightened 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 and come to meet him 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.160
 a Briand UFO appeared near her 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.810
 astronauts are ready for anything and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.420
 are very strong not to fall into 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.060
 easy fright as you know 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 all UFO sightings at the 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.630
 space station is an event 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 weekly 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.650
 the only thing that could cause 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.810
 such an emotional reaction and who 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.280
 could test a real astronaut is 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.750
 a close encounter with a 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.790
 alien ship 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.790
 listen to the voice of samantha 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.430
 samantha cristoforetti says for 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.280
 the moment I will tell you another 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.890
 time because I was very lucky and that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.479
 happened without warning while I 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.190
 I was going back to look behind me 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.150
 I saw the solar panels of our 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.090
 rocket soyouz 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.920
 then I spotted something in my 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.869
 peripheral vision 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.509
 I turned very slowly and 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.700
 I understood what I had just seen 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.770
 I was enthralled by a nameless joy 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.290
 the space station was there but this 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.700
 was not just any scene the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.830
 huge solar panels of the resort 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 was flooded with an orange light 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.110
 flamboyant living warm almost 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.880
 Foreign 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.590
 I could not help expressing my 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.630
 stupor with a loud voice 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.430
 you can probably hear it in 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.410
 the details of the stowage because at this 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.320
 moment the mission control mic was 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.209
 listening in autumn reminded me this 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.280
 so I tried to contain my 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.600
 amazement and I went back in front 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 control screens 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.489
 when I took another look at the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.500
 light was gone I leave you in 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.040
 judge for yourself and I tell you to 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.040
 very soon
