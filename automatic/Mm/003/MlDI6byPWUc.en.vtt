00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 yes 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.179
 do not 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.830
 by the grace of God let's seek to be 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.940
 rekindled by prayer today we meditate 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.110
 about the security that God hears 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.840
 Our prayers 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.560
 God accepts and hears the prayers of the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.340
 who have a confident humble heart and 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.450
 contrite I saw that every elevated prayer with 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.440
 faith for a sincere heart will be heard and 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.300
 answered by God and that the supplicant 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.590
 you will get the blessing when more the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.680
 you need and often this will exceed your 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.650
 expectations do not miss a single 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.759
 prayer of a true saint if it is 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.210
 elevated with faith by a sincere heart the 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:13.300
 path of sincerity and integrity not 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.759
 it is a path free of obstruction but 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.310
 in all difficulty we have to see a 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.280
 invitation to pray no living being 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.520
 has power that has not received from God 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.670
 and the source from which it comes is 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.729
 open for the weaker human being 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.240
 when the sincere and humble prayers 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.659
 of sinners ascend to the throne of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.930
 god that this mixes with them the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.990
 merits of his own life of perfect 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:49.110
 obedience and then our prayers 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.670
 they are fragrant grace of incense 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.899
 Christ has promised to intercede 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.280
 in our favor and the father always hears 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.590
 to the son the answer of God not always 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.670
 They are what we expect but Mr. 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.860
 always responds sometimes or we give ourselves 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.100
 account 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.520
 these brief concepts are based on 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.690
 the magazine revived by the prayer of 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.390
 elena de juan read meditate in the chapter 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.670
 full we dedicate time to prayer 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 deprived of family prayer in the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.510
 small group in the church and in everything 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.210
 place so that we may be rejoiced in 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.470
 hope patients in suffering 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.890
 and persevering in prayer 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.690
 Now I invite you to talk to God 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.420

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.730

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.080

 prayer because we can be victorious and 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.969
 grow in our communion with Jesus 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.939

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:07.060
