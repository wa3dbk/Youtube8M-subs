00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.350 
my laptop we've got the radio and I'm
now<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.800> small<00:01:50.070> demonstration

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
now going to do a small demonstration

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.029 
now going to do a small demonstration
control<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> plane<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.410> small<00:01:52.649> aerial

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
control the plane do a small aerial

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.740 
control the plane do a small aerial
survey<00:01:53.429> and<00:01:53.610> control<00:01:53.940> everything<00:01:54.270> from<00:01:54.450> what

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
survey and control everything from what

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.290 
survey and control everything from what
you<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.220> just<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.310> few<00:01:56.340> basics<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.090> on

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
you see here just a few basics really on

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.690 
you see here just a few basics really on
operations<00:01:58.039> first<00:01:59.039> thing<00:01:59.190> we<00:01:59.250> need<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.429> check

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
operations first thing we need to check

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.160 
operations first thing we need to check
really<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.300> camera<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.660> working<00:02:00.810> we

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
really is that the camera is working we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.540 
really is that the camera is working we
can<00:02:01.289> simply<00:02:01.619> shake<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.950> plane<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.429> down

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
can simply shake the plane up and down

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.889 
can simply shake the plane up and down
three<00:02:02.789> times<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.240> turn<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.539> camera<00:02:03.840> on

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
three times to turn the camera on

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.810 
three times to turn the camera on
Florence<00:02:04.740> were<00:02:04.830> happy<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.190> that<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.670> can

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Florence were happy with that we can

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.190 
Florence were happy with that we can
shake<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.090> plane<00:02:06.270> three<00:02:06.479> times<00:02:06.720> forward

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
shake the plane three times forward

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
shake the plane three times forward
since<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> propeller<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.850> then<00:02:09.300> we're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
since the propeller on and then we're

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:22.290 
since the propeller on and then we're
ready<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.780> flight<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.200> take<00:02:10.380> off

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.670 

so<00:02:23.300> we<00:02:23.390> just<00:02:23.570> seen<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.750> swing<00:02:24.020> like<00:02:24.200> Cameron<00:02:24.530> its

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
so we just seen a swing like Cameron its

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.560 
so we just seen a swing like Cameron its
first<00:02:24.890> flight<00:02:25.040> over<00:02:25.430> Costain<00:02:25.880> Junction

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
first flight over Costain Junction

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.420 
first flight over Costain Junction
improvement<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.260> within<00:02:27.830> half<00:02:28.130> an<00:02:28.310> hour

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
improvement and within half an hour

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.570 
improvement and within half an hour
we've<00:02:29.330> managed<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.050> conduct<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.860> survey<00:02:31.070> can

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
we've managed to conduct a survey can

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.040 
we've managed to conduct a survey can
now<00:02:31.730> head<00:02:31.940> back<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.330> office<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:32.870> that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
now head back to the office it's that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.590 
now head back to the office it's that
quick<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.410> simple<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:34.670> trials<00:02:35.120> here<00:02:35.360> have

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
quick and simple the trials here have

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.810 
quick and simple the trials here have
done<00:02:35.780> really<00:02:36.110> really<00:02:36.260> well<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.550> great

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
done really really well it's a great

point<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:55.190> alternative<00:02:55.490> would<00:02:56.000> be<00:02:56.060> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
point the alternative would be to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.970 
point the alternative would be to
Commission<00:02:56.690> helicopters<00:02:57.350> narrow<00:02:57.620> place

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
Commission helicopters narrow place

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.160 
Commission helicopters narrow place
which<00:02:58.760> obviously<00:02:59.030> cost<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.510> lot<00:02:59.600> more<00:02:59.810> in<00:02:59.960> money

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
which obviously cost a lot more in money

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.740 
which obviously cost a lot more in money
but<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> carbon<00:03:01.430> footprint<00:03:01.850> is<00:03:02.090> huge<00:03:02.390> as<00:03:02.540> well

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
but the carbon footprint is huge as well

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.200 
but the carbon footprint is huge as well
