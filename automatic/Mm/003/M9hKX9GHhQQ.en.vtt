starting here back coming down to 90

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.420 
starting here back coming down to 90
degree<00:00:50.870> actually<00:00:51.870> flushes<00:00:52.280> horizontal<00:00:53.280> here

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
degree actually flushes horizontal here

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.360 
degree actually flushes horizontal here
and<00:00:53.670> actually<00:00:54.270> comes<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:55.010> right<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.160> against
