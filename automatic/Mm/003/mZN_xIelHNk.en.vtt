00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
all right so this is my zx-14 new to me

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.270 
all right so this is my zx-14 new to me
I<00:00:06.170> thought<00:00:07.170> I'd<00:00:07.290> do<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> little<00:00:07.649> video<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.010> if

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
I thought I'd do a little video and if

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.919 
I thought I'd do a little video and if
it<00:00:08.370> sounds<00:00:08.639> like<00:00:08.760> I'm<00:00:08.910> not<00:00:08.940> talking<00:00:09.269> properly

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
it sounds like I'm not talking properly

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.240 
it sounds like I'm not talking properly
it's<00:00:10.050> probably<00:00:10.320> cuz<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> leak<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.219> my

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
it's probably cuz I have a leak in my

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.089 
it's probably cuz I have a leak in my
lung<00:00:11.730> again<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.570> wish<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.620> was<00:00:13.740> kidding<00:00:13.889> about

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
lung again I wish I was kidding about

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.730 
lung again I wish I was kidding about
that<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> spent<00:00:15.809> half<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.199> day<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> ER

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
that but I spent half the day in the ER

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220 
that but I spent half the day in the ER
so<00:00:17.600> good<00:00:18.600> times

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
so good times

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.010 
so good times
this<00:00:20.189> bike<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.699> course<00:00:20.880> fuel-injected<00:00:21.510> so

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
this bike is of course fuel-injected so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.170 
this bike is of course fuel-injected so
it<00:00:22.320> starts<00:00:22.680> up<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.279> cold<00:00:23.460> weather<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:24.029> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it starts up in the cold weather like it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.120 
it starts up in the cold weather like it
is<00:00:24.800> pretty<00:00:25.800> easily<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.960> will<00:00:28.230> start<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:51.150 

hope<00:00:32.130> I'm<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.460> neutral

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.070 

let<00:00:51.670> it<00:00:51.820> run<00:00:51.970> for<00:00:52.270> a<00:00:52.330> little<00:00:52.450> bit<00:00:52.720> cuz<00:00:52.930> it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
let it run for a little bit cuz it's

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.850 
let it run for a little bit cuz it's
cold<00:00:53.380> and<00:00:54.370> then<00:00:54.490> I'll<00:00:54.610> rev<00:00:54.820> it<00:00:55.380> on<00:00:56.380> check<00:00:56.680> out

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
cold and then I'll rev it on check out

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.830 
cold and then I'll rev it on check out
the<00:00:56.980> headlights

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.460 

and<00:01:03.140> high<00:01:03.440> beams

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:18.620 

now<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.190> some<00:01:09.550> elimination

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.679 

while<00:01:18.990> by<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.680> fine<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.420> didn't

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
while by the way I'm fine if I didn't

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.260 
while by the way I'm fine if I didn't
mention<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.280> not<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> worry<00:01:23.670> I'll<00:01:23.909> survive

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
mention that not to worry I'll survive

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.359 
mention that not to worry I'll survive
to<00:01:24.600> ride<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> summer

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.069 

and<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.939> don't<00:01:32.000> care<00:01:32.299> if<00:01:32.329> you<00:01:32.450> see<00:01:32.630> my<00:01:32.780> plate

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
and I don't care if you see my plate

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.320 
and I don't care if you see my plate
because<00:01:33.259> that's<00:01:33.409> not<00:01:33.560> actually<00:01:33.799> my<00:01:34.070> plate

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.180 

yeah<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.110> tell<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.470> cold<00:01:40.710> oh<00:01:40.890> when<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
yeah you can tell it's cold oh when you

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.540 
yeah you can tell it's cold oh when you
can<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> exhaust<00:01:42.980> this<00:01:43.980> is<00:01:44.130> probably<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
can see the exhaust this is probably the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:02:39.680 
can see the exhaust this is probably the
last<00:01:44.670> time<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.000> run<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:45.480> until<00:01:45.780> spring

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:55.330 

Booya

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.160 

and<00:02:55.790> hopefully<00:02:56.150> there's<00:02:56.330> no<00:02:56.510> problems<00:02:56.989> with

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
and hopefully there's no problems with

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.720 
and hopefully there's no problems with
it<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.470> don't<00:02:57.650> know<00:02:57.739> this<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.280> second

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
it I don't know this is like the second

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.350 
it I don't know this is like the second
time<00:02:58.940> I've<00:02:59.180> run<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.569> since<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.900> got<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:05.090> might

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
time I've run it since I got it it might

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.540 
time I've run it since I got it it might
not<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.959> cold<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.530> don't<00:03:06.920> know<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.160> lot<00:03:07.340> of

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
not like the cold I don't know a lot of

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.750 
not like the cold I don't know a lot of
fuel-injected<00:03:08.360> bikes<00:03:09.160> don't<00:03:10.160> really<00:03:10.610> like

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
fuel-injected bikes don't really like

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:24.020 
fuel-injected bikes don't really like
the<00:03:10.910> cold<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.360> seems

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.400 

yeah<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.090> can<00:03:25.390> sure<00:03:25.570> hear<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.840> power<00:03:26.050> in<00:03:26.320> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
yeah you can sure hear the power in the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:45.670 
yeah you can sure hear the power in the
exhaust<00:03:26.770> though

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.619 

don't<00:03:46.310> yell<00:03:46.459> at<00:03:46.519> me<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.909> temperatures<00:03:47.360> coming

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
don't yell at me the temperatures coming

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:55.339 
don't yell at me the temperatures coming
up

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.689 

so<00:03:56.280> that's<00:03:56.400> what<00:03:56.519> I'll<00:03:56.609> be<00:03:56.730> writing<00:03:56.909> in<00:03:57.090> 2013
