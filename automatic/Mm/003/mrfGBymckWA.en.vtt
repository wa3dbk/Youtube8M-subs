having<00:01:30.720> shimmer<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.530> don't

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
having shimmer in it because I don't

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
having shimmer in it because I don't
normally<00:01:31.829> wear<00:01:32.130> shimmer<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.540> bit

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
normally wear shimmer so I was bit

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
normally wear shimmer so I was bit
annoyed<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> didn't<00:01:35.310> say<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.579> was

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
annoyed but because it didn't say it was

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.700 
annoyed but because it didn't say it was
because<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.229> website<00:01:37.619> they

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
because I was like on the website they

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
because I was like on the website they
had<00:01:37.829> pictures<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.490> look<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.790> Sharon<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
had pictures that look like Sharon and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.640 
had pictures that look like Sharon and
not<00:01:39.420> those<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.630> weren't<00:01:39.960> shimmer<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.619> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
not those that weren't shimmer so I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.840 
not those that weren't shimmer so I
didn't<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.369> shimmer<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
didn't think this for shimmer because it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.190 
didn't think this for shimmer because it
didn't<00:01:42.060> look<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.270> shimmer<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> website

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
didn't look like shimmer on the website

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.280 
didn't look like shimmer on the website
but<00:01:43.229> obviously<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.310> i<00:01:44.579> well<00:01:45.060> I'll<00:01:46.020> still

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
but obviously it was i well I'll still

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319 
but obviously it was i well I'll still
use<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.680> something<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:47.070> sure<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
use it for something I'm sure and the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.450 
use it for something I'm sure and the
second<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.780> again<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.680> thought<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.250> going

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
second one again I thought it was going

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.109 
second one again I thought it was going
to<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.030> nude<00:01:51.390> color<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:53.610> really<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> should

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
to be a nude color but really I should

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.580 
to be a nude color but really I should
have<00:01:54.210> read<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> name<00:01:54.780> because<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> name<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
have read the name because the name of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
have read the name because the name of
its<00:01:55.740> opal<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> should<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.240> known

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
its opal so I should have really known

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.520 
its opal so I should have really known
that<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> wasn't<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.439> M<00:02:03.380> muted<00:02:04.380> color

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that it wasn't going to be M muted color

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.469 
that it wasn't going to be M muted color
because<00:02:04.799> opals<00:02:05.250> aren't<00:02:05.670> new<00:02:05.820> they're<00:02:06.119> white

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
because opals aren't new they're white

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.240 
because opals aren't new they're white
and<00:02:06.750> order<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.409> products<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.009> really

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and order for products but it's really

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.070 
and order for products but it's really
nice<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.209> nice<00:02:09.330> nail<00:02:09.569> varnish<00:02:09.899> I'm

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
nice is a really nice nail varnish I'm

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260 
nice is a really nice nail varnish I'm
going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.349> use<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.619> loads<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.940> just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
going to use it loads it's just

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.890 
going to use it loads it's just
completely<00:02:12.690> clear

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
completely clear

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.319 
completely clear
then<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:15.010> goes<00:02:15.189> on<00:02:15.340> really<00:02:15.909> but<00:02:16.209> then

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
then it goes on really but then

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.960 
then it goes on really but then
when<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.540> move<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:17.470> nails<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.400> goes<00:02:18.579> them

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
when you move your nails it goes them

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.000 
when you move your nails it goes them
different<00:02:19.599> colors<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.930> can't<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.379> at<00:02:20.470> all<00:02:20.739> on

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
different colors you can't see at all on

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.679 
different colors you can't see at all on
that's<00:02:21.250> why<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.519> just<00:02:21.819> looks<00:02:22.000> white<00:02:22.209> which<00:02:22.540> is

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
that's why it just looks white which is

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.170 
that's why it just looks white which is
rubbish<00:02:23.019> maybe<00:02:23.920> if<00:02:24.010> i<00:02:24.159> undid<00:02:24.430> thing<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.939> just

learned how to you but I can't and it's

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.710 
learned how to you but I can't and it's
for<00:03:02.439> our<00:03:02.680> hydration<00:03:03.189> but<00:03:04.030> i<00:03:04.209> will<00:03:04.359> not<00:03:04.389> sure<00:03:04.599> if

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
for our hydration but i will not sure if

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.869 
for our hydration but i will not sure if
it<00:03:04.840> well<00:03:05.019> because<00:03:05.349> it's<00:03:06.280> quite<00:03:06.670> watery

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
it well because it's quite watery

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.580 
it well because it's quite watery
because<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.450> called<00:03:07.689> water<00:03:07.900> glass<00:03:08.230> isn't<00:03:08.439> it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
because it's called water glass isn't it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.259 
because it's called water glass isn't it
so<00:03:08.829> i'm<00:03:09.250> not<00:03:09.459> sure<00:03:09.519> if<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.790> will<00:03:09.849> stay<00:03:10.090> on<00:03:10.120> for

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
so i'm not sure if it will stay on for

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.449 
so i'm not sure if it will stay on for
four<00:03:10.540> hours<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:11.049> if<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.799> does<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.340> that's

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
four hours but if it does and that's

sarah jessica parker covet one and it's

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:54.459 
sarah jessica parker covet one and it's
799<00:06:51.409> for<00:06:52.039> the<00:06:52.599> 50<00:06:53.599> ml<00:06:53.779> I<00:06:53.810> think<00:06:54.110> it<00:06:54.229> should<00:06:54.409> be

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:54.469 
799 for the 50 ml I think it should be

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.489 
799 for the 50 ml I think it should be
27<00:06:55.460> so<00:06:55.610> I<00:06:55.669> think<00:06:55.729> it<00:06:55.939> is<00:06:56.029> the<00:06:56.120> 50<00:06:56.449> ml<00:06:56.599> and<00:06:57.080> it

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:57.499 
27 so I think it is the 50 ml and it

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.320 
27 so I think it is the 50 ml and it
just<00:06:57.650> looks<00:06:57.800> so<00:06:57.949> good<00:06:58.129> I've<00:06:58.310> never<00:06:58.819> smell<00:06:59.120> set

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330
