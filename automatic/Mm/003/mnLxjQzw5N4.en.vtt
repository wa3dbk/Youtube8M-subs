00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.730 

so<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.450> thought<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.750> would<00:00:09.870> document<00:00:10.200> my

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
so I thought I would document my

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.799 
so I thought I would document my
generator<00:00:11.490> implementation<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:12.599> at<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
generator implementation here at the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.379 
generator implementation here at the
house<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:14.190> these<00:00:14.490> power<00:00:14.730> outages<00:00:15.210> it

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
house with all these power outages it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.960 
house with all these power outages it
became<00:00:15.660> obvious<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.199> had<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.560> something<00:00:16.980> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
became obvious I had to do something so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.910 
became obvious I had to do something so
after<00:00:18.449> doing<00:00:18.539> some<00:00:18.810> research<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.410> decided<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
after doing some research I decided to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
after doing some research I decided to
go<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.340> Westinghouse<00:00:22.340> 7500<00:00:23.369> wide

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
go with this Westinghouse 7500 wide

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.410 
go with this Westinghouse 7500 wide
generator<00:00:25.250> that<00:00:26.250> has<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:27.199> nice<00:00:28.199> 220<00:00:28.849> output<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
generator that has a nice 220 output and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.819 
generator that has a nice 220 output and
I<00:00:31.410> also<00:00:31.650> decided<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.579> use<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.829> reliance

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
I also decided to use a reliance

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.729 
I also decided to use a reliance
controls<00:00:35.309> transfer<00:00:36.030> switch<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
controls transfer switch and one of the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.520 
controls transfer switch and one of the
things<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.190> came<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> switch<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.239> this

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
things that came with the switch is this

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.130 
things that came with the switch is this
nice<00:00:40.610> cable<00:00:41.610> plugs<00:00:42.329> directly<00:00:42.510> into<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
nice cable plugs directly into the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.760 
nice cable plugs directly into the
generator<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.469> inlet<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
generator and then into the inlet that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.110 
generator and then into the inlet that
I'm<00:00:47.430> gonna<00:00:47.700> show<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.329> next

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.650 

so<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.080> inlet<00:00:55.490> this<00:00:56.490> camp<00:00:57.360> comes

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so this is the inlet this camp comes

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.280 
so this is the inlet this camp comes
with<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.380> kit<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:58.950> reliance<00:00:59.250> controls<00:00:59.790> the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
with the kit from reliance controls the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.870 
with the kit from reliance controls the
the<00:01:01.290> conduit<00:01:01.710> does<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.340> course<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.700> wire

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
the conduit does not of course the wire

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.000 
the conduit does not of course the wire
does<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.440> hook<00:01:04.620> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
does not but this is where you hook the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.700 
does not but this is where you hook the
other<00:01:05.040> end<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.550> wire<00:01:06.650> from<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
other end of that wire from the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
other end of that wire from the
generator<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> sitting<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.660> on

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
generator so I have this sitting out on

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.020 
generator so I have this sitting out on
my<00:01:09.960> brick<00:01:10.710> patio<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:11.910> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
my brick patio it's kind of out in the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.180 
my brick patio it's kind of out in the
open<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.440> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.650> airflow<00:01:13.890> going

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
open so I get a lot of airflow going

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.310 
open so I get a lot of airflow going
around<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.240> easy<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> lure<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
around and it's easy to lure the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
around and it's easy to lure the
generator<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.940> just<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.210> good

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
generator up to it so it's just a good

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
generator up to it so it's just a good
spot<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> kit<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.490> used<00:01:23.760> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
spot so this is the kit that I used this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.859 
spot so this is the kit that I used this
is<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> reliance<00:01:24.720> controls<00:01:25.369> kit<00:01:26.780> comes<00:01:27.780> with

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
is the reliance controls kit comes with

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.320 
is the reliance controls kit comes with
this<00:01:28.140> transfer<00:01:28.710> switch<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.880> wires<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
this transfer switch all the wires and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.440 
this transfer switch all the wires and
everything<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> need<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> external<00:01:32.880> box<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
everything you need the external box I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.180 
everything you need the external box I
already<00:01:33.630> showed<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.140> plus<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> cable<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> go

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
already showed you plus the cable to go

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.940 
already showed you plus the cable to go
right<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> generator<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.680> just

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right to generator and you know just

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.190 
right to generator and you know just
illustrates<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.580> going<00:01:38.820> into<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.270> going

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
illustrates it going into your going

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.070 
illustrates it going into your going
into<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.590> box<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> kind<00:01:46.020> of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
into your box so this is the kind of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.029 
into your box so this is the kind of
wire<00:01:46.289> I<00:01:46.320> used<00:01:47.450> recommended<00:01:48.450> wires<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:49.039> three

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
wire I used recommended wires a three

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.830 
wire I used recommended wires a three
wire<00:01:50.940> 10<00:01:51.479> gauge<00:01:52.250> with<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.850> grounding<00:01:54.300> wire<00:01:54.450> so

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
wire 10 gauge with one grounding wire so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.719 
wire 10 gauge with one grounding wire so
pick<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.070> at<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> local<00:01:56.490> home

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
pick this up at the local home

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.809 
pick this up at the local home
improvement<00:01:56.759> store<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.369> frankly<00:01:59.789> I

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
improvement store and you know frankly I

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.029 
improvement store and you know frankly I
spend<00:02:00.119> most<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.360> my<00:02:00.420> time<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.709> fighting

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
spend most of my time you know fighting

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.620 
spend most of my time you know fighting
with<00:02:02.220> this<00:02:02.340> heavy<00:02:02.520> gauge<00:02:02.819> wire<00:02:02.850> getting<00:02:03.569> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
with this heavy gauge wire getting it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.260 
with this heavy gauge wire getting it
from<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.130> from<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> outside<00:02:05.280> outlet<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.179> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
from the from the outside outlet all the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.419 
from the from the outside outlet all the
way<00:02:06.360> through<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.800> condo<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:07.950> everything<00:02:08.280> else

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
way through my condo and everything else

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
way through my condo and everything else
but<00:02:08.759> that's<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.179> most<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.599> time<00:02:09.840> went<00:02:10.080> but

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
but that's what most of my time went but

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.270 
but that's what most of my time went but
this<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> wire<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.220> use

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.140 

okay<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.690> transfer<00:02:18.200> switch<00:02:19.150> this

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
okay so this is the transfer switch this

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.440 
okay so this is the transfer switch this
is<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> conduit<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.530> used<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.070> run<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.490> to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
is the conduit that I used to run the to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.540 
is the conduit that I used to run the to
run<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.990> wire<00:02:24.170> from<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.500> inlet<00:02:24.890> into<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.340> box

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
run the wire from the inlet into the box

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.190 
run the wire from the inlet into the box
so<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.910> comes<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.240> over<00:02:26.480> here<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.750> then<00:02:26.960> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
so it comes in over here and then the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.020 
so it comes in over here and then the
four<00:02:27.410> wires<00:02:27.650> just<00:02:28.040> get<00:02:28.220> connected<00:02:28.490> in<00:02:28.820> here

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
four wires just get connected in here

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.840 
four wires just get connected in here
with<00:02:29.150> wire<00:02:29.390> nuts<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:31.250> know<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.550> I

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
with wire nuts and you know this I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.250 
with wire nuts and you know this I
didn't<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.270> open<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.959> work<00:02:33.140> on

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
didn't have to open this up to work on

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.780 
didn't have to open this up to work on
this<00:02:33.440> at<00:02:33.620> all<00:02:33.770> other<00:02:34.040> than<00:02:34.130> just<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.459> hook<00:02:34.610> up

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
this at all other than just to hook up

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.330 
this at all other than just to hook up
those<00:02:34.970> four<00:02:35.240> wires<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.680> part<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.100> kit

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
those four wires this is part of the kit

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.080 
those four wires this is part of the kit
and<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.820> tapped<00:02:38.180> into<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.680> main<00:02:39.920> box<00:02:40.250> over

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
and I tapped into the the main box over

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.180 
and I tapped into the the main box over
here<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:42.140> left<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.500> already<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> sub

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
here on the left I already have a sub

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.010 
here on the left I already have a sub
box<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:43.850> was<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.240> most<00:02:44.420> convenient<00:02:44.840> way

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
box so this was the most convenient way

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.350 
box so this was the most convenient way
for<00:02:45.080> me<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.530> do<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.760> all<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:47.030> stuff

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
for me to do this and all this stuff

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.030 
for me to do this and all this stuff
back<00:02:47.600> here<00:02:47.870> all<00:02:47.990> this<00:02:48.110> mess<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.560> basically

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
back here all this mess is basically

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.880 
back here all this mess is basically
cable<00:02:49.550> TV<00:02:49.940> stuff<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.200> satellite<00:02:51.650> dish

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
cable TV stuff and satellite dish

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.280 
cable TV stuff and satellite dish
whatever<00:02:52.360> but<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.630> know<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.200> only

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
whatever but you know this is the only

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.330 
whatever but you know this is the only
connection<00:02:54.830> right<00:02:54.950> into<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.370> box<00:03:03.280> okay<00:03:04.280> so

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
connection right into this box okay so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.150 
connection right into this box okay so
I'm<00:03:04.580> looking<00:03:04.880> on<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> inside<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.540> box<00:03:05.780> now

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
I'm looking on the inside of the box now

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.280 
I'm looking on the inside of the box now
the<00:03:07.160> transfer<00:03:08.090> switch<00:03:08.300> connection<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.080> right

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
the transfer switch connection is right

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.750 
the transfer switch connection is right
right<00:03:09.650> here<00:03:09.890> where<00:03:10.070> all<00:03:10.100> these<00:03:10.280> wires<00:03:10.550> are

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
right here where all these wires are

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.520 
right here where all these wires are
coming<00:03:10.940> up<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.750> everything<00:03:12.080> that's<00:03:12.170> coming<00:03:12.500> up

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
coming up so everything that's coming up

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.780 
coming up so everything that's coming up
through<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.830> bottom<00:03:13.160> here<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.400> coming<00:03:13.670> from

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
through the bottom here is coming from

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.970 
through the bottom here is coming from
the<00:03:13.970> transfer<00:03:14.450> switch<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.500> basically

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
the transfer switch and basically

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.310 
the transfer switch and basically
there's<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.340> matched<00:03:16.610> pair<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:17.390> black<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.230> red

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
there's a matched pair of black and red

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.080 
there's a matched pair of black and red
wires<00:03:18.760> for<00:03:19.760> each<00:03:21.340> each<00:03:22.340> connection<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
wires for each each connection on the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
wires for each each connection on the
transfer<00:03:23.540> switch<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.380> match<00:03:24.830> those<00:03:25.160> up

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
transfer switch so you match those up

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.370 
transfer switch so you match those up
and<00:03:25.670> go<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.120> circuit<00:03:26.630> that<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.989> want<00:03:27.230> to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
and go to the circuit that you want to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.620 
and go to the circuit that you want to
wire<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.640> circuit<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.209> have<00:03:29.420> on<00:03:29.600> a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
wire in to that circuit and have on a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.900 
wire in to that circuit and have on a
generator<00:03:30.500> back<00:03:30.769> up<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.610> as<00:03:31.700> an<00:03:31.820> example

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
generator back up so as an example

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.449

two<00:04:01.190> red<00:04:01.400> wires<00:04:01.579> up<00:04:01.850> here<00:04:02.060> that's<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.930> one

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
two red wires up here that's the the one

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.430 
two red wires up here that's the the one
220<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:03.829> did<00:04:04.100> use<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.810> allows<00:04:05.810> me<00:04:06.110> to

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
220 that I did use that allows me to

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.680 
220 that I did use that allows me to
actually<00:04:06.829> get<00:04:07.130> heating<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.519> house<00:04:07.700> with

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
actually get heating the house with

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.660 
actually get heating the house with
running<00:04:09.530> off<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.769> generator<00:04:10.190> because<00:04:10.370> my

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
running off the generator because my

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.850 
running off the generator because my
boiler<00:04:11.180> is<00:04:11.360> actually<00:04:11.780> my<00:04:11.959> emergency<00:04:12.620> backup

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
boiler is actually my emergency backup

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.490 
boiler is actually my emergency backup
from<00:04:13.370> my<00:04:13.549> heat<00:04:13.790> pump<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.989> that<00:04:15.019> worked<00:04:15.350> out

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
from my heat pump so that worked out

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.590 
from my heat pump so that worked out
really<00:04:15.769> nice<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.310> I've<00:04:17.299> got<00:04:17.479> the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
really nice and I've got the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.509 
really nice and I've got the
refrigerator<00:04:18.109> freezer

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
refrigerator freezer

coffeemaker which is vital and I had
some<00:04:23.750> other<00:04:23.900> circuits<00:04:24.410> come<00:04:24.590> over<00:04:24.830> here<00:04:25.099> to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
some other circuits come over here to

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.870 
some other circuits come over here to

got you know some key lights and so

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.929 
got you know some key lights and so
forth<00:04:34.409> so<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:34.889> know<00:04:35.249> it<00:04:35.429> worked<00:04:35.639> out<00:04:35.789> pretty

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
forth so you know it worked out pretty

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:39.709 
forth so you know it worked out pretty
good<00:04:36.139> now<00:04:37.139> surprisingly<00:04:37.589> enough<00:04:38.509> two<00:04:39.509> days

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
good now surprisingly enough two days

good now surprisingly enough two days
after<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:40.139> got<00:04:40.229> this<00:04:40.499> all<00:04:40.709> hooked<00:04:41.009> up<00:04:41.129> and<00:04:42.089> test

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
after we got this all hooked up and test

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.149 
after we got this all hooked up and test
it<00:04:42.629> out<00:04:42.779> we<00:04:43.259> actually<00:04:43.529> had<00:04:43.619> a<00:04:43.649> power<00:04:43.919> outage

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159

and that power ID is gone for ten hours

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:48.350 
and that power ID is gone for ten hours
it<00:04:47.069> was<00:04:47.129> very<00:04:47.339> local<00:04:47.729> there's<00:04:47.879> only<00:04:48.059> a<00:04:48.149> few

it was very local there's only a few
houses<00:04:48.839> at<00:04:49.229> route<00:04:49.409> we<00:04:49.619> were<00:04:49.799> just<00:04:49.949> one<00:04:50.189> of<00:04:50.279> the

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:50.399 
houses at route we were just one of the

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.489 
houses at route we were just one of the
you<00:04:50.759> know<00:04:50.789> unfortunate<00:04:51.569> few<00:04:51.779> that<00:04:52.019> lost<00:04:52.229> power

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:52.499 
you know unfortunate few that lost power

but<00:04:53.339> you<00:04:53.639> know<00:04:53.759> I<00:04:53.789> hooked<00:04:54.089> up<00:04:54.209> to<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.449> generator

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
but you know I hooked up to a generator

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.489 
but you know I hooked up to a generator
fired<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.759> up<00:04:56.849> through<00:04:57.329> the<00:04:57.449> switches<00:04:57.689> and<00:04:58.289> we

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
fired it up through the switches and we

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:59.929 
fired it up through the switches and we
were<00:04:58.619> in<00:04:58.739> business<00:04:59.129> we<00:04:59.309> were<00:04:59.459> very
