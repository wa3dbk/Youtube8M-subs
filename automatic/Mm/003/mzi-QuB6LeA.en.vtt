00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.270 
in the opening of this episode in the
opening<00:03:19.720> credits<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.680> I'm<00:03:20.770> assuming<00:03:21.010> we're

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
opening credits so I'm assuming we're

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.100 
opening credits so I'm assuming we're
gonna<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.580> new<00:03:21.790> villainous<00:03:22.330> team<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.990> a

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
gonna have a new villainous team in a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.390 
gonna have a new villainous team in a
sense<00:03:23.380> even<00:03:23.530> though<00:03:23.710> they're<00:03:23.830> not<00:03:23.860> villains

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
sense even though they're not villains

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.430 
sense even though they're not villains
they're<00:03:24.580> just<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:24.910> know<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.090> antagonist<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
they're just you know the antagonist the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.280 
they're just you know the antagonist the
adversaries<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.520> our<00:03:27.640> heroes<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.720> maybe<00:03:29.050> means

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
adversaries of our heroes so maybe means

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.420 
adversaries of our heroes so maybe means
you're<00:03:29.440> sued<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.770> will<00:03:29.890> come<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.160> their<00:03:30.280> aid

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
you're sued you will come to their aid

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.730 
you're sued you will come to their aid
at<00:03:30.640> one<00:03:30.760> point<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.210> don't<00:03:31.390> know<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.750> don't<00:03:32.590> know

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
at one point I don't know I don't know

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.530 
at one point I don't know I don't know
if<00:03:32.860> this<00:03:32.980> dude's<00:03:33.220> gonna<00:03:33.400> show<00:03:33.640> up<00:03:33.820> after<00:03:34.390> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
if this dude's gonna show up after the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.240 
if this dude's gonna show up after the
inter<00:03:34.690> high<00:03:34.840> course<00:03:35.170> or<00:03:35.470> if<00:03:35.650> he's<00:03:35.830> gonna<00:03:36.010> show

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
inter high course or if he's gonna show

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.720 
inter high course or if he's gonna show
up<00:03:36.370> in<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.760> third<00:03:37.650> third<00:03:38.650> race<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.580> air

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
up in the third third race of the air

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.780 
up in the third third race of the air
high<00:03:39.910> because<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:41.220> think<00:03:42.220> we<00:03:42.310> would<00:03:42.460> have<00:03:42.490> seen

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
high because I think we would have seen

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.400 
high because I think we would have seen
this<00:03:42.970> guy<00:03:43.180> already<00:03:43.420> if<00:03:43.600> he<00:03:43.780> was<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.080> much<00:03:44.230> of

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
this guy already if he was that much of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.800 
this guy already if he was that much of
an<00:03:44.500> opponent<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.910> know<00:03:46.030> capable<00:03:46.600> of

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
an opponent and that you know capable of

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.390 
an opponent and that you know capable of
an<00:03:46.930> adversary<00:03:47.470> we<00:03:47.680> were<00:03:47.800> seeing<00:03:48.130> them<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
an adversary we were seeing them in the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.550 
an adversary we were seeing them in the
first<00:03:48.610> season<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.270> I<00:03:49.510> have<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.990> feeling<00:03:50.410> we're

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
first season so I have a feeling we're

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.440 
first season so I have a feeling we're
gonna<00:03:50.650> get<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.980> end<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:52.000> inter<00:03:52.270> high

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
gonna get the end of the inter high

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.930 
gonna get the end of the inter high
during<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.380> season<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:54.040> your<00:03:54.310> Musha<00:03:54.640> petal

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
during this season of your Musha petal

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.210 
during this season of your Musha petal
and<00:03:55.090> then<00:03:55.840> we're<00:03:55.960> gonna<00:03:56.080> go<00:03:56.350> beyond<00:03:56.920> that

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
and then we're gonna go beyond that

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.620 
and then we're gonna go beyond that
we're<00:03:57.370> gonna<00:03:57.460> see<00:03:57.670> what's<00:03:57.940> after<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.510> inner

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
we're gonna see what's after the inner

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.160 
we're gonna see what's after the inner
high<00:03:58.870> for<00:03:59.260> these<00:03:59.440> characters<00:04:01.020> they're<00:04:02.020> also

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
high for these characters they're also

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.470 
high for these characters they're also
making<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.830> think<00:04:03.010> there's<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.400> 3d<00:04:03.700> s<00:04:03.820> game<00:04:04.060> based

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
making I think there's a 3d s game based

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.390 
making I think there's a 3d s game based
on<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.170> it's<00:04:05.500> set<00:04:05.770> after<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> inner

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
on this and it's set after the inner

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.370 
on this and it's set after the inner
high<00:04:06.640> while<00:04:06.880> they're<00:04:07.210> at<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.360> training<00:04:07.720> camp<00:04:07.870> so

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
high while they're at a training camp so

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.320 
high while they're at a training camp so
I'm<00:04:09.040> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.370> assume<00:04:09.670> it's<00:04:09.880> gonna<00:04:09.940> tie<00:04:10.270> in

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
I'm going to assume it's gonna tie in

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.120 
I'm going to assume it's gonna tie in
with<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.570> video<00:04:10.870> game<00:04:11.080> somewhat<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.920> maybe

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
with the video game somewhat so maybe

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.410 
with the video game somewhat so maybe
they're<00:04:12.310> gonna<00:04:12.400> go<00:04:12.550> to<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.670> training<00:04:13.000> camp<00:04:13.120> and

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
they're gonna go to a training camp and

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.540 
they're gonna go to a training camp and
they're<00:04:13.510> gonna<00:04:13.600> go<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.930> more<00:04:14.310> national<00:04:15.310> stage

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
they're gonna go to more national stage

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.430 
they're gonna go to more national stage
I'd<00:04:15.790> be<00:04:15.910> awesome<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.390> see<00:04:16.570> or<00:04:16.840> even<00:04:17.049> be<00:04:17.290> cool

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
I'd be awesome to see or even be cool

that'd<00:04:28.990> be<00:04:29.110> cool<00:04:29.259> to<00:04:29.380> see<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:29.650> well<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.100> I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
that'd be cool to see as well but I

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.090 
that'd be cool to see as well but I
don't<00:04:30.520> think<00:04:30.789> we'll<00:04:31.030> get<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.419> in<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:32.100> this

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
don't think we'll get that in this this

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.640 
don't think we'll get that in this this
season<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.610> think<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.060> will<00:04:34.180> come<00:04:34.330> into<00:04:34.539> a

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
season I think that will come into a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.560 
season I think that will come into a
later<00:04:35.650> season<00:04:35.979> if<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.820> even<00:04:37.060> goes<00:04:37.180> down<00:04:37.419> that

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
later season if that even goes down that

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.300 
later season if that even goes down that
way<00:04:37.630> because<00:04:38.289> I<00:04:38.410> know<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.650> bog<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.949> so<00:04:39.100> long
