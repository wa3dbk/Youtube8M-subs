00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it's reason cell it's normally you know

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.460 
it's reason cell it's normally you know
perfect<00:00:25.590> cell<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> final<00:00:27.180> form<00:00:27.390> Frieza<00:00:27.630> maybe

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
perfect cell and final form Frieza maybe

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.890 
perfect cell and final form Frieza maybe
for<00:00:28.830> frizzy<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:30.510> first<00:00:30.720> one

for frizzy you think the first one
little<00:00:31.619> bit<00:00:31.740> bits<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.460> generally<00:00:33.559> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
little bit bits is generally the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
little bit bits is generally the
watershed<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.430> fight<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.820> no<00:00:36.030> idea

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
watershed put this fight I have no idea

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.049 
watershed put this fight I have no idea

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
I'm can really think about that um ha

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.840 
I'm can really think about that um ha
let's<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.629> them<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:40.020> yeah<00:00:40.460> that's<00:00:41.460> done

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
let's do them in there yeah that's done

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
let's do them in there yeah that's done
there<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.360> no<00:00:42.450> real<00:00:42.629> reason<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.760> yeah<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
there for no real reason but yeah so

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.979 
there for no real reason but yeah so
what<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.329> about<00:00:45.450> these<00:00:45.600> two<00:00:45.660> it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
what do you think about these two it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
what do you think about these two it's
just<00:00:46.260> normally<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> final<00:00:47.160> forms<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.550> most

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
just normally the final forms one most

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180 
just normally the final forms one most
powerful<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
powerful because that's when they do the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.610 
powerful because that's when they do the
most<00:00:50.280> fighting<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.760> stuff<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.620> pretty

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
most fighting and stuff but I'm pretty

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
most fighting and stuff but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:57.980> have<00:00:58.980> any<00:00:59.100> special<00:00:59.430> dialogue<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.910> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
sure have any special dialogue if you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.580 
sure have any special dialogue if you
have<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.329> violent<00:01:00.840> form<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.170> special

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
have them violent form they have special

you are gonna get disqualified if you
keep<00:01:45.310> breaking<00:01:45.520> up<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.850> stage<00:01:46.090> cell<00:01:46.500> get

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
keep breaking up the stage cell get

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.780 
keep breaking up the stage cell get
around<00:01:47.650> here<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.100> hopefully<00:01:48.130> they<00:01:48.550> won't

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
around here so hopefully they won't

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.060 
around here so hopefully they won't
transform<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:50.260> I'm<00:01:50.350> trying<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.620> fight<00:01:50.890> them

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
transform and I'm trying to fight them

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.340 
transform and I'm trying to fight them
but<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:52.090> never<00:01:52.270> know<00:01:52.479> sometimes<00:01:52.870> they<00:01:53.229> do

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
but you never know sometimes they do

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.330 
but you never know sometimes they do
something<00:01:53.770> in<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.890> dough<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.010> think<00:01:54.220> it's

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
something in the dough I think it's

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.510 
something in the dough I think it's
pretty<00:01:54.460> rare<00:01:55.110> ai<00:01:56.110> transforming<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.160> this<00:01:57.310> oh

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
pretty rare ai transforming in this oh

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.570 
pretty rare ai transforming in this oh
shit<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:58.180> mash<00:01:58.710> now<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.830> do<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.010> button<00:02:00.430> mash

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
shit but mash now to do that button mash

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.340 
shit but mash now to do that button mash

now but well you got that I was pretty
it<00:02:55.180> was<00:02:55.330> pretty<00:02:55.780> easy<00:02:55.990> even<00:02:56.290> though<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.380> think

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
it was pretty easy even though I think

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.410 
it was pretty easy even though I think
freezes<00:02:58.060> powers<00:02:58.480> like<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.880> 500<00:03:00.880> thousands

Android 17 Android 60 and I can't
remember<00:03:11.110> which<00:03:11.290> one<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.620> stronger<00:03:11.830> but<00:03:12.220> I

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
remember which one is stronger but I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.550 
remember which one is stronger but I
guess<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.030> doesn't<00:03:13.150> really<00:03:13.240> matter<00:03:13.390> if<00:03:13.780> you

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
guess it doesn't really matter if you

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.260 
guess it doesn't really matter if you
girl<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.800> around<00:03:15.040> piccolo<00:03:15.730> strength<00:03:16.120> or

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
girl is around piccolo strength or

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.360 
girl is around piccolo strength or
something<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.780> really<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.260> no<00:03:17.530> idea<00:03:17.800> but<00:03:18.070> I

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
something I really have no idea but I

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.080 
something I really have no idea but I
guess<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.390> doesn't<00:03:19.570> matter<00:03:19.690> now<00:03:20.850> once<00:03:21.850> he<00:03:21.940> got

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
guess it doesn't matter now once he got

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.520 
guess it doesn't matter now once he got
those<00:03:22.240> absorptions<00:03:22.960> he<00:03:23.140> was<00:03:23.230> pretty<00:03:23.440> much

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.080 
those absorptions he was pretty much
stronger<00:03:23.800> than<00:03:23.950> everyone<00:03:24.220> else<00:03:24.400> but<00:03:24.820> can<00:03:24.970> go

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
stronger than everyone else but can go
