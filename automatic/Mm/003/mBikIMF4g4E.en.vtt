have the new Vinci planetary gear system

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
have the new Vinci planetary gear system
what<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> means<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.590> an

this and what will have new for 2013 is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.389 
this and what will have new for 2013 is
the<00:00:40.920> gates<00:00:41.489> carbon<00:00:42.329> drive<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.200> together<00:00:43.500> you

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the gates carbon drive so together you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.779 
the gates carbon drive so together you
have<00:00:45.440> simplicity<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> bike<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
have simplicity you have a bike that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.630 
have simplicity you have a bike that
rides<00:00:48.030> smoothly<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:49.500> an<00:00:49.710> infinite<00:00:50.250> number

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
rides smoothly with an infinite number

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
rides smoothly with an infinite number
of<00:00:50.670> gear<00:00:51.270> options<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.160> doesn't

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of gear options and it really doesn't

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.020 
of gear options and it really doesn't
get<00:00:53.760> much<00:00:54.239> easier<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:55.250> all<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.760> is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
get much easier because all you do is

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.110 
get much easier because all you do is
turn<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.750> simple<00:00:58.050> knob<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.120> match

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
turn this simple knob here and match

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.150 
turn this simple knob here and match
your<00:01:00.359> icon<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.050> terrain<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.980> you're

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
your icon to the terrain so if you're

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.600 
your icon to the terrain so if you're
going<00:01:02.370> uphill<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.199> just<00:01:04.220> create<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> mountain

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
going uphill you just create a mountain

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.920 
going uphill you just create a mountain
here<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.880> you're<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> flats<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.780> can

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
here if you're on the flats you can

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
here if you're on the flats you can
flatten<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.119> notice

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
flatten it right out and if you notice

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.070 
flatten it right out and if you notice
you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.780> shift<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:11.390> while<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:12.630> standing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you can shift it while you're standing

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.649 
you can shift it while you're standing
still<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.530> while<00:01:13.860> you're<00:01:14.040> pedaling<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.909> there

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
still or while you're pedaling and there

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.109 
still or while you're pedaling and there
is<00:01:15.780> no<00:01:16.049> click<00:01:16.380> click<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.340> absolutely

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
is no click click it is absolutely

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.260 
is no click click it is absolutely
silent<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.900> absolutely<00:01:19.680> smooth<00:01:20.009> add<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.970> to

silent and absolutely smooth add that to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.070 
silent and absolutely smooth add that to
the<00:01:22.460> folding<00:01:23.460> ability<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.420> bike<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the folding ability of this bike and you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
the folding ability of this bike and you
have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> bike<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.890> incredibly<00:01:26.640> versatile

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
have a bike that is incredibly versatile

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.679 
have a bike that is incredibly versatile
for<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.080> about<00:01:28.229> any<00:01:28.619> person<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.640> most<00:01:30.450> sizes
