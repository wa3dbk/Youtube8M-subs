00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.620
 dear ladies and gentlemen we are 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.720
 yes on the company premises 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.450
 europe in the lower Bavarian zittel 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.800
 tax for see in the background the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.000
 europe why the nawaro mouse is made 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.980
 from a converted euromaus three 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.430
 Vienna was a mouse suitable for loading 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.530
 So all capable goods are actually 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.830
 the thing to be invented for charging 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.110
 chopped ice with it so that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.090
 Waste vehicle from the shredder on the terrain 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.240
 transported and rented there 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.580
 is the one then again and again the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.580
 rented under space underground used 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.130
 on it again loads away running truck around the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.220
 chop corn from the transport with 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.050
 a truck in more than ten kilometers 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.570
 Transport distance is the use of 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.000
 Machine economically compares it 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.810
 to peace transport the truck transport 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.770
 plus more why cheaper than 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.010
 the transport with the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.330
 agricultural vehicle 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.580
 but that was actually invented 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.050
 By now, you do not only know that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.390
 You can load the corn but you can 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.489
 Also such wood chips very nice 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.680
 We can load such schnitzel here 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:46.370
 in about 50 cubic meters in five minutes 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.870
 lost as an excellent achievement 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.370
 We have a customer has the machine 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.260
 already used in order to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.220
 Great hall wheat on the trucks 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.920
 to load 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.320
 much less diesel consumption than 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.049
 a wheel loader or telescopic loader with 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.269
 significantly more charging power yes the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.030
 nawaro mouse has a working width of 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.299
 Well eight meters recording so we can 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.790
 the sides snail and this big one 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.900
 cuts at the middle part separate 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.989
 set the speed of the medium snail 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.299
 is also adjustable in height 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.680
 he has the task what the sides 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.390
 promote snails purely 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.030
 towards the back in the abdominal belt too 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.640
 The ribbons will be handed over at the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.620
 machine all remodeled open-minded 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.209
 executions so that as little as possible 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.930
 can deliver so closed 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.430
 bender here 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.420
 This machine has been expanding year 2007 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.690
 8500 operating hours on the hydraulics 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.220
 axes gear motor are thus having to 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.250
 1000 hours I broke 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.410
 We now have five machines 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.750
 that's the sixth one here now 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.940
 machine meanwhile have the conversion 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.490
 as far as constructed from my use 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.130
 the euromaus three we at ours 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.260
 Customer is department to work 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.420
 weak time with customers in the staff 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.680
 to her tree to know what to ask 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.050
 we frame the old recordings 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.150
 Cut off the new parts of food 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.040
 So the parts are all too far 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.209
 that we designed the machines 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.299
 easily from existing used 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.370
 can convert machines and hope 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.980
 Now that the market there is for 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.410
 and in the years to come and to 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.110
 yes that would take time the most important to 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.670
 europe why an interesting one 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.790
 Machine for all those in the construction truck 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.650
 Commodity sector in the biomass scene 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.550
 are active and here is a logistics 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.360
 people need 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.930
 thanks for the attention and 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.930
 Greetings from middle city
