00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.660
 and what the good youtube sun has done 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.700
 this video as you are seeing it is for 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.090
 announce let's say a new team that I'm going 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.189
 to form and then obviously that as 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.100
 you know I left the resurrection 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.610
 good 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.860
 before I want to clarify that I do not know 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.710
 they put the questions back because they wanted 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.910
 know about the whole subject of these for 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:35.030
 process a little faster 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.430
 because they ask me they put me because 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.280
 Thermal stop for that is simple and not 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.730
 did not fit in with them and all that either 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.370
 actually, basically mesaline in 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.850
 what tim you are now says the book so 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.220
 you can form a new team 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.970
 effectively and I still do not know to what 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.450
 someone I'm going to put 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.130
 he says to put me again team at the end I'm going 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.050
 to say at the end I should say how they are going 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.470
 to be able to join with to be able to send messages 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.590
 to join and say no for me they will continue 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 speaking, I did not have any problems 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.950
 go through me I can continue talking 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.540
 I do not know if they are angry apparently 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.310
 so he put shock because what yes 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.260
 but I do not have any problem 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.330
 with them in fact, I wish them 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.330
 I wish good luck on your computer and it says 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.570
 competing will continue to compete with the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.220
 ulises and yes yes it will continue 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.690
 competing is not something that I like and not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.870
 there is nothing else to do to get out 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.480
 team up 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.480
 let's see another sale 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.759
 they fought because I did not fight to be me 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.649
 I just left the team like I already 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.159
 I mentioned I was not comfortable with other 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.740
 reasons more obviously but then I do not 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.159
 I fought with them since you will receive the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.650
 video and there will be your new good clip 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.250
 as I said 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:07.880
 let's see let's see this let's go the first 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:11.580
 team is the team is going to call 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.260
 brilliance that name I already have it 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.570
 made here on the right they will be 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.600
 looking logical that is from the team 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.250
 obviously it's something simple I'll see if 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.810
 I try to improve or talk to someone 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.380
 to help me be better or me 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.650

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.940
