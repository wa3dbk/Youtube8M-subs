not<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> glitch<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.550> just<00:03:42.790> another<00:03:43.060> method<00:03:43.570> it's

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
not a glitch is just another method it's

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.620 
not a glitch is just another method it's
an<00:03:43.960> ability<00:03:44.320> that<00:03:44.680> has<00:03:45.160> been<00:03:45.820> put<00:03:46.120> forth<00:03:46.390> on<00:03:46.600> a

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.300 
an ability that has been put forth on a
gun<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.050> it<00:03:47.080> can't<00:03:47.410> be<00:03:47.470> patched<00:03:47.800> because<00:03:48.160> it's

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
gun so it can't be patched because it's

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.420 
gun so it can't be patched because it's
an<00:03:48.370> ability<00:03:48.930> if<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.560> if<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.800> an<00:03:50.920> ability<00:03:51.190> that

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
an ability if so if is an ability that

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.760 
an ability if so if is an ability that
means<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.820> can<00:03:52.030> use<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:53.170> not<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.440> glitch

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
means you can use it it's not a glitch

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.820 
means you can use it it's not a glitch
it's<00:03:54.040> an<00:03:54.220> ability<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.930> an<00:03:56.080> ability<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.620> is

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
it's an ability it's an ability that is

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.220 
it's an ability it's an ability that is
made<00:03:57.070> by<00:03:57.310> another<00:03:57.730> gun<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.600> you<00:03:58.630> can<00:03:58.930> stack

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
made by another gun that you can stack

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.550 
made by another gun that you can stack
to<00:03:59.440> another<00:03:59.770> gun<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:01.390> therefore<00:04:01.600> i'm<00:04:02.050> using

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
to another gun so therefore i'm using

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.060 
to another gun so therefore i'm using
