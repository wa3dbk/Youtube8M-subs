00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.700
 channel and chase the abbot falls this 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.799
 really one of those players for the sake of 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.590
 which people sit and open 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:57.400
 silver instead of gold packs and we he 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.920
 falls into premium packs so silver 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.250
 until became all just two 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.530
 on the cover of antoine grizzmann and in a pack 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.840
 will fall on the murillo here if I perform a rel 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.620
 it would certainly be much nicer 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.209
 but this guy is useful to me shown 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.860
 in the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.489

 antoine grizzmann let's some in 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.129
 form of what would be straightforward for the beauty of kelvin 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.769
 kelvin 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.420
 this guy now costs about 20 thousand 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.299
 dream 14 hi-fi 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.799

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.590
 wonder five stars killer dubai 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.849
 I donâ€™t know the video now who we cut and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.690
 just the same and for whom we cut now 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:47.290
 kelvin is cheaper than last staphy 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:51.660

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.229
 the silver packs turned out to be more 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.549
 tatar than gold today 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.590
