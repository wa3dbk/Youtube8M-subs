00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.269
 look for that and continue 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.550
 rich of images has microsoft 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.490
 windows 8 1 own app the photos app 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.519
 donated so are numerous 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.170
 options available but am 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.060
 Of course, the beginning is the insertion of the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.580
 pictures so how come the pictures 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 for example, from the hard disk 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 the tablet so it keeps coming back 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.760
 I would like to see them in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.580
 show this video 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.750
 open here so the photos aep there 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.190
 Do you ever see the same 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.670
 different ways you 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.320
 have to represent pictures on the tablet 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.900
 Of course, this includes your own 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.780
 library on the tablet or record 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.930
 also a hard disk but also skydrive 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.090
 as pictures of facebook are flickr and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.490
 various devices on the tablet 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.530
 are connected 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.050
 look at us as normal as pictures 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.270
 get into the library here like you 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.900
 right now is the library 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.870
 still empty 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.470
 but there is a whole way to it 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.710
 remedy 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.630
 open the desktop app 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.490
 windows explorer 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.490
 and branch to it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.500
 on which her pictures are in the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.640
 case is that here multimedia de 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.640
 touch the picture folder 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.930
 go to the folder with your fingers 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.910
 if I stay longer 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.340
 and here you can tap in 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.689
 record a library 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.689
 and pictures 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.760
 she will be here 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.620
 away from windows in the folder folder that 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.900
 drive latched 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.900
 go back to the photo app 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.030
 then they look as if by magic 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.990
 Here are the pictures that are in 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.990
 this drive 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.620
 that is the one variant 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 and one was 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.230
 that means you turn in the desktop 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.060
 go and use the pictures instead 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.130
 folder to link here 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.890
 Just go here by drag and drop 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.430
 and copy the pictures into the folder 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430
 images 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.030
 and already lay 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.310
 pictures there and then they do not have to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.080
 every time the hard drive with the tablet 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.879
 but have full access 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.879
 on your picture library 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.680
 see you go back then you have 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.500
 the different pictures you have now 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.850
 on the tablet have copied those are 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.950
 the different possibilities you 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.110
 with the photos app in it would be careful 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.110
 and to view and play pictures
