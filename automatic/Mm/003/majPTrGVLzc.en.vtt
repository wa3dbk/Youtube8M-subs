00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello to all and with that of tess 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.020
 mobile.fr we are at ifa 2014 on the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.430
 alcatel stand that presents us his 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.840
 tablet 08 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.879
 so I say tablet it's not 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.890
 exactly one tablet is it is 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.360
 going to say fable is to the extent that we 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.980
 can be a sim card but hey we can 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.119
 make calls after 8 inches 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.099
 so for me it's still a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.169
 tablet is not going to walk down the street 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.580
 with that step after you do 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.949
 exactly what you want 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.940
 heard then at the level of the specs that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 we have an 8 inch screen 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.660
 1920 1200 see that this ratio 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.710
 maybe a little bit different from that 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.480
 we are used to seeing 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.550
 not necessarily sure on the tablets of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 this template one but compared to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.449
 others of other terminals we have a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.190
 media library processor octo cores i 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.510
 I do not know how much she is 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 clocked it is not registered in the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.430
 specs so but it's good this October 10th 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.840
 body we have two gigas of ram 16 giga of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.600
 internal memory with possible extension 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.690
 up to 32 gigabytes more via microsd 5 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 megapixels on the back with a flash 2 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.540
 megapixels in the front a battery of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.860
 4000 60 million father makes it 7.3 mm 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.410
 thick is very fine apparently 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.080
 it's one of the finest in 8 inches and 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.690
 it weighs only 310 g so it's true 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 how light is it that weighs a little 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.980
 but then I realize that was going 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.810
 very light then excuse me in advance 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.220
 and a black tablet we have to light it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.720
 a little not a little strange 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.310
 So it's going to be very complicated 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.490
 show you how you can see 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.700
 the details on this tablet but in 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.770
 wholesale wholesale we have different 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.660
 sensors and the output and the part which the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.190
 the front camera we have an audio output 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.570
 in my opinion if we can make calls 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.390
 it's just an audio output but I do not 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.770
 see you do not see me I see so much 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 nothing you too little on the top 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.550
 not and we see nothing but make me 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.530
 trust so that's what it's for 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.010
 the asim a priori unless it is for 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.240
 the micro sd i'm going to look at the side 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.290
 or maybe both I have the impression 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.480
 that it's both and a little icon 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.400
 which indicate the two good I think 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.020
 infrared port for use as 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.020
 that remote control and the jack 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.079
 lock unlock micro volume 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.180
 usb at the back so at this part 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.920
 there on the top that is very very 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.290
 classic tablets especially the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.659
 first tablets htc but it's also 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.159
 because it's in aluminum and suddenly 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.470
 it takes a plastic zone so there we 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.530
 to the camera and the camera hawk is 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 finally and the one-handed flash is a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.760
 little tense to use it's not necessarily 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.109
 the goal but suddenly we'll go 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.389
 quickly to the interface it will go 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:43.650
 quickly it's a tablet up that turns 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.750
 what version of android is this 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:51.959
 something that I was wondering because 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.919
 but not in 4/4 4.4.2 despite ben 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.510
 you see in the interface 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.430
 the use of these keys there is a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.169
 little like huawei who chose to 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.669
 doctors but it's purely aesthetic 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.909
 so otherwise at the interface level we 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:08.909
 of course you've seen an interface 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.650
 related to tablet sides so modes 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.069
 columns so I do not know if we have it here 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.510
 in the messages by my name but we 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.440
 had it in the settings so to my 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.440
 notice it is also elsewhere but but we 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.810
 can make calls that's it 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.220
 what does it interest me is what these voices 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.319
 this is a mode like that that allows 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.900
 to have small applications under 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.579
 pop-up form of windows that's it 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.280
 something quite conventional about 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.780
 on tablets a little less about 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.879
 smartphones but but we find it 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.459
 again we can change the size to 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.760
 priori that's what it's interesting 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.440
 we have a tooth we have a lot 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.449
 Applications almost all born 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.720
 there the whole collection of applications 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.639
 we have on the device I have the impression 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.609
 the keyboard looks like what that is 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.829
 I also wonder then that's it 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.720
 swiftkey this something that I like 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.459
 the question is is it the one 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.129
 by default there is where sp that is 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.379
 up there then have to buy that 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.879
 it gives when we buy it what 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.720
 that we have in terms of 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.910
 availability 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.870
 c 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.930
 October and at the price level we did not 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.700
 we do not have it I do not want to commit to it 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.530
 on it I heard that I heard a 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.570
 demo guy tell me 600 euros but I 'm there 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.700
 think I really had 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.530
 no i do not really believe it yeah for the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.600
 say sorry for disposing October 10 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.250
 it is rather September end of September 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.950
 here but someone else told me 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.420
 October so short is a bit complicated 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.320
 what else do we have here the 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.810
 Web browser 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.160
 the camera the camera directly 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.890
 of course integrated even though it's a 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.510
 tablet we can take pictures with 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.950
 here is something that is nice enough 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.810
 if you double tap and you can 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.130
 zoom out zoom out a finger I can also 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.390
 do it two fingers it's you who 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.040
 see could film of course chrome 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.840
 a lot of preinstalled applications 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.890
 still the gallery looks like what 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.290
 I think it's yeah that's the 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.430
 standard gallery it works well 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.840
 exactly where I say that it's a bit 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.890
 jerky but no it's wow 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:19.360
 ok I still think no it's 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.360
 enough it's pretty responsive music 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.210
 ok bah sees that's the same thing 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.740
 than on the on the hero 2 so we have a 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.560
 nice interface anyway for reader 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.210
 musical can take notes 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.180
 here with this application note that 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.930
 knows a priori it's something 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.580
 when we already had before I look 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.110
 just in productivity or is there right there 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.100
 there were pre- installed folders here 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.940
 just about everything I could in 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.260
 show cros dj and to this tablet 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.340
 version was compatible with the 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.070
 different accessories that can be 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.170
 find on the hero 2 apart from the 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.880
 protection of hero 2 1 but there we 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.950
 do not buy one has dj apps 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.090
 preinstalled I will not linger there 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.170
 on it's pretty much everything I 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.000
 can you say today on this 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.800
 tablet hero 2 08 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.410
 it was not a priori because we 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.020
 is not it too many tablets but 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.890
 that was it for my preview say 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.060
 me what do you think about them in 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.260
 comments what she is packing you 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.680
 I think the form factor is 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.850
 nice she is thin light in aluminum 8 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.350
 inches is a good format for a 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.240
 tablet is a bit like an ipad 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.530
 mini here so do not hesitate to tell me 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.710
 what you think about it but I do you 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.710
 see you soon
