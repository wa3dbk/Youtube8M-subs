00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.670 
they wouldn't put this in here for no
reason<00:01:44.070> also<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.240> planet<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:45.869> object<00:01:46.560> behind

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
reason also the planet or object behind

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.740 
reason also the planet or object behind
it<00:01:47.040> looks<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.909> miniature<00:01:48.329> Sun

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it looks kind of like a miniature Sun

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
it looks kind of like a miniature Sun
I'm<00:01:48.990> thinking<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> could<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.189> mercury<00:01:50.790> maybe

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
I'm thinking it could be mercury maybe

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.480 
I'm thinking it could be mercury maybe
um<00:01:51.420> we've<00:01:52.110> seen<00:01:52.350> pictures<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> mercury<00:01:53.159> before

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
um we've seen pictures of mercury before

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
um we've seen pictures of mercury before
in<00:01:53.640> concept<00:01:54.420> art<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.869> has<00:01:55.680> always<00:01:55.860> been<00:01:56.130> like

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
in concept art and has always been like

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.429 
in concept art and has always been like
bright<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.000> glowing<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
bright and glowing so it could be that I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.760 
bright and glowing so it could be that I
do<00:01:58.799> know<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.820> some<00:02:00.270> leaked<00:02:00.630> files<00:02:01.350> and
