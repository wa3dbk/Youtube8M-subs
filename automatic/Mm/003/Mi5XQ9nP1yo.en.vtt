00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
let's put in a physically based lighting

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.799 
let's put in a physically based lighting
system<00:00:44.470> and<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:45.250> global<00:00:45.580> illumination<00:00:45.820> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.300 
when speaking of the Final Fantasy games
they<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.260> lot<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.440> people<00:02:28.860> might<00:02:29.070> think

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
they I think a lot of people might think

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.910 
they I think a lot of people might think
of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.060> effect<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.900> meet<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.170> new<00:02:31.440> system

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
of the effect like meet the new system

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.430 
of the effect like meet the new system
we<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.970> generate<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.020> lot<00:02:34.200> more

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
we can generate like a lot more

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.650 
we can generate like a lot more
particles<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.100> tons<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.610> particle<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.300> we

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
particles with tons of particle and we

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110 
particles with tons of particle and we
can<00:02:36.840> let<00:02:36.990> them<00:02:37.230> move<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.040> interact<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
can let them move and interact with the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.590 
can let them move and interact with the
environment<00:02:39.810> by<00:02:40.320> their<00:02:40.530> aunt<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:42.240> one<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
environment by their aunt so one of the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.810

big<00:02:42.750> focuses<00:02:43.260> her<00:02:43.410> Final<00:02:43.740> Fantasy<00:02:44.100> 15<00:02:44.250> is

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
big focuses her Final Fantasy 15 is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.310 
big focuses her Final Fantasy 15 is
really<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.180> ground<00:02:45.450> our<00:02:45.630> animations<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
really to ground our animations the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.980 
really to ground our animations the

as possible our goal is to remove any of
the<00:02:51.000> disconnects<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.750> character<00:02:52.170> motions<00:02:52.560> in
