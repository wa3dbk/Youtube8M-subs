00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
tutorial and only things we have left to

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.340 
tutorial and only things we have left to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
do is pretty much change the blue view

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.200 
do is pretty much change the blue view
so<00:00:07.649> it's<00:00:07.830> pretty<00:00:08.189> much<00:00:08.370> work<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
so it's pretty much work with the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.480 
so it's pretty much work with the
interface<00:00:09.630> files<00:00:09.900> adding<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.010> colored

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
interface files adding the colored

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.079 
interface files adding the colored
backgrounds<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.630> go<00:00:12.840> ahead<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.080> click<00:00:13.410> blue

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
backgrounds so go ahead and click blue

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.510 
backgrounds so go ahead and click blue
window<00:00:15.089> excuse<00:00:15.660> me<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.990> XIB<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.310> of

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
window excuse me that XIB and this is of

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.160 
window excuse me that XIB and this is of
course<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> open<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.570> interface

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
course going to open up interface

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250 
course going to open up interface
builder<00:00:19.789> pretty<00:00:20.789> cool<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.600> now<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:22.109> we

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
builder pretty cool so now what we

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.980 
builder pretty cool so now what we
wanted<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.820> file's<00:00:24.150> owner<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
wanted to do is this file's owner it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.929 
wanted to do is this file's owner it
doesn't<00:00:25.410> exactly<00:00:25.680> know<00:00:26.099> which<00:00:26.550> class<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
doesn't exactly know which class is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.970 
doesn't exactly know which class is
supposed<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.539> changing<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.019> view<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.830> go

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
identity under class you see the default

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
identity under class you see the default
is<00:00:33.960> nsobject<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:35.250> want<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> say<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:36.000> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
and begin working with the interface

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020 
and begin working with the interface
itself<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.110> ahead<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.320> click<00:00:49.590> view<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> in

itself so go ahead and click view and in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
itself so go ahead and click view and in
the<00:00:51.210> attributes<00:00:51.780> right<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.710> ahead<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the attributes right here go ahead and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.189 
the attributes right here go ahead and
change<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> background<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.149> nice<00:00:54.480> blue

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199

view<00:00:55.500> looks<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.940> change<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
view looks pretty good I change it to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.389 
view looks pretty good I change it to
this<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.559> lighter<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.370> that

this that's a little lighter I like that
one<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.820> better<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> make<00:01:01.559> sure<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
one a little better so make sure you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.170 
one a little better so make sure you
change<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> light<00:01:02.460> blue<00:01:02.699> or<00:01:02.879> else<00:01:03.030> your

change to the light blue or else your

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.350 
change to the light blue or else your
program<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> blow<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
program is going to blow out now in your

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.399 
program is going to blow out now in your
attributes<00:01:06.960> inspector<00:01:07.909> right<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:10.200> see

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
attributes inspector right here you see

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.679 
attributes inspector right here you see
simulated<00:01:11.159> interface<00:01:11.700> elements<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.360> this

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
simulated interface elements and this

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.830 
simulated interface elements and this
can<00:01:12.930> simulate<00:01:14.060> interface<00:01:15.060> elements<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.720> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
can simulate interface elements if you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
can simulate interface elements if you
couldn't<00:01:16.110> tell<00:01:16.140> by<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> title<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.340> remember

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
couldn't tell by the title so remember

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
couldn't tell by the title so remember
in<00:01:18.390> our<00:01:18.540> program<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> bar<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
in our program we have that bar at the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.240 
in our program we have that bar at the
bottom<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> toolbar<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> order<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
bottom and it's a toolbar so in order to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
bottom and it's a toolbar so in order to
simulate<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.360> our<00:01:24.479> view<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:25.229> ahead<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
simulate this in our view go ahead and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.280 
simulate this in our view go ahead and
your<00:01:25.920> attributes<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.490> attributes<00:01:27.060> inspector

your attributes and attributes inspector

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.050 
your attributes and attributes inspector
simulate<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> elements<00:01:28.799> bottom<00:01:29.310> bar<00:01:29.549> go

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
simulate the elements bottom bar go

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420 
simulate the elements bottom bar go
ahead<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> select<00:01:30.630> tool<00:01:31.259> bar<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:32.100> look<00:01:32.310> what

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
ahead and select tool bar now look what

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.830 
ahead and select tool bar now look what
happens<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.820> our<00:01:32.939> view<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.570> blank

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
happens in our view this little blank

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
happens in our view this little blank
toolbar<00:01:34.409> pops<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.430> simulates<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
toolbar pops up and it simulates a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 
toolbar pops up and it simulates a
toolbar<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> screen<00:01:37.590> pretty<00:01:38.340> cool<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
toolbar on the screen pretty cool so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
toolbar on the screen pretty cool so
this<00:01:38.909> actually<00:01:39.090> isn't<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> show<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.710> on

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
this actually isn't going to show up on

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
this actually isn't going to show up on
our<00:01:40.890> view<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> simulate<00:01:41.909> what

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
our view is just going to simulate what

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.870 
our view is just going to simulate what
a<00:01:42.329> toolbar<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.159> mean<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.610> kind

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
a toolbar would be so I mean that's kind

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.170 
a toolbar would be so I mean that's kind
of<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.240> want<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> only<00:01:46.860> thing<00:01:47.180> we

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of what we want so the only thing we

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
now why did I do that so this class

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.180 
now why did I do that so this class
needs<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.610> able<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.940> access<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
needs to be able to access the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.490 
needs to be able to access the
that<00:02:13.280> view<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.570> didn't<00:02:14.930> set<00:02:15.110> everything

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
that view and we didn't set everything

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.230 
that view and we didn't set everything
up<00:02:15.590> by<00:02:15.710> default<00:02:16.160> remember<00:02:16.580> we<00:02:16.700> made<00:02:16.850> all<00:02:17.090> our

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
up by default remember we made all our

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.960 
up by default remember we made all our
classes<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:19.280> how<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.490> get<00:02:19.730> this

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
classes so that is how you get this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.470 
classes so that is how you get this
class<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:21.380> be<00:02:21.500> able<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.950> access<00:02:22.430> its<00:02:23.090> view<00:02:23.450> I

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
class to be able to access its view I

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.940 
class to be able to access its view I
know<00:02:23.630> it's<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.960> weird<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.800> do

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950
