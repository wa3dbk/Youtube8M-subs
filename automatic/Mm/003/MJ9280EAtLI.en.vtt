00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.989
 a man then questioned the disease 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.009
 because he did not do his best to fulfill the last will of blood 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.659
 because she was silent 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.659
 nurse looked at the man with eyes full of sadness 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:01.329
 and he told them 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.979
 for a reason 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.379
 because the people in the other car 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.839
 They were his dad and his mom 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.359
