00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 ah 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.370
 hello how about good friends then in this 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.370
 video tutorial is to do and how can 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.970
 restore or remove passwords from a 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.710
 administrator user in windows 7 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.760
 Well, to begin with we have to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.330
 have our windows 7 cd or if yes 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.440
 they do not have the cd they can download the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:11.630
 image made of windows 7 and that logo you 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:16.460
 speak on a usb or on a good cd 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.520
 I'll leave the download link for the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.310
 image made of windows 7 and apart from them 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:28.140
 I will leave a video to do it to be 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:32.430
 drinking this is good 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.800
 this to begin with because I have 222 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.260
 posts that is not mine and another post 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.280
 it's an example 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:44.080
 here as you see, I put my password and I do not 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.550
 it starts me so we will do the following 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.470
 we put our site 7 the usb and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.470
 we restart the system 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.520
 I hope more here at the beginning 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.720
 good here is downloading the files 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.680
 well when it came out when I hit 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.830
 the disk is to say windows 7 that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.459
 Well, there he selects my language and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.650
 then I told him to install now and good 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.040
