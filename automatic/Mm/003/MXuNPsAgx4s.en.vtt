00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.220
 good morning to all, so today it is me 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.110
 a package has arrived that actually does not 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.450
 it has nothing to do with my channel because 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.980
 these are things that have nothing to do with it 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.410
 anything 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.900
 then they put us to send one less 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.400
 week and in the sense that I did 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.110
 the order a week ago to me have it 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.640
 sent yesterday but today has arrived and 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.670
 since they shipped from france 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.290
 in the face of speed 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.090
 then it is a very heavy package weighs six 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.770
 pounds of I do not know how it is possible that 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.960
 weighs so much since there is no longer either 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.460
 that there is so much stuff anyway 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.020
 as you could see from the title 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 picture 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:55.280
 the package counts in American foods then 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.830
 there is this site which is called here it is 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.130
 in american market the site is never 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.320
 american market point com and has it 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.299
 made to discover a friend of mine and I have not 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.030
 could resist the temptation of 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.090
 find these strange things the ces except 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.920
 in the sense I often see them in cartoons 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.830
 animated like the simpsons or in the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.420
 But American TV series are things that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.159
 here they are not found and therefore now 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.670
 I want to try them 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.399
 we see a little pull out then these 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.810
 and this is sugar and cotton candy 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.219
 I did n't buy it, they gave it as a present 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.420
 therefore less given the snails 3 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:39.890
 cotton candy then oh my god this 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.979
 then I saw this also in 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.929
 some videos of Italian girls who 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.770
 a video in which book they tried precisely 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.719
 this is a jar of marshmallow in 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.609
 cream like me don't make you crazy 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.889
 marshmallows because they have the consistency 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.259
 strange it almost seems to eat bread 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:58.880
 but this styrene is a cream 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.159
 precisely it will have the same taste but is the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.179
 cream therefore inspires me a lot and not 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.740
 I look forward to tasting it then if buzzi 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.360
 you are interested i can try to do 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.660
 some taste videos like those that 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.810
 the oriental snacks then help it 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.459
 box too far then or mine 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.190
 god caught a lot 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:24.240
 then these are the op art 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.700
 then these are the cookies we say 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 stuffed giants with the above on top 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.040
 a glaze 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.070
 there are obviously so many flavors 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.510
 these are the small is more are 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.940
 these in the picture are cookies 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
 with loose marshmallows and chocolate 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.850
 even those are very common in 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.940
 America and I never tasted it 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.270
 however these should be warmed up in the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.130
 microwave but it doesn't even work that way 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.720
 also because I don't have a microwave 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.130
 and then anyway he told me that it is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.110
 indeed it is so it can heat up even in the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.120
 toaster then wanting the scandals to the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.090
 our bread and they inspire me a lot 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.830
 I bought both smooth and non 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.800
 here I come to the red velvet that 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.770
 it would taste like cupcake a lot 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.320
 famous then actually chocolate and 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.040
 red oh my God I can't wait to try it 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:18.770
 these things what or my god 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.630
 that's why he loaned so much is ok 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.450
 very heavy are cans to the face 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.489
 some cans such as coca cola 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.050
 the family then it is likely that the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.410
 they suck and then see that they are 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.360
 been done I do not know what I will do with it 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.640
 but god with the vanilla that is folded 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.110
 sorry oh I can't wait to try 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.970
 also this 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.590
 now it has been discovered why the package weighed 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.000
 so much these Latinas take one 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:52.530
 avalanche then yes I wanted to taste 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.230
 this green apple soda 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.209
 I really like the know of the green apple 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:04.290

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.230

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:27.360
 then I wanted to taste a strange taste 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.539
 of pringles and these are potatoes 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.509
 cooked baker you can mean pope for 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.789
 so struggles are a bit special 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.319
 oh well there was no taste that inspires me 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.719
 are particularly so I took it 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.069

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.050

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.500
 seen by a girl who the hell was not 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.589

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.669

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:52.529

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.289
 yellow and chocolate and tir 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.819
 peanut butter and suu kyi views it 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.050
 even by more people, and therefore seen 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.879
 who all said they were good and 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.870
 alive let 's try the butter though 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.050
 peanut doesn't really make me crazy 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.550
 but let's try and then they have nothing 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.240
 thrown into a hull role 2 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.379
 random candies and nothing they don't see to 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.120
 try these things again apart from 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.419
 candies that god gave me the urge 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.860
 to try and nothing I recommend 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.750
 try this site if you are interested 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.460
 these things because they also have 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.939
 pretty good prices I have to say not 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.959
 nothing exaggerated and nothing we feel 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.959
