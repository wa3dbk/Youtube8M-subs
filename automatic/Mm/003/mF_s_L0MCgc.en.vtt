 with gonzalo as gonzalo catalÃ  bruno and 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.530
 now talking about something that has already 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.000
 become something more than an object of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.830
 luxury but already practically part of 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.019
 our life that are the tablets the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.910
 tablets are with everything now in the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.890
 local market and above all we have a 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.050
 great variety now of windows tablets 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.570
 in different shapes sizes brands 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.949
 prices and how interesting we are 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.310
 we want to make tablets not 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.769
 just be an object to play or watch 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.500
 videos or entertainment that is also 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.390
 very important but also to that we 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.130
 help our productive life how many 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.780
 Sometimes we are on the tablet we receive a 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.820
 file that suddenly we can not see it 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.410
 we can not edit it with windows 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.210
 tablets do not have the possibility for 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.620
 example of running office not running 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.640
 office in many of them already comes 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.980
 incorporated what you do not have to spend 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.690
 also additional versions for everything 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.280
 pocket let's show that some here 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.590
 this is an adaptable 8-inch 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.270
 because we in the super positive brand 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.440
 thin but also has 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.450
 expansion ports for your sbh of my 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.780
 hearing aids then by incorporating more 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.600
 space accessories also sd cards 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.180
 all applications comes with office 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.799
 also or we also have a convert 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.570
 a two in one that serves me as much as 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.460
 laptop to do all the work that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.020
 want but it's also a tablet in 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.790
 this case a tablet of a screen 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.440
 quite big then you can work 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.390
 the desktop and when you get bored the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.520
 get out and lose yourself in the armchair 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.899
 and you're seeing what you want this is 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.350
 quite interesting because it's a 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.020
 tablet that has a very light format 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.200
 very interesting but it's a local brand 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.660
 is advanced and we are also betting 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.149
 for the development of suppliers 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.009

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.409

 some cases according to the model 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.039
 also the possibility of having this 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.110
 broadband through telephony not 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.850
 only the two-in-one version and this 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.619

 the features mentioned before the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.110
