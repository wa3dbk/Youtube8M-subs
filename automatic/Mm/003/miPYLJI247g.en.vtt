00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.410
 Ooh pressure 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:40.700
 Dear Laila 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.950
 Dear Joey 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 I'm from the first year of teaching, Hula, baby 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.960
 Do you remember when Dad said that the first 6 months of trying anything is harder 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.600
 That was true, and everything would be fine 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.970
 Things may seem difficult at the moment, and at times you want to give up. 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.329
 But do not do that please. Just know you will be a great teacher. 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.839
 You may wonder why you decided to enter this area. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.869
 Just take a deep breath. I know that your feelings are overwhelming 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.270
 And terrified, but you will succeed 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.479
 These kids before you want to learn 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.560
 Try something crazy you think about 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.899
 In the end these are the things they will remember. Your students need you. 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.810
 At the front of the class they appreciate what they do for them 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 Even if they did not show up at all times. You will have problems the first day of school 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.590
 When some students throw the book at you. 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.319
 The book will not catch you but do not worry, this student will be back after 5 years 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.960
 He introduces you to his new family and will share 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.270
 Because you were next to him all the time even after throwing it to the book 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.920
 When students say that your share is boring 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.970
 Do not take it personally this thing happens to all teachers 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.009
 Making your disciples bear responsibility for their actions is the greatest love you offer them. 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.220
 Teaching is not a science 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.660
 It is normal to suffer in order to get answers. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.440
 This is one of the greatest lessons you learn as a teacher 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 You will fail and make mistakes that will embarrass yourself 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.599
 When you do these things you accept them humbly. Do not be afraid to ask for help 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.819
 You will also learn that you will not stop learning the things that make you the teacher that you want to be in on your first day 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.440
 The things that you expected it to get on your first day will not happen 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.800
 After 3 or 4 or even after 18 years of teaching 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.099
 People's lives and their future depend on you 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.129
 This is scary and exciting. You will know that this is where you should be 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.110
 No matter what you think 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.850
 You are doing a good job 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.560
 Through all that good and bad just trust yourself and everything will be fine 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.050
 After 7 years I have been very fond of coming to work every day 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.530
 Keep up your work and ask for help from those around you 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.980
 I only know that the work of the teacher is the most important and the greatest 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.200
 Signature: You are from the future
