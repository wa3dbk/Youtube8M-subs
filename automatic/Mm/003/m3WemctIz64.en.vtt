00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.770
 with the new sports league player 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.439
 and start winning from the heart 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.730
 of the swollen people tell us how 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.730
 your passion for soccer began 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:40.880
 Small likes a lot of mystery football 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.300
 they played, I played, and that 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.829
 I was passionate about that 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.809
 and thanking God that He has 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.720
 liked what is the first memory that 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.340
 you have football I remember myself 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.260
 first shoe 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.510
 what a gift 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.680
 and is a godmother 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.379
 I was about 15 years old and I think it was a 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.479
 emotion very calculated as they were the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.119
 Mark all the goals you did with 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.119
 those were the coats 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.080
 we hope not to go out to a new black with 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.550
 white of those were my minutes do not you 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.230
 you realized that he could be a soccer player 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:29.360
 in the conditions that 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:32.470
 that I had always prevailed in the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.470
 school was always 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:40.550
 selected best is that he gave me the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 opportunity to prove myself in a 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.720
 octubrino degree was a friend of my dad 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.790
 They took me to a test and I told you 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.900
 the client said you can become 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.410
 a footballer has these qualities 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.960
 the support of my uncles I think they 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.890
 they always had that confidence 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.320
 since I could 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.320
 in the technical game 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:22.569
 we teach you something professional was the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.150
 start aranda a Paraguayan taught me 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.129
 many things about what football is and 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.459
 Above all, humility and respect 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.750
 that one should have towards the club what is 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.720
 the goal that more shouted 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.410
 my goal that more irritated was the one that is 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.360
 what should you 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.110
 the sporting basin before goiás 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.420
 that was the most remembered and in which 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.490
 It messed up how you remember how it was 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.040
 surely what to then say how 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.440
 It was your vols and it was going running 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.420
 the repechage of the Copa Libertadores 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.830
 and we're losing 1 to 0 and at minute 74 and 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.870
 something 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.870
 and an overflow on the right and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.530
 it was a store center outside 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.800
 chest 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.280
 He took out an earwig and scored the goal and as 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.280
 the beasts 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.580
 I did not even know how to face the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.520
 emotion 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.660
 again 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.720
 was 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.480
 an immense joy that one does not know well 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.270
 what to do in the dreamed debut here and 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.820
 thank god I think those moments 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.760
 can mark my career because the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.590
 effort and sacrifice are always 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.160
 noble for it to be where I am now 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.940
 and from some cabal and before leaving to the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.880
 court I do not have any cabal 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.960
 always that yes thank God to me 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.240
 wife my parents because they are my 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.170
 backing and in my guide and your nicknames 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.819
 tricks 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.260
 It always kills me is in cicada 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.379
 ball 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.120
 that we do not support that and why 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.120
 cicada then left 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.380
 fabián gallardo who put me hustler 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.380
 for the speed for him 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.950
 with stretching that you always have 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.750
 within the field of play at the moment 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.669
 of going to press a ball like you 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.980
 could you describe as a player what 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.020
 are your virtues on the court 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.700
 I do not think the virtues in the one 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:51.090
 against one one it is very difficult to mark it and 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.850
 when they give you space 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.980
 and be able to kick from the outside that is the best 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.200
 that I 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.940
 and out of football like it's a day like 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.500
 yours now here I am here in Quito and 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.330

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:14.010
 training came to came home and from 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.230
 14 one has to rest to be 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.980
 resting and after watching television 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.920
 since I still do not know anything about 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.960

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.690
 in rest and what friends have you done and 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.600

 they are many known the sun is many 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.990
 friends I think always respect that 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.340
 one has inside the playing field and 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.560
 outside the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.630
 I think a nice family is formed here 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.430

 news that he was the league player 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.110
 I think the call 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.170
 in the businessman of the coaching staff 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.310

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.600
