going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.400> hold<00:00:26.670> deep<00:00:27.060> they're<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.720> go

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
going to hold deep they're going to go

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
going to hold deep they're going to go
deep<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> they're<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.580> kind<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
deep and they're going to be kind of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.370 
deep and they're going to be kind of
inactive<00:00:30.750> at<00:00:31.590> those<00:00:32.099> times<00:00:32.610> well<00:00:33.380> artificial

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
inactive at those times well artificial

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.620 
inactive at those times well artificial
baits<00:00:34.649> probably<00:00:35.280> aren't<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.640> best<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.329> I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
baits probably aren't the best to use I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
baits probably aren't the best to use I
think<00:00:36.989> I'd<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.530> better<00:00:38.040> success<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.910> live

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
think I'd have better success with live

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.650 
think I'd have better success with live
bait<00:00:39.649> now<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> trick<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.420> bait

have holes at either end to pass your
line<00:00:59.520> through<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.329> only<00:01:00.539> need<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> remember

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
line through you only need to remember

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.860 
line through you only need to remember
to<00:01:01.559> wrap<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.250> line<00:01:02.520> around<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.180> shaft<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to wrap your line around the shaft of it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.469 
to wrap your line around the shaft of it
one<00:01:04.379> time<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> stays<00:01:05.790> more<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.180> less

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
one time so that it stays more or less

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
one time so that it stays more or less
in<00:01:06.659> place<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> can

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in place but when you want to you can

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.700 
in place but when you want to you can
push<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.119> down<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.689> line<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.200> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
push it up or down the line in this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
push it up or down the line in this
diagram<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> whole<00:01:12.240> rig<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
diagram you can see the whole rig and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
diagram you can see the whole rig and
you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.350> how<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.890> stopper<00:01:14.549> will

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you can see how that little stopper will

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.210 
you can see how that little stopper will
prevent<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.600> float<00:01:15.869> from<00:01:16.140> slipping<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
prevent your float from slipping all the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
prevent your float from slipping all the
way<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.790> line<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.930> way<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.619> can

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
way up your line in this way you can

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.219 
way up your line in this way you can
adjust<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> stopper<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.060> thus<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.780> depth<00:01:22.020> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
adjust the stopper and thus the depth of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
adjust the stopper and thus the depth of
your<00:01:22.290> weighted<00:01:22.860> hook<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> bead

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
your weighted hook that's for the bead

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.870 
your weighted hook that's for the bead
well<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.229> simply<00:01:25.439> acts<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.040> cushion<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.549> float

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
well it simply acts to cushion the float

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.749 
well it simply acts to cushion the float
from<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.630> stopper<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.040> convinced

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
from the stopper and I'm not convinced

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.360 
from the stopper and I'm not convinced
you<00:01:29.850> even<00:01:30.180> need<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.730 

I<00:01:38.830> guess<00:01:39.850> using<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:41.120> fixed<00:01:41.930> bobber

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
I guess using a fixed bobber

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.400 
I guess using a fixed bobber
has<00:01:43.130> some<00:01:43.460> problems<00:01:44.240> involved<00:01:44.870> at<00:01:45.020> least<00:01:45.050> it

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
has some problems involved at least it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.890 
has some problems involved at least it
does<00:01:45.620> for<00:01:45.890> me<00:01:46.040> some<00:01:46.310> guys<00:01:46.550> here<00:01:46.880> right<00:01:47.450> here<00:01:47.720> on

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
does for me some guys here right here on

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.280 
does for me some guys here right here on
YouTube<00:01:48.350> are<00:01:48.590> experts<00:01:49.250> at<00:01:49.460> casting<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.290> fixed

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
YouTube are experts at casting a fixed

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.640 
YouTube are experts at casting a fixed
bobber<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.770> an<00:01:52.370> debate<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:54.050> me<00:01:54.230> there's

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
bobber and an debate but to me there's

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.220 
bobber and an debate but to me there's
two<00:01:54.920> centers<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.670> gravity<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.450> they<00:01:56.660> tend<00:01:57.140> to

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
two centers of gravity and they tend to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.990 
two centers of gravity and they tend to
want<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.680> orbit<00:01:58.130> each<00:01:58.250> other<00:01:58.460> when<00:01:58.820> you're

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
want to orbit each other when you're

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.510 
want to orbit each other when you're
throwing<00:01:59.390> out<00:01:59.690> your<00:02:00.020> your<00:02:00.560> bait<00:02:00.800> but<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.100> slip

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
throwing out your your bait but a slip

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.360 
throwing out your your bait but a slip
bobber<00:02:01.730> cures<00:02:02.390> all<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.380> allows<00:02:04.070> you

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
bobber cures all of that and allows you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.740 
bobber cures all of that and allows you
to<00:02:04.520> get<00:02:04.700> your<00:02:04.760> bait<00:02:05.180> real<00:02:05.480> deep<00:02:05.810> ah<00:02:10.720> here<00:02:11.720> we

okay well the way I had it laid out in
the<00:02:18.650> pictures<00:02:19.100> in<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.460> diagram<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:21.050> bobber

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the pictures in the diagram the bobber

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.690 
the pictures in the diagram the bobber
stopper<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.630> know<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.710> twirled<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.430> line

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
stopper you know we just twirled a line

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.170 
stopper you know we just twirled a line
around<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.810> creates<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:28.180> it's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
around it and that creates a it's

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.510 
around it and that creates a it's
difficult<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.900> move<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.470> what<00:02:31.370> will

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
difficult to move it and what will

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.030 
difficult to move it and what will
happen<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.360> bobber<00:02:33.050> will<00:02:33.320> float<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.710> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
happen is the bobber will float up and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.250 
happen is the bobber will float up and
then<00:02:34.250> stop<00:02:34.670> there<00:02:35.060> right<00:02:35.270> up<00:02:35.690> against<00:02:36.200> that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
then stop there right up against that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.170 
then stop there right up against that
bobber<00:02:36.620> stopper<00:02:37.220> but<00:02:37.370> we<00:02:37.490> can<00:02:37.700> move<00:02:37.820> it<00:02:38.060> with

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
bobber stopper but we can move it with

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.480 
bobber stopper but we can move it with
our<00:02:38.390> hands<00:02:38.870> right<00:02:39.350> now<00:02:39.380> it's<00:02:39.830> set<00:02:40.010> for<00:02:40.220> only<00:02:40.370> a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
our hands right now it's set for only a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.890 
our hands right now it's set for only a
few<00:02:40.820> inches<00:02:41.680> I'm<00:02:42.680> going<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.070> set<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.910> lot

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
few inches I'm going to set it for a lot

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.199 
few inches I'm going to set it for a lot
deeper<00:02:45.290> because<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.950> whole<00:02:46.190> idea<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.180> to

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
deeper because the whole idea here is to

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.460 
deeper because the whole idea here is to
use<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.350> fish<00:02:48.560> deep<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:50.050> not<00:02:51.050> have<00:02:51.290> any

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
use it to fish deep and not have any

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.590 
use it to fish deep and not have any
trouble<00:02:51.920> casting<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.540> let's<00:02:53.989> see<00:02:54.170> I'm<00:02:54.380> I'm<00:02:55.600> six

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
trouble casting so let's see I'm I'm six

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.510 
trouble casting so let's see I'm I'm six
feet<00:02:57.020> five<00:02:57.410> inches<00:02:58.510> all<00:02:59.510> right<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.520> lied

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
feet five inches all right I lied

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.130 
feet five inches all right I lied
reverse<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:03.530> any<00:03:04.220> rate<00:03:04.870> here's<00:03:05.870> where

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
reverse that at any rate here's where

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.410 
reverse that at any rate here's where
I'm<00:03:06.260> going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.560> put<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.860> bobber<00:03:07.130> say<00:03:07.850> about<00:03:08.150> oh

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
I'm going to put the bobber say about oh

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.090 
I'm going to put the bobber say about oh
five<00:03:08.870> feet<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:11.600> bobber<00:03:11.840> stopper<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.650> five

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
five feet the bobber stopper is five

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.630 
five feet the bobber stopper is five
feet<00:03:13.400> when<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> bobber<00:03:14.420> comes<00:03:14.900> up<00:03:15.140> boom<00:03:15.920> it'll

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
feet when the bobber comes up boom it'll

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.530 
feet when the bobber comes up boom it'll
stop<00:03:17.000> there<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.620> it'll<00:03:19.310> allow<00:03:19.610> us<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:20.120> fish

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
stop there so it'll allow us to fish

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.610 
stop there so it'll allow us to fish
really<00:03:21.470> really<00:03:22.250> deep<00:03:22.630> as<00:03:23.630> deep<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.320> want

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
really really deep as deep as we want

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.759 
really really deep as deep as we want
but<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.400> cool<00:03:25.640> thing<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:26.239> see<00:03:27.230> how<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.590> slides

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
but the cool thing you see how it slides

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.790 
but the cool thing you see how it slides
down<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.930> cool<00:03:29.930> thing<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:31.870> we<00:03:32.870> can<00:03:33.140> cast<00:03:33.440> this

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
down the cool thing is we can cast this

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.449 
down the cool thing is we can cast this
thing<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.190> mile<00:03:34.459> because<00:03:35.209> why<00:03:35.830> we<00:03:36.830> only<00:03:37.040> have

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
thing a mile because why we only have

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.290 
thing a mile because why we only have
one<00:03:37.790> center<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.690> gravity<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:40.760> don't<00:03:41.030> have

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
one center of gravity you don't have

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:49.729 
one center of gravity you don't have
this<00:03:41.570> thing<00:03:42.140> going<00:03:42.530> around<00:03:42.680> itself

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.860 

okay<00:03:50.739> just<00:03:51.069> as<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> proof<00:03:51.849> of<00:03:52.060> concept<00:03:52.359> let's

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
okay just as a proof of concept let's

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.259 
okay just as a proof of concept let's
get<00:03:53.109> in<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.439> boat<00:03:53.680> where<00:03:53.980> we<00:03:54.189> can<00:03:54.400> access<00:03:54.730> some

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
get in the boat where we can access some

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.839 
get in the boat where we can access some
really<00:03:55.659> deeper<00:03:56.170> water<00:03:56.499> where<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.639> will

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
really deeper water where this will

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.160 
really deeper water where this will
prove<00:03:58.480> itself

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
prove itself

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.050 
prove itself
I<00:03:59.290> hope<00:04:00.010> look<00:04:00.549> okay<00:04:01.450> well<00:04:01.629> we're<00:04:02.079> in<00:04:02.260> about

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
I hope look okay well we're in about

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.580 
I hope look okay well we're in about
seven<00:04:04.060> feet<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.510> water<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:04.989> I've<00:04:05.109> got<00:04:05.379> this

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
seven feet of water and I've got this

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.539 
seven feet of water and I've got this
set<00:04:05.829> for<00:04:06.069> about<00:04:06.159> five<00:04:06.519> feet<00:04:06.849> it's<00:04:07.359> deep<00:04:07.689> here

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
set for about five feet it's deep here

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.640 
set for about five feet it's deep here
relative<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:09.849> little<00:04:10.209> pond<00:04:11.079> now<00:04:11.409> that's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
relative to this little pond now that's

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.920 
relative to this little pond now that's
odd<00:04:11.859> it's<00:04:12.099> like<00:04:12.370> oh<00:04:12.639> it<00:04:13.030> was<00:04:13.269> laying<00:04:13.540> on<00:04:13.719> its

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
odd it's like oh it was laying on its

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.879 
odd it's like oh it was laying on its
side<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:15.730> should<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.329> should<00:04:16.930> go<00:04:17.109> more<00:04:17.769> or

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
side that should it should go more or

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.039 
side that should it should go more or
less<00:04:18.070> upright<00:04:18.579> there<00:04:18.849> it<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.120> now<00:04:19.660> I've<00:04:19.840> added

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
less upright there it is now I've added

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.290 
less upright there it is now I've added
a<00:04:20.349> little<00:04:20.560> bit<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.979> a<00:04:21.070> sinker<00:04:21.519> to<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:22.090> to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
a little bit of a sinker to it just to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.560 
a little bit of a sinker to it just to
help<00:04:22.449> it<00:04:22.720> down<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.020> little<00:04:23.440> pinch<00:04:24.009> sinker<00:04:24.570> split

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
help it down a little pinch sinker split

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:35.189 
help it down a little pinch sinker split
shot<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:33.330> simple<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.479> that<00:04:34.810> proof

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
shot and that's it simple is that proof

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.909 
shot and that's it simple is that proof
of<00:04:35.470> concept<00:04:36.419> yeah<00:04:37.419> we<00:04:37.720> were<00:04:37.900> down<00:04:38.229> about<00:04:38.440> five

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
of concept yeah we were down about five

00:04:38.919 --> 00:05:00.790 
of concept yeah we were down about five
feet<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.610> that's<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:40.060> pretty<00:04:40.270> good<00:04:40.360> bluegill

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.410 

let's<00:05:01.800> bring<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.280> back<00:05:02.460> toward<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.180> boat<00:05:03.390> a

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
let's bring it back toward the boat a

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.360 
let's bring it back toward the boat a
little<00:05:03.690> now<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.680> lure<00:05:05.040> is<00:05:05.250> falling<00:05:05.760> down<00:05:06.000> and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
little now the lure is falling down and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.990 
little now the lure is falling down and
it<00:05:08.370> should<00:05:08.760> be<00:05:09.030> about<00:05:09.210> there<00:05:10.790> already<00:05:11.790> we're

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
it should be about there already we're

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.920 
it should be about there already we're
