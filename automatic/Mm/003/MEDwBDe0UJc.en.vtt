00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
here in Tiburon rowdy talk to us a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.919 
here in Tiburon rowdy talk to us a
little<00:02:08.819> bit<00:02:09.090> about<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> importance<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
little bit about the importance of the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
little bit about the importance of the
conditions<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.800> three<00:02:11.069> different<00:02:11.580> types

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
conditions I think three different types

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.220 
conditions I think three different types
of<00:02:11.940> conditions<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.660> were<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:12.900> talking

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
of conditions that we were just talking

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.869 
of conditions that we were just talking
about<00:02:13.290> John<00:02:13.620> first<00:02:13.860> obviously<00:02:14.610> they<00:02:14.790> are

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
about John first obviously they are

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.699 
about John first obviously they are
temperature<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.360> mentioned<00:02:15.690> very<00:02:15.930> very<00:02:16.500> nice

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
temperature you mentioned very very nice

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.710 
temperature you mentioned very very nice
outside<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.640> water<00:02:17.879> temperature<00:02:18.269> shouldn't

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
outside the water temperature shouldn't

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.390 
outside the water temperature shouldn't
be<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.959> big<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.379> factor<00:02:19.620> only<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
be that big of a factor only because the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.100 
be that big of a factor only because the
race<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.730> only<00:02:20.879> about<00:02:21.000> 20<00:02:21.420> minutes<00:02:21.569> long<00:02:21.870> for

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
race is only about 20 minutes long for

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.509 
race is only about 20 minutes long for
the<00:02:22.170> very<00:02:22.319> best<00:02:22.500> swimmers<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.250> last

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
the very best swimmers the last

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.949 
the very best swimmers the last
condition<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> most<00:02:24.420> important<00:02:24.840> and

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
condition is the most important and

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.449 
condition is the most important and
that's<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.349> current<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.160> think<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
that's the current and I think the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.130 
that's the current and I think the
current<00:02:26.670> right<00:02:26.879> now<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.540> favor<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.989> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
current right now is in favor of the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.290 
current right now is in favor of the
swimmer<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.890> three<00:02:29.400> combined<00:02:29.760> we're

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
swimmer so all three combined we're

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.940 
swimmer so all three combined we're
going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.690> very<00:02:31.050> fast<00:02:31.350> rate<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:31.830> have

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
going to see a very fast rate we have

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.010 
going to see a very fast rate we have
seen<00:02:32.220> races<00:02:32.610> won<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.940> lost<00:02:32.970> by<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.420> decision

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
as to which attack to take it will be

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.890
