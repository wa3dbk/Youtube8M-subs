00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.380
 more industrial histories these no longer 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.030

 remember that you can follow me in 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.729
 social networks and once you have created 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.470
 this is going to look like this is not 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.630
 automatically we will have a 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.270
 opt in fine profile if not if not 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.189
 this appears we are going to edit profile and 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.380
 let's give here to the one that appears 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.179
 here to review let's save 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.520
 profile and ready let's put ourselves in a 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:51.150
 volunteer does not observe by in my case in 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.900
 May 97 we are going to get you connected 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.210
 and we are going to put him on fire 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.800
 it's very easy guys he went happy 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.000
 because hai until the triumph at the base 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.310
 for these versions I will be able to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.800
 install and I'll be happy not 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.130
 Playing 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.950
 and then I said oh wow and it came out now if 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.570
 the tutorials had done this because 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.620
 We're going to look like Lieutenant fights here 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.180
 the minecraft we are already going we are a little bit 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.800
 I say to myself you can see uncheck here main 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.590
 that a few and we will all give 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.770
 video adjustment options and it already appears and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.630
 and the and the opt in fine and now yes 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.250
 end and now yes to him and only tim fain 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.770
 as you can see it already appears on the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.340
 guys this appears from the balance of the 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.690
 camera appears a lot of things guys 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.760
 already as you can see here there have been 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.720
 quite what I'm seeing that has 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.830
 changed quite 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.440
 at a distance the animation already appears 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.060
 all the boys and then nothing guys 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.910
 this about visibility I think it's like 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.460
 the other and although before was the render the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.110
 realization was short and all this then 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.030
 I think that this is right now and the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.340
 minecraft music as I shit them to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.690
 half more relaxing music and that 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.670
 like but the guys think that up 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.700
 here the video already came out they triumph by 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.870
 end now and remember that they can 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.680
 support me many studies giving 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.180
 like that is what contributes a lot to the channel 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.950
 and put a boy in another video 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.690
 remember to follow me socially in my networks 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.730
 social who are here quietly and 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.730
 so many videos guys and see you later
