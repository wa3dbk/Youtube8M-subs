00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the fans control the temperature 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.359
 environment that can not exceed 23 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
 degrees 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.740
 the floor and the rubber bed are synonymous 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.139
 comfort 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.839
 the oscillating brush is another differential 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.430
 of cabin confinement 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.750
 for animals if 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.400
 they feed 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 a cow that is at peak production 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.920
 for example receives up to 12 kilograms of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.830
 concentrate per day 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.990
 animal welfare is a priority in this the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.600
 confinement that even has 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.540
 automated cleaning with animal comfort 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.840
 which it is providing in the forest with 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.270
 air conditioning rubber mats you 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640
 increased her productivity so 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.489
 cost actually decreased and so 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.780
 favors us the better generated profit 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.640
 and clarissa do paraná are betting on new 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 technologies in order to improve 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 animal performance and reduce the costs of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.850
 production 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 this voluntary milking system 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.960
 installed on a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.060
 municipality of castro is an example of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.659
 investments in computerization do not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.460
 make the difference in the end 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.920
 when I started to study the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.439
 which milking parlor system or 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.930
 confinement that I was going to use 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.360
 processes the company's opportunity 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 to bring the robotic milking system or 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.049
 hates volunteering so we did 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.390
 technical trips to europe in the countries 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.600
 the Netherlands and in Sweden and what people 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 was able to identify there that well-being 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280
 animal in this system the animal adapts 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.400
 very well and the animals get very 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 and another reason for this in this 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.399
 system 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.070
 can you indicate before 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.100
 anomaly in the production or health of 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.530
 ulbra to the robotized enem was implanted 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.079
 on the property eight months ago 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.360
 Since then, all milk production has been 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.360
 monitored and recorded through a 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 software this cow for example keeps 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 daily production of 45 liters of 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.240
 October to here she produced more 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.000
 where a liter of milk and all that 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.370
 is stored in the program that allows 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.640
 that the monarchic herdsman flock 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.720
 anywhere you need to be connected to the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.480
 Internet 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.239
 each milking session is recorded is 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.090
 milking information for each room 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.790
 if the text of the animal is question this in 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.730
 the quality of milk to the health of the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.630
 government and texts as a matter of 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.650
 electrical conductivity level of blood and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.410
 consumption of food when the animal 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.739
 consumed at each visit at the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.019
 then all these data 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.280
 use the owner he has this data 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.500
 In real time 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.300
 milk production on the property is 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.920
 4 thousand 390 liters per day an average of 36 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.580
 liters per animal 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.010
 before each cow produces 27 liters 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.110
 investment the farmer was two 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.290
 million and six hundred and sixty thousand 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.180
 real 19 thousand reais per animal 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.640
 according to the association of 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.010
 cattle of the Dutch breed this is the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.500
 first voluntary milking system 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.750
 installed in Brazil and if in milking 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.840
 mechanical the milk taken two or three 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.340
 times a day a robotic system 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.630
 work has no pre-hours 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.000
 established 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.560
 software actually manages the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.840
 herd performance 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.720
 with this the animal that has a chip with 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.150
 all the necessary information will go 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.120
 to the dem at different times 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.340
 the system works 24 hours 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.880
 You do not need to be us here 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.859
 get up so early you're not so far away 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.230
 late at home we have a 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.530
 quality of life how to say yes better 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.510
 Well this is another point. 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.000
 also interesting from the system then 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.709
 this I think the great benefit in 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.430
 milk quality 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.470
 the quality of animal welfare and good 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.519
 being of employees of persons 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.920
 involved right 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.350
 with technology in Castro's favor has been 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.200
 outstanding in milk production 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.620
 according to IBGE information the 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.440
 county paranaense produce 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.419
 the 10 million liters of milk per year 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.180
 good part of this milk produced in the 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.600
 region in the right destination goes to 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.180
 cooperative castrolânda that pays up to r $ 1 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.430
 and sixteen cents per liter of 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.300
 product that must follow the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.699
 established by normative instruction 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.139
 62 the quality of milk is taken a lot 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.360
 by the cooperative and the 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.010
 cooperative there is a system of 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.550
 payment for what is the volume and 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.979
 which is very challenging then the 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.990
 producer is required to make improvements in 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.880
 conditions of animal hygiene 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.639
 conditions for obtaining milk from 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.160
 better quality is seen that our 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.690
 milk in terms of quality 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.690
 in relation to Brazil
