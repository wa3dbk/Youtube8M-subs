00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
like to track it I just tried it just to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
like to track it I just tried it just to
see<00:01:25.979> how<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.250> work<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> what

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
see how it would work and this is what

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
see how it would work and this is what
the<00:01:27.960> app<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> logs

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the app will do for you take the logs

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.149 
the app will do for you take the logs
that<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.869> gear<00:01:31.409> fit<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
that you have on your gear fit and it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
that you have on your gear fit and it
will<00:01:32.280> basically<00:01:32.460> sync<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> sleep

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
will basically sync it with the sleep

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.980 
will basically sync it with the sleep
app<00:01:34.290> which<00:01:34.890> looks<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:35.850> much<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.150> an<00:01:36.780> s

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
app which looks very much like an s

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.740 
app which looks very much like an s
health<00:01:37.439> app<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.759> integrated<00:01:39.420> right

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
health app but it's not integrated right

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
health app but it's not integrated right
what<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
what you can do then do is go here to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.639 
what you can do then do is go here to
this<00:01:42.450> log<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.500> some

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
this log and you can get some

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
this log and you can get some
information<00:01:43.890> about<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.030> how<00:01:45.210> many

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
information about you know how many

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.960 
information about you know how many
hours<00:01:45.780> did<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.140> sleep<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:47.340> many<00:01:47.520> times<00:01:47.820> were

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
hours did you sleep how many times were

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.310 
hours did you sleep how many times were
you<00:01:48.030> turning<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.600> bed<00:01:48.780> were<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.049> moving

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you turning in bed were you moving

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
you turning in bed were you moving
around<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.770> saying<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.430> restless

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
around and saying that I was restless

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
around and saying that I was restless
20%<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.290> sleep<00:01:52.649> time<00:01:52.890> which<00:01:53.100> accounts

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
20% of the my sleep time which accounts

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.420 
20% of the my sleep time which accounts
then<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.720> how<00:01:54.990> well<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.350> slept<00:01:55.649> at

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
then for you know how well you slept at

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.480 
then for you know how well you slept at
the<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.360> monitoring<00:01:58.110> or<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.740> data<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.399> you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the the monitoring or the data that you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.770 
the the monitoring or the data that you
get<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.649> say<00:02:02.180> limited<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.509> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
get is very I would say limited or it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.319 
get is very I would say limited or it's
in<00:02:03.869> its<00:02:03.990> infancy<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.159> compare<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.880> what

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
in its infancy if I compare it to what

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.180 
in its infancy if I compare it to what
you<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.439> jawbone<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.560> Fitbit

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you get on the jawbone up or the Fitbit

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
you get on the jawbone up or the Fitbit
force<00:02:11.940> or<00:02:12.239> even<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.780> fifth

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
force or even the fifth

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.330 
force or even the fifth
but<00:02:14.260> again<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.530> depends<00:02:14.799> on<00:02:14.890> what<00:02:15.069> you<00:02:15.190> look

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
but again it depends on what you look

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.660 
but again it depends on what you look
for<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.989> sleep<00:02:17.230> monitoring<00:02:17.769> so<00:02:18.190> it's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
for in in the sleep monitoring so it's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.250 
for in in the sleep monitoring so it's
just<00:02:18.940> telling<00:02:19.090> me<00:02:19.299> once<00:02:19.480> again<00:02:19.599> how<00:02:20.200> many

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
just telling me once again how many

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.899 
just telling me once again how many
hours<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.680> slept<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.099> how<00:02:21.190> many<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.640> was

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
hours I slept and how many of that was

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.449 
hours I slept and how many of that was
I'm<00:02:22.060> moving<00:02:22.330> around<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.659> lot<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:24.010> think

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
I'm moving around a lot so I think

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.699 
I'm moving around a lot so I think
that's<00:02:24.790> pretty<00:02:25.030> good<00:02:25.299> but<00:02:25.900> again<00:02:26.019> I'm<00:02:26.200> not<00:02:26.230> one

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
that's pretty good but again I'm not one

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.320 
that's pretty good but again I'm not one
of<00:02:26.739> those<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.129> really<00:02:27.549> track<00:02:27.879> a<00:02:27.909> lot<00:02:28.090> about

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
of those that really track a lot about

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.300 
of those that really track a lot about
sleep<00:02:28.629> but<00:02:28.840> now<00:02:29.049> you<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.440> an<00:02:29.620> app<00:02:29.829> that<00:02:29.860> will

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
sleep but now you have an app that will

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.000 
sleep but now you have an app that will
show<00:02:30.579> you<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.239> know<00:02:31.329> your<00:02:31.810> sleep<00:02:32.319> monitor<00:02:32.829> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
show you you know your sleep monitor and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.280 
show you you know your sleep monitor and
here<00:02:33.640> it's<00:02:33.879> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.120> show<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.450> at<00:02:34.870> what

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
here it's going to show you at what

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.080 
here it's going to show you at what
points<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.340> night<00:02:36.370> where<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.879> actually

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
points of the night where you actually

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.149 
points of the night where you actually
rest<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.720> room<00:02:37.870> moving<00:02:38.049> around<00:02:38.349> so<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:38.950> shows

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
rest this room moving around so it shows

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.979 
rest this room moving around so it shows
you<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.610> my<00:02:39.790> case<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.209> was<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.720> know<00:02:40.810> moving

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
you in my case I was you know moving

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.600 
you in my case I was you know moving
around<00:02:41.170> at<00:02:41.319> 12:00<00:02:41.530> midnight<00:02:41.769> 1:00<00:02:42.220> o'clock<00:02:42.310> in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
around at 12:00 midnight 1:00 o'clock in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.069 
around at 12:00 midnight 1:00 o'clock in
the<00:02:42.640> morning<00:02:43.060> 3<00:02:43.569> o'clock<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.989> morning

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
the morning 3 o'clock in the morning

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.300 
the morning 3 o'clock in the morning
until<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.829> know<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:44.950> actually<00:02:45.250> got<00:02:45.940> up<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.310> this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
until you know I actually got up so this

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.400 
until you know I actually got up so this
is<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:49.629> s<00:02:49.890> sleep<00:02:50.890> app<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.750> part<00:02:53.200> of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
is the the s sleep app that is part of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.780 
is the the s sleep app that is part of
the<00:02:53.829> s<00:02:54.010> health<00:02:54.760> app<00:02:55.739> family<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.829> products<00:02:57.220> but

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
the s health app family of products but

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.119 
the s health app family of products but
it's<00:02:57.909> not<00:02:58.120> integrated<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.260> find<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.769> app

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
it's not integrated so to find that app

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.069 
it's not integrated so to find that app
once<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.549> install<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.090> you're<00:03:01.690> going<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.900> just

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
once you install it you're going to just

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.020 
once you install it you're going to just
scroll<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.829> you<00:03:02.890> see<00:03:03.250> how<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.400> have<00:03:03.519> s<00:03:03.790> out

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
scroll and you see how you have s out

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.309 
scroll and you see how you have s out
there<00:03:04.299> you're<00:03:04.450> going<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.629> continue<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.049> scroll

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
there you're going to continue to scroll

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.880 
there you're going to continue to scroll
and<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:05.950> going<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.129> be<00:03:06.250> separate<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.629> I

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
and it's going to be separate so I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.869 
and it's going to be separate so I
expect<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.040> they're<00:03:09.280> going<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.519> they're

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
expect that they're going to they're

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.369 
expect that they're going to they're
going<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:10.030> integrate<00:03:10.269> this<00:03:10.629> into<00:03:10.870> s<00:03:11.079> health

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
going to integrate this into s health

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.020 
going to integrate this into s health
but<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.859> where<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.129> would<00:03:12.190> find<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.549> so

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
but this is where you would find it so

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.849 
but this is where you would find it so
that<00:03:13.329> was<00:03:13.659> just<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.900> really<00:03:14.049> quick<00:03:14.230> overview<00:03:14.470> of

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
that was just a really quick overview of

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.599 
that was just a really quick overview of
