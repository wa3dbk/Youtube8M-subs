00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.310
 Hello 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.630
 Thank you for taking a look today 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.310
 We introduce today and product is this 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:23.840
 Let's get started How to make a food life book 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:29.300
 So this book is a collaboration of two people , Mr. Toyo and Mr. Cough . 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:34.670
 What Tteyuu raw food well with both hands-on theoretical 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:37.960
 What for those who I mean the first time Tsu let's what Tteyuu food in're who presented 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:44.559
 I think it is very useful 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.550
 It is a useful book for those who want to know more about how food is done to some extent 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.830
 I do not think 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 In the same report is what it means, but how is food in a word 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.510
 It means to eat raw, that is, it does not go through the fire 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.659
 Meal 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.740
 It is said that the enzyme dies at more than 48 degrees by passing through the fire . 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 That 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:15.470
 In order for us take advantage of the Tteyuu important enzyme food enzymes 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.290
 It becomes very important to the Tteyuu meal of Nanami 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.890
 Food also because it is very enzyme is plenty of sound by Te to a meal of raw 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:29.350
 That makes our body's metabolism go well 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.370
 And digestion is difficult because it is hard to be smooth body is very easy and body light 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.510
 Feel 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.860
 And even better physical condition 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.800
 Many things happen 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:45.460
 So if you are doing 100% raw food, the world is actually a lot 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:49.240
 Of course you will come to Japan, but we will get there 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:55.030
 I think that 100% still has some difficult aspects 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:57.550
 It Tteyuu going to become really it is the body is easier but by the fact that close to 100% 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.860
 It will be just 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.450
 Not even so and say whether Bailly them to raw food raw eating blindly 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.020
 Basically, the plant 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.479
 Hmm 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:15.989
 That is to say get a raw 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.280
 In the important point is one if there are five that are germinated when it receives those of the raw 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.880
 is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.390
 Sprout 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.350
 For example, if it is brown rice, it will be germinated 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.940
 So are the grains , and those of various women 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.340
 Manemane class called Sprout whether those things the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:38.530
 It seems that it will be one point to say that it will sprout when eating 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.530
 In is that it is fermented in the second 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.410
 It was very interesting in this thing to be fermented 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.180
 Wheat fermented drink 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.510
 There is what 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.159
 Though is Kaiserslautern wrote under the name Tteyuu Lisieux Perakku 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:02.240
 It shows how to make a drink that ferments the barley 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:07.190
 So this Rejuberac is a key point in this book 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:12.110
 The food and drink of the various food trails 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:16.880
 I'm buying it so I was very new to myself so I haven't made it yet 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:21.319
 However, the drink that ferments this lijuberac wheat 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.620
 This was also the actual originator existence of raw food 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.010
 Wie cloud 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.930
 One way rubber is a difficult name to say that a doctor 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.920
 The doctor 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.140
 It seems the actual recipe was drinking as a drink 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:42.850
 In the Tteyuu this Dr. Though I'll died in an accident at about the age of 84 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:45.120
 When I was about 50 years old, I started drinking this box . 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:51.450
 It was white hair now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:57.239
 It is a kind of drink that is said to have become black and very framed hair 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.950
 So if you have a chance, try this Lijuberac drink 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.319
 I would like to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:08.770
 I myself have thought that I might try to make stick this one 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:12.560
 It is in trouble smelly feeling But a little honesty How to make 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:18.260
 I feel it and is kana little one cat 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:22.010
 The third point is that the food is to make it finer with the mixer 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.900
 That and the fourth bite and the fifth 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.930
 And be careful to alignment eat 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.979
 It is to say ANYTHING selfishness is aligned to eat 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.310
 It 's not so good if you can eat anything 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.419
 How to eat combine well to it because I 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.419
 That sort of you have become important to 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:47.750
 Oh, this whole book is very easy to understand 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:49.280
 There aren't so many photos and so on, but the recipes are written in various ways, so in fact 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.720
 Let's try it 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.560
 It is not easy to understand if it is good for those who try low food 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.560
 I think 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.620
 then 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:08.780
 As for the recipe , that juice's ring and so on 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.210
 Such things also rides Toka how to make pattern recipe drop dressing salvation how Smoothie 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.840
 Of a clearly have 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:21.550
 I think you can see it 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.550
 After that it is detox fasting , and then Enema 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:28.390
 It is intestinal cleansing and it is wonderful 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.630
 Also about fasting 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:36.950
 As it is stated specifically 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:44.870
 It is easy to understand and I thought it was very good after 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:50.630
 There is something like the experiences of people who are actually enclosed by Japanese people and foreigners. 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:55.550
 So was listed Toka whether or not there is what kind of change if it in this way specifically raw food 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:58.620
 It is that kind of thing what kind of physical condition change comes happening 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.110
 It is easy to be able to imagine or understand 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.670
 It has become 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:09.130
 That 's why this raw food life book 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:14.470
 It is suitable for those who are going to start raw food and raw food is actually doing though 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:17.350

 There are also instructions on how to make rejuberac 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:27.680
 I felt it was very easy to understand 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.139
 In terms of sprouting after 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:36.639
 It is germinated or a tree Toka various grain become 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:39.569
 The process of Tteyuu This Mochotto honest hen smells Do not do it even though it is written 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:44.980
 I felt this, I guess this 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:49.770
 Well, if you can actually go and clear it, it will be more and more called tofu. 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:54.370

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.590

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:13.750
