before you start I've just got a bit of
lapping<00:00:26.519> film<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> I'm<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
lapping film here and I'm just going to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.400 
lapping film here and I'm just going to
touch<00:00:27.689> these<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:32.059> if<00:00:33.059> you're<00:00:33.660> removing<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:34.260> old

touch these up if you're removing an old

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.880 
touch these up if you're removing an old
bar<00:00:34.739> you'll<00:00:35.640> need<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.030> file<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.809> off<00:00:37.020> before

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
bar you'll need to file that off before

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.639 
bar you'll need to file that off before
you<00:00:38.010> start<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.430> flattening<00:00:38.790> process<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
you start the flattening process and

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.410 
you start the flattening process and
squaring<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> edge<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.309> that's<00:00:42.090> normally

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
squaring the edge and that's normally

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.819 
squaring the edge and that's normally
done<00:00:42.480> by<00:00:42.660> placing<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.820> scraper<00:00:44.820> blade<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
done by placing the scraper blade in a

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.729 
done by placing the scraper blade in a
vise<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:48.110> swiping<00:00:49.110> across<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
vise and just swiping across it with a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.569 
vise and just swiping across it with a
smooth<00:00:50.039> file<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> I'll<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.039> make<00:00:56.280> sure<00:00:56.430> we've

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
smooth file so I'll just make sure we've

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.979

got<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.730> nice<00:00:57.030> polish<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> surface<00:00:59.809> on<00:01:00.809> all

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
got a nice polish on that surface on all

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.170 
got a nice polish on that surface on all
three<00:01:01.289> sides

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.140 

happy<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.300> that<00:01:10.760> then<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
happy with that then we get to the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
happy with that then we get to the
burnisher<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.100> dab<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> paraffin

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
burnisher just a little dab of paraffin

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
like on there just to lubricate it and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
like on there just to lubricate it and
then<00:01:20.730> you<00:01:20.820> place<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.690> scraper<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.380> edge

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
then you place the scraper on the edge

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.030 
then you place the scraper on the edge
of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> bench<00:01:23.750> lean<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> burnisher<00:01:25.410> into<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
of the bench lean the burnisher into the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.790 
of the bench lean the burnisher into the
direction<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.210> cutting<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.810> can

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
direction that it's cutting and you can

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.820 
direction that it's cutting and you can
see<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.580> are<00:01:29.760> angled<00:01:30.120> at<00:01:30.270> 15<00:01:30.660> degrees<00:01:31.050> on

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
see these are angled at 15 degrees on

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.810 
see these are angled at 15 degrees on
either<00:01:32.070> side<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.870> your<00:01:33.870> only<00:01:34.020> feeling<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.820> 90

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
either side so your only feeling for 90

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.600 
either side so your only feeling for 90
degrees<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.630> correct<00:01:36.930> angle<00:01:37.610> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
degrees to get the correct angle and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.880 
degrees to get the correct angle and
we're<00:01:38.730> just<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> swipe<00:01:39.950> across<00:01:40.950> there

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
we're just going to swipe across there

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.890 
we're just going to swipe across there
you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.040> hear<00:01:44.160> why<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.430> called<00:01:44.610> ticketing

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.160 

that's<00:01:48.900> just<00:01:49.230> gently<00:01:49.890> producing<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:51.170> little

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that's just gently producing a little

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.100 
that's just gently producing a little
bit<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.550> edge<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.810> scraper

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
bit right on the edge of the scraper

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
bit right on the edge of the scraper
whip<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.220> same<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
whip it over and do the same on the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.260 
whip it over and do the same on the
other<00:01:56.670> side<00:01:57.060> while<00:01:57.330> we're<00:01:57.480> here<00:01:59.000> doing<00:02:00.000> both

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
other side while we're here doing both

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.150 
other side while we're here doing both
at<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.450> same<00:02:00.510> time<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.770> avoid<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
at the same time you avoid the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.840 
at the same time you avoid the
possibility<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.850> damaging<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> birds

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
possibility of damaging one of the birds

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.410 
possibility of damaging one of the birds
while<00:02:05.850> you're<00:02:06.000> creating<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.600> other<00:02:06.720> one<00:02:08.420> as

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
while you're creating the other one as

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.980 
while you're creating the other one as
you<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.600> see<00:02:09.980> it's<00:02:10.980> not<00:02:11.510> requiring<00:02:12.510> an<00:02:12.720> awful

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you can see it's not requiring an awful

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.490 
you can see it's not requiring an awful
lot<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.140> effort<00:02:13.730> I'm<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:15.120> gently<00:02:16.050> pressing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
lot of effort I'm just gently pressing

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.160 
lot of effort I'm just gently pressing
down<00:02:16.680> onto<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.420> now<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.660> turn<00:02:18.900> those

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
down onto there now we can turn those

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.670 
down onto there now we can turn those
burrs<00:02:19.650> over<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.550> create<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.720> rounded<00:02:22.110> hook<00:02:22.380> on

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
burrs over and create a rounded hook on

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.760 
burrs over and create a rounded hook on
each<00:02:23.220> side<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> scraper<00:02:24.620> simply<00:02:25.620> by

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
each side of the scraper simply by

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.040 
each side of the scraper simply by
placing<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.340> burnisher<00:02:26.820> again<00:02:27.540> holding<00:02:27.959> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
placing the burnisher again holding it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.590 
placing the burnisher again holding it
at<00:02:28.170> 90<00:02:28.470> degrees<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.820> we<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.120> make<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.300> clean

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
at 90 degrees and we just make a clean
