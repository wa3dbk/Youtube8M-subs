00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.400 

we've<00:00:18.270> done<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> lot<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.660> work<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.109> these

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we've done a lot of work on these

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.870 
we've done a lot of work on these
vehicles<00:00:19.590> over<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> year<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.220> make<00:00:20.460> them<00:00:20.670> fly

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
vehicles over the year to make them fly

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.700 
vehicles over the year to make them fly
to<00:00:21.240> show<00:00:21.449> off<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.840> idea<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.380> creating

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
to show off this idea of creating

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.640 
to show off this idea of creating
something<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.369> amazing<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.060> motion<00:00:24.650> one

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
something that's amazing in motion one

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.109 
something that's amazing in motion one
of<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> great<00:00:26.070> technical<00:00:26.490> challenges<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
of the great technical challenges of the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
of the great technical challenges of the
job<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.590> taking<00:00:28.590> technology<00:00:28.890> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
job was taking technology that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.330 
job was taking technology that
previously<00:00:29.820> only<00:00:30.000> really<00:00:30.269> worked<00:00:30.769> in<00:00:31.769> an

into real public places

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.160 
into real public places
it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> massive<00:00:36.270> thing<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.570> Lexus<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
it's a massive thing for Lexus and a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.520 
it's a massive thing for Lexus and a
huge<00:00:37.320> part<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.649> project<00:00:39.320> there<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.410> an

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
huge part of this project there was an

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
huge part of this project there was an
awful<00:00:40.829> lot<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.100> development<00:00:41.910> research<00:00:42.540> trial

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
awful lot of development research trial

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.350 
awful lot of development research trial
and<00:00:43.079> error<00:00:43.200> involved<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:44.030> trying<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.270> the

quadratus to fly in this very precise
way<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.539> interact<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.399> everyday

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
way and to interact with everyday

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 

once<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.000> had<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> ideas<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.900> mills<00:00:58.110> we

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
once we had the ideas for the mills we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.780 
once we had the ideas for the mills we
actually<00:00:58.620> had<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> make<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.130> happen<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
actually had to make them happen you

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.360 
actually had to make them happen you
know<00:00:59.880> coding<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.540> whether<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.470> be<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:02.130> our

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
know coding it up whether it be on our

know coding it up whether it be on our
end<00:01:02.580> with<00:01:02.790> math<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.030> algorithms<00:01:03.630> or<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> mill

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
end with math and algorithms or the mill

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.620 
end with math and algorithms or the mill
through<00:01:04.440> animation<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.700> finally<00:01:06.150> going

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
through animation and then finally going

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.030 
through animation and then finally going
to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> real<00:01:07.170> space<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.500> actually

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to the real space and actually

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.560 
to the real space and actually
implementing<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.790> moves<00:01:14.420> we're<00:01:15.420> using

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
implementing these moves we're using

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.900 
implementing these moves we're using

in real time and each of these cameras

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.490 
in real time and each of these cameras
emits<00:01:23.250> infrared<00:01:23.760> light<00:01:24.300> and<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.930> IR<00:01:25.320> light
