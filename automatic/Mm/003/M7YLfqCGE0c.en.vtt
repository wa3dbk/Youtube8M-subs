 stuffing ingredients because I say 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.020
 part because some of the ingredients 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.020
 of the filling are not cooked 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.490
 with olive oil as for example 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.030
 these are cute 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.790
 and planks I would say thick canes of 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.310
 carrots that are boiled but here yes 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.850

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.160
 a little bit of red pepper 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.960

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.050

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.230

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.090

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.680

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.320
 then on one side we will load the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.570
 filling the withdrawal that we just skipped 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.270

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.120

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.600

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.900
 general happens to me with the desire of age and 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.520

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.520

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.860
 sauteed with green onion or 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.550
 white onion and peppers and now 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.230

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.580
 as we had said thick carrots 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.580
 boiled or by AIDS in steam 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.490

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.370
 cheese that we have out there is barbarian 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.800

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.170
 that you are sharpening it is stacking or 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.170
 putting one in the fourth 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.660
 along the yacaré table and more 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.880

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.010
 soccer last night mister panista close no longer 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.180
 we comment nothing removes this message 'no 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.180
 the second message 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.489
 oh what 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.600
 circuits that say I was 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.600
 advance chest 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.780
 but good morning we talk about tomorrow 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.020
 we talk about vido we have to do 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.710
 Now look very simple since we had 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.870
 loaded on one side we close so on the other 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.660
 we give it as a form is now what 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.350
 we are going to hold with some chopsticks 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.390
 wood does not even need to be sewn 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.520
 no way 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.040
 you put some chopsticks so they go to 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.010
 hold and this in the first instance what 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.300
 let's send smoothly and simply 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:07.200
 directly roasted in the oven 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.440
 35-40 minutes of oven at 170 degrees not 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.290
 metal then we're going to take it out we're going to 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.910
 generate a crust with chimichurri 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.710
 delicious and a garnish that is 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.250
 barbarian are a kind of volcano of 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.040
 bacon and mashed so I recommend it 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.390
 highly so if you allow me 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.660
 we finish closing the meat if it is 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.110
 with this wood nail we send it 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.620
 I repeat 35 40 minutes baked at 170 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.330
 degrees and we come back in an instant no no 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.330
