wheel for five feet it was a great piece
we<00:00:43.410> thought<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.129> time<00:00:44.309> about

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
we thought about it at the time about

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.920 
we thought about it at the time about
incorporating<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.329> our<00:00:45.480> side<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> side

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
incorporating it with our side to side

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.540 
incorporating it with our side to side
emitter<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> different<00:00:47.250> design

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
with our big round baskets last year we

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.130 
with our big round baskets last year we
came<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.120> our<00:00:51.149> flat<00:00:51.510> basket<00:00:51.960> emitter

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
came out with our flat basket emitter

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
came out with our flat basket emitter

to to a lot less moving parts in doing
this<00:01:12.799> we<00:01:13.799> didn't<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> swing<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
this we didn't have the swing of the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
this we didn't have the swing of the
cloth<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.600> came<00:01:15.750> back<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.080> said

cloth in there so we came back and said
now<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.890> might<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.189> able<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> incorporate

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
now we might be able to incorporate

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.550 
now we might be able to incorporate
these<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.119> pieces<00:01:18.420> together<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.409> is

drop in on the cavero section a little
bit<00:01:42.869> further<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.649> we're<00:01:44.189> doing<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.369> with

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
bit further out so we're doing it with

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
bit further out so we're doing it with
no<00:01:44.579> air<00:01:44.729> cylinders<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:46.079> car<00:01:46.290> happens<00:01:46.560> to

jump and roll or get out of sync it's

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
jump and roll or get out of sync it's
not<00:01:48.540> gonna<00:01:48.689> stop<00:01:49.020> pushing<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.740> unit<00:01:50.100> it'll

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
not gonna stop pushing this unit it'll

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249

only<00:01:52.500> gravity<00:01:52.829> returned<00:01:54.409> again<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.770> neat

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
only gravity returned again the neat

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
only gravity returned again the neat
part<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> pendulum<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
part is if you have a pendulum and you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
part is if you have a pendulum and you
have<00:01:58.320> an<00:01:58.409> 804<00:01:58.950> minute<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.549> 802<00:01:59.880> bitter<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
have an 804 minute or an 802 bitter you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.780 
have an 804 minute or an 802 bitter you
can<00:02:00.840> combine<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.619> lot<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> parts<00:02:02.700> are

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
can combine them a lot of the parts are

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.100 
can combine them a lot of the parts are
the<00:02:02.880> same<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.750> drill<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> couple

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the same you have to drill a couple

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
the same you have to drill a couple
holes<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.649> remount<00:02:04.860> them<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> bearing<00:02:05.759> block

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.510 
holes and remount them a bearing block
but<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.990> actually<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:08.009> forwards<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
but you can actually go forwards and

wrap arounds something to get the car a
little<00:02:31.550> bit<00:02:31.670> cleaner<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.180> you're

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
little bit cleaner because you're

even<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.120> way<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.240> look<00:02:38.480> at<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.690> if<00:02:38.870> you're

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
even the way you look at it if you're

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.810 
even the way you look at it if you're
out<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.140> space<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.650> need<00:02:39.800> more<00:02:40.040> designing<00:02:40.790> a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
out of space you need more designing a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.120 
out of space you need more designing a
new<00:02:40.940> tunnel<00:02:41.150> or<00:02:41.390> modifying<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.960> old<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:42.800> a

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
new tunnel or modifying it old this is a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.460 
new tunnel or modifying it old this is a
great<00:02:43.520> piece<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.790> look<00:02:44.090> at<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.630> 807<00:02:45.140> pendulum

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470
