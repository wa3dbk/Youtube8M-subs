easily over 125 miles that's half a tank
there<00:01:20.209> that'll<00:01:20.539> do<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.959> bit<00:01:21.279> like<00:01:22.279> just

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209 
there that'll do this a bit like just

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:24.699 
there that'll do this a bit like just
under<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.539> four<00:01:23.749> week<00:01:23.899> or<00:01:24.139> maybe<00:01:24.319> before<00:01:24.469> we

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
under a four week or maybe before we

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.649 
under a four week or maybe before we
depend<00:01:25.100> on<00:01:25.189> how<00:01:25.429> I<00:01:25.459> ride<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.789> size<00:01:29.029> that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
depend on how I ride the the size that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.300 
depend on how I ride the the size that
was<00:01:29.810> one<00:01:30.109> reason<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.590> actually<00:01:30.829> drew<00:01:31.039> me<00:01:31.219> in

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
was one reason that actually drew me in

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.089 
was one reason that actually drew me in
instead<00:01:31.639> of<00:01:31.700> watered<00:01:32.389> me<00:01:32.509> off<00:01:32.659> because<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:33.200> live

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
instead of watered me off because I live

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.940 
instead of watered me off because I live
in<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.369> well<00:01:35.179> I'm<00:01:35.569> in<00:01:35.779> a<00:01:35.810> busy<00:01:36.170> towns<00:01:36.439> quite<00:01:36.920> a

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
in a well I'm in a busy towns quite a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.219 
in a well I'm in a busy towns quite a
lot<00:01:37.159> where<00:01:37.369> traffic<00:01:37.639> is<00:01:37.880> really<00:01:38.090> heavy<00:01:38.359> this

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
lot where traffic is really heavy this

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.080 
lot where traffic is really heavy this
is<00:01:39.349> brilliant<00:01:39.560> for<00:01:39.709> just<00:01:39.979> getting<00:01:40.880> through

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
is brilliant for just getting through

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.849 
is brilliant for just getting through
town<00:01:41.329> quick<00:01:41.630> going<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:42.200> between<00:01:42.469> all<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.679> cars

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
town quick going in between all the cars

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.589 
town quick going in between all the cars
and<00:01:43.069> filtering<00:01:43.759> stuff<00:01:44.090> like<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:46.299> looks<00:01:47.299> as

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
and filtering stuff like that looks as

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:48.010 
and filtering stuff like that looks as
well

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
well

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.569 
well
looks<00:01:48.439> there's<00:01:48.619> another<00:01:48.829> reason<00:01:49.099> I<00:01:49.310> got<00:01:49.429> it

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
looks there's another reason I got it

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.909 
looks there's another reason I got it
because<00:01:49.959> CBF<00:01:50.959> and<00:01:51.200> things<00:01:51.349> like<00:01:51.499> that<00:01:51.560> they

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:51.919 
because CBF and things like that they

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.760 
because CBF and things like that they
were<00:01:52.209> also<00:01:53.209> candidates<00:01:53.749> that<00:01:54.409> was<00:01:54.529> thinking

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
were also candidates that was thinking

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.830 
were also candidates that was thinking
about<00:01:54.859> as<00:01:55.069> well<00:01:55.249> but<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:55.999> is<00:01:56.060> just<00:01:56.419> a<00:01:56.569> much

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
about as well but this is just a much

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.159 
about as well but this is just a much
prettier

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.169 

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.080

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
sport bikes like the wise at F 1 2 5 and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.069 
sport bikes like the wise at F 1 2 5 and
the<00:02:02.719> rs125<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:04.270> don't<00:02:05.270> throw<00:02:05.419> up<00:02:05.509> my<00:02:05.630> ball

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079
