00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.660
 d 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:09.650
 the day that I left jose was born in truth 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.260
 I did not feel great joy because I wanted 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.890
 a male 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:19.650
 two days later he returned to look for my 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.480
 two women one looked pale and the other 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.670
 radiant and sleepy 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 in a few months I was captivated by the 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.160
 smile of maria jose 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.400
 that's when I started to love her with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 madness his face and his look does not 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.060
 I took a moment away from my 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.390
 thought 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.540
 One day Daddy told me when he turns 15 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.630
 years what will be my gift but my love if 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.110
 you're barely 10 years old, good daddy 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.910
 you always say that time flies by 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.900
 and it was true 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.670
 Maria Jose was already 14 years old and excellent 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.300
 school notes 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.980
 took up all the space at home in the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.980
 mind and in the heart of the family 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.280
 especially his father's 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.090
 it was a very early Sunday when we 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.899
 we headed to mass 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.009
 mariajo stumbled upon something we thought 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:25.010
 all and stumbled I stopped her from 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.980
 immediately so that it would not fall 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.460
 Maria Jose was slowly falling over 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.930
 the bank 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.930
 and almost lost consciousness 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.980
 We took her to the hospital here she stayed 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.320
 for 10 days I was informed that my daughter 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.460
 I suffered from a serious illness that 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.729
 seriously affected his heart 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.500
 but it was not something definitive there was 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.440
 practice other tests to get to 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.440
 a firm diagnosis 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.620
 for you 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.430
 I'm going to die, it's not true that they told you 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 the doctors truth not my love you 're not going to 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.360
 die god that is so big no 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.740
 would allow you to lose what has been most 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.530
 loved in the world 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.060
 here 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.670
 who die somewhere 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.940
 can see from above people 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.940
 dear ones 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.069
 you know if they can go back 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.630
 good daughter 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.240
 in truth nobody has returned from there to 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.400
 tell something about that but 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.409
 If I died I would not leave you alone 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.079
 being in the hereafter I would seek the 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.909
 way to communicate with you in the last 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.000
 instance would use the wind to 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.190
 come see you 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.880
 wind 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.640
 and how would you do that for yourself 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.440
 I have no idea daughter, I only know that 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.870
 If I die one day, you'll feel like I'm 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.110
 with you when a gentle wind touches your 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.270
 face 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.270
 and a cool breeze sometimes your cheeks 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.480
 that same day in the afternoon they called the 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.100
 father 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.870
 the matter was serious 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.870
 his daughter was dying 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.880
 they needed a heart because hers 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.390
 I would not resist but fifteen or twenty 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.390
 more days 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.799
 a heart 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.799
 where do I get a heart 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.810
 that same month mariajo would fulfill its 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.120
 15 years 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.670
 It was Friday afternoon when 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.160
 they got a donor 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.160
 things were going to change 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.230
 and so 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.530
 Sunday afternoon 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.690
 Maria Jose was operated 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.620
 total success 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.989
 but nevertheless 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.200
 dad had not come back through the hospital and 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.379
 Maria Jose missed him very much her 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.489
 Mommy told her that everything would be fine and the 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.489
 he embraced tenderly 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.460
 later on when everyone arrived home 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.550
 they sat on a huge sofa and their mom with 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.560
 the eyes full of tears 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.180
 he gave himself to Maria Jose 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.180
 a letter from his father 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.169
 Maria Jose 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.169
 my great love 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:47.339
 at the time of reading my letter you must have 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.100
 15 years old and a strong heart beating in 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.470
 your chest 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.770
 that was the promise of the doctors that you 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.770
 they operated 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.689
 you can not even remotely imagine 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.199
 how sorry I am not to be by your side in 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.199
 this instant 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.639
 when I knew you were going to die 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.650
 I felt that I too would die with you 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.650
 and he asked us what could he do 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:24.429
 after so much thinking and feeling a thousand 

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:26.579
 things inside of me I decided and finally 

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:29.379
 that the best way to do something for you 

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:31.319
 was to answer a question that 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.420
 you did to me when you were ten years old 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.440
 remember 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.400
 and in which 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.400
 does not answer 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.539
 I decided to make you the most beautiful gift that 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.539
 nobody has ever done 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.300
 my heart 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.980
 I give you my whole life without condition 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.860
 some for you to do with it what 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.139
 you think it's better to feel many 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.409
 beautiful things and knowing that in the world 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.770
 the most important 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:14.419
 is you want to live longer lives 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.419
 I will always be by your side 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.320
 and I will always love you 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.190
 because you are the greatest and most beautiful thing 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.190
 God has given me 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.169
 I love Maria Jose 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.000
 Maria I cry all day and all the 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.000
 night 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.409
 the next day 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.210
 it was the cemetery and he sat on the 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:51.199
 grave of his dad 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.199
 and whisper 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.439
 walking 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.370
 Now I can understand how much you loved me 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.270
 I love you too and will honor you for 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.500
 forever 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.500
 and in that instant 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.520
 the tops of the trees moved 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.720
 slightly 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.920
 and some flowers fell 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.030
 Maria felt that a soft wind 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.470
 sugar cross 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.760
 and a cool breeze 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.760
 kissed his cheeks 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:33.800
 In the sun, look at the sky feeling a 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.849
 immense peace 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.940
 and he thanked God for that 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:42.280
 got up 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.600
 the way home with the joy of knowing 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.600
 that he carries in his heart 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.060
 and the greatest love in the world
