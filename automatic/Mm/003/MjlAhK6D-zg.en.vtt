 moon eclipsed and you 'll say what it means 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.540
 Well, I 'm telling you, this chapter is in 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.570
 place number 7 not because your subject is 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.930
 of this type but because it hides things 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 dark as the inhabitants of the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.899
 instead they had to wear something 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.479
 so that neymar night did not eat them 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.580
 this can not sound very scary 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:28.620
 but it is number 7 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.410
 number 6 dragon chai this chapter 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.320
 initiates in a way not bad at 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.930
 contrary to the beginning there are reuters there 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 the most tender and sweet of the six 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 protagonists is feeding the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.690
 animals but that part and many the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.630
 you know so we'll go to the weird and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.960
 morbid the weird starts when it floated 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.720
 Tersa and see a strange smoke that comes from 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.300
 a mountain then the town goes and what 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.780
 try to vulgar but nobody in the take 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:05.060
 in mind but for your twilight luck 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.360
 he divulges it and comments that it is not bad 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.150
 it's just a good sleeping dragon can 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.990
 end this make it float saint 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.640
 amans the dragon but all his attempts 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.160
 fail 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.490
 but there comes a time when the dragon 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.700
 harms her friends and flutter side arms 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.220
 of value and confronts it the terrifying thing is 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.860
 that like a pretty one in tender came 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.560
 until crying to a beast that for several 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.120
 times in history was to get to 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:43.280
 be feared number 666 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.190
 number 5 greed attack this chapter 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.790
 it's kind of disturbing because of the fact that 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.220
 we all know spies like a dragon 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.860
 small and friendly but in this chapter 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.370
 shows what greed can come 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.430
 to provoke good this chapter starts 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.220
 with spike's birthday and what's up 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.280
 is that everyone gives him something and he says 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.000
 that they had never given him anything that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.569
 Only trailer gives you a book 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.549
 let's follow the pony bill and it's 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.299
 telling the people that it's their birthday 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:23.359
 in order to receive something but nobody 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.959
 gives nothing so he decides to steal the 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:30.349
 things of others but weird and morbid 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:36.680
 is that it grows the more it steals 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:39.739
 number 5 5 and number 4 too many pink and 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.109
 spies here we are already entering at the most 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.910
 dark because as the title says 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.300
 pink 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.700
 and this has a problem of yours is to be 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.670
 in all the places where that friend is 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.550
 they have fun so first take the time 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.400
 to see how long it takes to get from a 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.070
 place to another but that is not very 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.760
 efficient so choose to go to the lake 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.730
 mirror to clone and that works 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.670
 but you need more of them to cover 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.790
 the other ponies unfortunately the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.060
 cloning is carried to excess and as everything 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.600
 in excess it becomes a problem like this 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.670
 that the town takes letters in the matter 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.490
 so they try to get rid of them 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.150
 why twilight makes her look like 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.750
 dry the paint and the one that is distracted 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.750
 I would return it but the weird thing that puts you 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.889
 to think is what if you sent her to 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.509
 the real pink and the lake 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.509
 number 4 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:50.140
 No. 3 demonstration inspiration you 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.840
 I notice from here on, run for 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.870
 Your account I do not take responsibility for 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.990
 the problems that this occasions you but 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.840
 I invite you to join me in this top 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.060
 well let's start with number 3 this 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.700
 chapter starred by rare it and 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.370
 try that she is making a 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.160
 small cabin for a puppeteer but 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.680
 unfortunately the puppeteer does not 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.230
 like and rejects 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.740
 that makes it feel very bad but it 's for 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.040
 his lapdog encourage trafficking without 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.720
 But she feels worse but he with 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.390
 the intention to help her looks for a 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.730
 spell and get it a spell that 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.070
 it improved things but she 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.350
 obsesses with this and that puts you 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:40.060
 think that it will have done to the brain 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:44.710
 so do sessions like that number 33 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.200
 number 2 or party for one like the 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.440
 title says this chapter deals with 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.800
 pink pay that organized a party for the 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.750
 gumi birthday your pet everything is going 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.930
 well nothing was normal 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.940
 her friends accompany him and have a good time 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.880
 but she wants him to stay in a 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.300
 moment more but they just want to leave 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.180
 to their homes and they tell him that later he 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.120
 Take it as early so invite them to 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.820
 all to another party in the afternoon but 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.389
 none can go which makes her think 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.560
 that they do not want to be friends anymore 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.590
 something that leads to a great depression 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.390
 on the verge of suicide and madness 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:31.860
 extreme number 22 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:35.970

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.580
 previous you trauma let me tell you that no 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.120
 have you heard this in this chapter

 twilight and spike are organizing their 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.760
 house but you can notice that it is 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.430
 taking very seriously and who wants that 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.340
 everything is perfectly so it makes 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.130
 that everything looks perfect that leads to 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.090
 an obsession that everything must come out 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.770
 perfect whose consequence is madness 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:07.900
 frantic and ruthless that the effects 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:10.750
 they were damage to others number 1 11
