00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello everyone greets you again Jorge 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.680
 mendoza now let's see the three 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.240
 basic positions of my chord 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.280
 greater for which we need to join a 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:22.160
 sustained sun and a yes 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:24.760
 has sustained me and if I remembered my older 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.760
 two 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.660
 ok this is the fundamental position of 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.660
 chord 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 we change the order now we do 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 I am sustained if I 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 I remember you it 's the first investment 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.219
 we change the order and we go like this my sun 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.210
 this is second investment 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.750
 I remember what we are seeing in 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.140
 each video is the chord and its positions 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.180
 basic because you need to learn 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.730
 this so that you can move with more 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.730
 freedom and being able to connect the chords 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.229
 and we repeat 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 the notes in general are my sun 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.100
 then my oldest 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.890
 everyone 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.170
 this fundamental fundamental position 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.369
 i 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.369
 first investment 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.680
 and second investment 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.369
