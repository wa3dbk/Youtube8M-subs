this<00:00:12.660> mirror<00:00:12.990> would<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.490> mirror

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
this mirror would be of the mirror

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.830 
this mirror would be of the mirror
mirror<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> wall<00:00:16.520> variety<00:00:17.600> you<00:00:18.600> know<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
mirror on the wall variety you know the

plot<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.840> we're<00:00:24.930> gonna<00:00:25.050> start<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.410> drawing<00:00:25.710> an

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
plot so we're gonna start by drawing an

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.380 
plot so we're gonna start by drawing an
oval<00:00:26.820> shape<00:00:28.340> good<00:00:29.340> practice<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.060> learning

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
oval shape good practice for learning

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.359 
oval shape good practice for learning
how<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.480> draw<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.869> shapes<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.040> now

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
how to draw your shapes and now

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
how to draw your shapes and now
obviously<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.000> magic<00:00:33.390> mirror<00:00:33.600> cannot<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.469> be

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
obviously a magic mirror cannot just be

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.080 
obviously a magic mirror cannot just be
some<00:00:34.770> regular<00:00:35.070> boring<00:00:35.340> old<00:00:35.520> mirror<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.969> have

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
some regular boring old mirror we have

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.110 
some regular boring old mirror we have
to<00:00:36.270> make<00:00:36.559> sort<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> fun<00:00:37.980> pattern<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> design

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
to make sort of a fun pattern and design

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.959 
to make sort of a fun pattern and design
for<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.550> can't<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
for this thing you can't just be a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.229 
for this thing you can't just be a
boring<00:00:42.390> old<00:00:43.399> glass<00:00:44.399> shape<00:00:44.700> thing<00:00:44.910> unless<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
boring old glass shape thing unless you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.729 
boring old glass shape thing unless you
know<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.870> prerogative<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.649> do

they own the the copyright to it so
let's<00:02:52.450> draw<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.170> floating<00:02:53.760> odd<00:02:54.760> masked

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
let's draw like the floating odd masked

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.059 
let's draw like the floating odd masked
shaped<00:02:56.019> face<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.769> fire<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.680> mirror

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
shaped face in the fire the mirror

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:26.020 
shaped face in the fire the mirror
mirror<00:03:03.579> on<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.849> wall<00:03:04.120> guru<00:03:07.709> floating<00:03:09.750> face

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.460 

and<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:27.020> obviously<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:30.050> can<00:03:30.170> make<00:03:30.290> this

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
and this is obviously you can make this

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.610 
and this is obviously you can make this
as<00:03:30.710> spooky<00:03:30.980> or<00:03:31.370> as<00:03:31.720> I'm<00:03:32.720> spooky<00:03:33.290> as<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.590> want

as spooky or as I'm spooky as you want

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.870 
as spooky or as I'm spooky as you want
this<00:03:36.620> would<00:03:36.770> be<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.980> little<00:03:37.100> guy<00:03:37.280> floating<00:03:37.760> up

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
this would be the little guy floating up

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.260 
this would be the little guy floating up
out<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.210> the<00:03:38.330> middle<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.840> give<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.680> device

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
out of the middle to give you a device

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.860 
out of the middle to give you a device
there<00:03:41.270> you<00:03:41.420> go

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
there you go
