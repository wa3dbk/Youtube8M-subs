00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.219 
this is just one of my favorite things
but<00:04:15.879> what<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.060> really<00:04:16.359> love<00:04:16.539> is<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.840> amount

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
but what I really love is the amount

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.610 
but what I really love is the amount
that<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.680> can<00:04:17.889> hold<00:04:18.810> it's<00:04:19.810> just<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:20.320> just<00:04:20.440> so

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
that it can hold it's just it's just so

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.439 
that it can hold it's just it's just so
much<00:04:21.039> food<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.549> when<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.759> live<00:04:21.970> out<00:04:22.120> on<00:04:22.419> the

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
much food and when you live out on the

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.990 
much food and when you live out on the
ranch<00:04:22.690> like<00:04:22.930> we<00:04:23.110> do<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.680> shop<00:04:24.009> you<00:04:24.759> know<00:04:24.849> we

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
ranch like we do and shop you know we

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.240 
ranch like we do and shop you know we
buy<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.539> a<00:04:25.660> bigger<00:04:25.840> bulk<00:04:26.199> of<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.770> lot<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:27.039> things

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
buy in a bigger bulk of a lot of things

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.310 
buy in a bigger bulk of a lot of things
and<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.090> go<00:04:28.210> through<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.509> lot<00:04:28.630> having<00:04:29.110> all<00:04:29.229> the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
and we go through a lot having all the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.140 
and we go through a lot having all the
boys<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.770> then<00:04:29.889> feeding<00:04:30.130> cowboys<00:04:30.759> and<00:04:30.970> such

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
boys and then feeding cowboys and such

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.020 
boys and then feeding cowboys and such
so<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:33.039> holds<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.370> massive<00:04:33.729> amount<00:04:33.970> of

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
so so it holds a massive amount of

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
so so it holds a massive amount of
storage<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.509> I<00:04:34.570> really<00:04:35.259> love<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.460> just
