00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
machine noise that sounds you in the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.480 
machine noise that sounds you in the
background<00:02:48.260> well<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.800> actually<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
obviously the fruit machine one is the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.180 
obviously the fruit machine one is the

question here partly it's money you know
can<00:03:49.940> they<00:03:50.060> actually<00:03:50.209> raise<00:03:50.630> enough<00:03:51.080> money<00:03:51.110> to

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
can they actually raise enough money to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.290 
can they actually raise enough money to
keep<00:03:51.709> on<00:03:51.980> with<00:03:52.130> these<00:03:52.250> bailouts<00:03:52.670> but

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
keep on with these bailouts but

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.720 
keep on with these bailouts but
ultimately<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:54.290> comes<00:03:54.530> down<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.950> politics<00:03:55.459> and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
ultimately it comes down to politics and

buying up its own debt all we're doing

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.400 
buying up its own debt all we're doing
is<00:04:34.820> prolonging<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.419> agony<00:04:35.449> and<00:04:35.930> making<00:04:36.289> the

British<00:04:39.650> back<00:04:39.830> then<00:04:40.009> would<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.130> be<00:04:40.310> desirable

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
British back then would it be desirable

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.340 
British back then would it be desirable
for<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.030> eurozone<00:04:41.449> simply<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:41.900> fall<00:04:42.080> apart

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
for the eurozone simply to fall apart

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.620 
for the eurozone simply to fall apart
right<00:04:42.560> now<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:43.340> would<00:04:43.550> be<00:04:43.639> desirable<00:04:43.970> I<00:04:44.360> think

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
right now it would be desirable I think

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.810 
right now it would be desirable I think
for<00:04:44.810> countries<00:04:45.169> like<00:04:45.199> Greece<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:46.250> be<00:04:46.370> helped

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
for countries like Greece to be helped

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.270 
for countries like Greece to be helped
to<00:04:47.270> get<00:04:47.630> back<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.139> their<00:04:48.259> own<00:04:48.380> currencies<00:04:48.650> yes

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
to get back to their own currencies yes

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.580 
to get back to their own currencies yes
it'll<00:04:49.460> mean<00:04:49.729> big<00:04:49.970> devaluation<00:04:50.810> yes<00:04:51.410> it'll

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
it'll mean big devaluation yes it'll

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.200 
it'll mean big devaluation yes it'll
