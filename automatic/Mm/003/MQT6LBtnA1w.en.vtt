00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
hi it's Mike from Pro Tools expert again

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.830 
hi it's Mike from Pro Tools expert again
and<00:00:09.070> I'm<00:00:09.610> going<00:00:09.820> to<00:00:09.879> show<00:00:10.059> you<00:00:10.090> a<00:00:10.240> little<00:00:10.420> slag

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
and I'm going to show you a little slag

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.390 
and I'm going to show you a little slag
that<00:00:10.869> I've<00:00:11.200> come<00:00:11.379> across<00:00:11.610> when<00:00:12.610> using<00:00:13.299> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
that I've come across when using the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.060 
that I've come across when using the
when<00:00:15.400> using<00:00:15.580> an<00:00:15.820> Apple<00:00:16.180> Mighty<00:00:16.390> Mouse<00:00:16.720> I<00:00:17.199> came

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
when using an Apple Mighty Mouse I came

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.009 
when using an Apple Mighty Mouse I came
across<00:00:18.220> this<00:00:18.609> when<00:00:18.880> I<00:00:18.910> was<00:00:19.269> looking<00:00:19.900> at

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
across this when I was looking at

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.200 
across this when I was looking at
different<00:00:20.050> zooming<00:00:20.890> techniques<00:00:21.519> for

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
different zooming techniques for

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.240 
different zooming techniques for
instance<00:00:22.510> we<00:00:22.600> had<00:00:22.780> a<00:00:22.810> tip<00:00:23.080> come<00:00:23.440> in<00:00:23.590> where<00:00:23.980> if

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
instance we had a tip come in where if

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.359 
instance we had a tip come in where if
you<00:00:24.460> go<00:00:24.760> to<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.449> zoom<00:00:25.660> tool<00:00:25.960> and<00:00:26.199> now<00:00:27.010> hold

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
you go to the zoom tool and now hold

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.180 
you go to the zoom tool and now hold
down<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.670> control<00:00:28.570> key<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.110> as<00:00:29.680> I<00:00:29.860> drag<00:00:30.130> you

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
down the control key and as I drag you

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.790 
down the control key and as I drag you
can<00:00:30.520> see<00:00:30.760> that<00:00:30.910> I<00:00:30.940> can<00:00:31.210> change<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.960> wave<00:00:32.439> form

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
can see that I can change the wave form

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.580 
can see that I can change the wave form
height<00:00:33.039> just<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.180> one<00:00:34.480> try<00:00:34.750> not<00:00:35.109> changing

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
height just of that one try not changing

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.069 
height just of that one try not changing
the<00:00:35.680> volume<00:00:35.829> not<00:00:36.219> changing<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.730> gain<00:00:37.079> just

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
the volume not changing the gain just

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.180 
the volume not changing the gain just
purely<00:00:38.679> a<00:00:38.710> display<00:00:39.309> just<00:00:40.199> purely<00:00:41.199> using<00:00:41.499> it<00:00:41.829> to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
purely a display just purely using it to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
purely a display just purely using it to
modify<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:43.530> modify<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.589> waveform<00:00:45.249> display

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
modify the modify the waveform display

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.599 
modify the modify the waveform display
so<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.429> snag<00:00:48.969> is<00:00:49.269> this<00:00:49.769> when<00:00:50.769> using<00:00:50.979> an<00:00:51.249> Apple

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
so the snag is this when using an Apple

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.360 
so the snag is this when using an Apple
Mighty<00:00:51.819> Mouse<00:00:52.319> if<00:00:53.319> you<00:00:53.499> hold<00:00:53.769> down<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:54.039> Alt

with the Mighty Mouse if I now scroll

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.820 
with the Mighty Mouse if I now scroll
where<00:01:11.800> up<00:01:12.040> down<00:01:12.760> you<00:01:13.150> can<00:01:14.050> see<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.320> the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
where up down you can see that the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.360 
where up down you can see that the
timeline<00:01:15.220> is<00:01:15.910> zooming<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.380> out<00:01:17.830> so<00:01:18.160> as<00:01:18.220> I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
timeline is zooming in and out so as I

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.120 
timeline is zooming in and out so as I
go<00:01:18.520> in<00:01:18.730> I'm<00:01:19.630> scrolling<00:01:19.900> up<00:01:20.170> now<00:01:20.530> if<00:01:20.680> I<00:01:20.800> scroll

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
go in I'm scrolling up now if I scroll

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.660 
go in I'm scrolling up now if I scroll
down<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.620> can<00:01:23.800> see<00:01:24.010> that<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.220> can<00:01:24.280> zoom

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
down then you can see that I can zoom

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.240 
down then you can see that I can zoom
right<00:01:24.880> out<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:26.830> go<00:01:27.060> sideways<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.070> can

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
right out if I go sideways then you can

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.200 
right out if I go sideways then you can
see<00:01:30.520> now<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.780> all<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.380> waveforms<00:01:33.250> are

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
see now that the all the waveforms are

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.800 
see now that the all the waveforms are
being<00:01:34.810> zoomed<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.350> on<00:01:35.470> all<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.340> tracks<00:01:36.810> now

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
being zoomed in on all of the tracks now

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.720 
being zoomed in on all of the tracks now
that<00:01:37.990> seems<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.620> me<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.980> be<00:01:39.010> counterintuitive

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
that seems to me to be counterintuitive

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.480 
that seems to me to be counterintuitive
I<00:01:40.630> want<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.800> be<00:01:41.950> able<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.220> go<00:01:42.400> up<00:01:42.610> down<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:45.340> be

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
I want to be able to go up down to be

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.730 
I want to be able to go up down to be
able<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.850> zoom<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.540> waveforms<00:01:47.230> in<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.560> out

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
able to zoom the waveforms in and out

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.560 
able to zoom the waveforms in and out
and<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.430> want<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.730> go<00:01:48.880> left<00:01:49.270> right<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:52.270> be<00:01:52.420> able

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
and I want to go left right to be able

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.050 
and I want to go left right to be able
to<00:01:52.930> zoom<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.530> timeline<00:01:54.040> in<00:01:54.220> not<00:01:54.520> going<00:01:54.850> up

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
to zoom the timeline in not going up

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.760 
to zoom the timeline in not going up
down<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:59.050> alternative

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
down and there is the alternative

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.700 
down and there is the alternative
shortcut<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.400> normal<00:02:00.730> shortcut<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.020> hold

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
shortcut the normal shortcut is to hold

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.770 
shortcut the normal shortcut is to hold
down<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.010> shift<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.700> alt<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.180> then<00:02:04.600> that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
down the shift and alt and then that

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.600 
down the shift and alt and then that
will<00:02:04.930> do<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.380> other<00:02:05.409> way<00:02:05.740> but<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.400> makes

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
will do it the other way but that makes

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.660 
will do it the other way but that makes
no<00:02:07.120> difference<00:02:07.440> with<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.649> Apple<00:02:09.190> Mighty
