00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.700
 Okay good morning, I do not believe you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.519
 menezes swimming instructor here and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.120
 Can you expect to give a basic lesson here? 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.519
 which was posted on the internet and on the sides 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 required for illuminated survival 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.830
 base with all competitions 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 require right here is the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.740
 here are my students and now I 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.779
 present that is the front crawl nothing 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.510
 that is and the result is faster every 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.329
 four teachers in the holy breath and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.620
 beating legs always relax and teach 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.300
 it's not complicated 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 here has a 12 meter pool 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.260
 quiet 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.800
 how are you watching now let's go 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 to carry out the practice of nothingness 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.250
 It's important, then, that we 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.910
 first breath and then nothing and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910
 to roll 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.840
 I have with you this central idea and 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.300
 You saw them from the neighborhood. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.070
 But you have practice you have to have 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.540
 care that water does not have hair has 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.060
 How do we handle it here? 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.280
 pool is a shallow thing to do 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.300
 I'll introduce you to work now. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.800
 chest 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.290
 this is the name used in open sea 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.330
 pool is widely used in the cloud is a 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.940
 side that there is a greater rest 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.190
 there is a greater work of the muscles of 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.830
 the whole set and have to be careful 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.690
 always works in the breath and the truth 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.320
 this is important in swimming run 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.320
 nothing has been done now 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 As leonardo was noted, it was not 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.470
 use the Fernanda and embrace the same 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.840
 time as the stride is performed 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 with the term goes ahead by year the water 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.200
 when it is only closed with the arm 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.030
 the obvious the arm opens and comes to the feat is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.980
 this will happen what the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.170
 greater slip in pool 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.320
 the case opens both at the same time go 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.690
 see the brake to break from the realization of 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.520
 strength of one of the monsters 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.270
 I will now hold you to one side 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.270
 dolphin 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.200
 as perceived the side the wire is one side 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.360
 quite complicated 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.280
 There's nothing much but it's complicated. 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.280
 Who does not know how to swim? 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.620
 really is very difficult to perform 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.459
 You have to give two punches and one 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.050
 stroke 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.510
 so you will develop a 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.190
 Good speed in the pool is one side 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.380
 performed by a pool on the beach is not 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.650
 indicated by the waves of the house of the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.650
 Mom is going to end up knocking on the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:35.319
 new will work will be a very side 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:39.370
 bad but it is a very personal effect - now 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.849
 coastline is a simple side but 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.130
 We're working with water, it was not for 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.890
 being practiced at random is 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.810
 someone who can supervise someone who 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.720
 Can you take care of it to happen? 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.440
 something you say may have a camera 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.400
 one thing that really is is happens 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.109
 happens is fact is recorded and I know that 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.739
 have an older care now 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.739
 backstroke 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.470
 That's it, the backstroke as seen 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.590
 It's a bigger job you're not seeing. 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.150
 which is hair behind you so have to 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.940
 if you take care you have a side to be 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.150
 done in pool with someone supervising 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.699
 Your name is correct, I'll tell you. 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.310
 now over nothing or over breathing 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.289
 that the inspiration that is fundamental in 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.880
 swimming that there has to be before 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:52.800
 during and after approaching swimming to 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.900
 breath what many instructors 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.750
 They call the end claw I call spray 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.300
 had this been fooled by me you 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.590
 have to perform the ambiance with the 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.039
 that water and the breath for you 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.509
 rest to eliminate the carbon bunch 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.699
 What about you guys are you going to have a 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.789
 better development in the water 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.270
 inspiration is simple pulled and released and 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.270
 it was enough 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.639
 only that only making the repetition 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.580
 2011 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.240
 Can you get a bigger rest from the 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.139
 your body and perform a side mode is this 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.119
 that's personal 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.860
 This is the brief class I have to 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:44.839
 pass you swimming 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.339
 I hope you liked it was the 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:53.960
 my team here said francisco praxe 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:59.149
 should a student friend say June the 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.610
 brother on the network of other 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:03.499
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.529
 briefly is teaching her turn in 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:08.449
 chapter in my class and that's it 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.520
 I really liked to have passed on to you. 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.300
 I hope you enjoy and that you have 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.300
 It was that for you
