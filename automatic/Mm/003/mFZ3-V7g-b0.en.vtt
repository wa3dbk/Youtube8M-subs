00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.660
 australia a land of unique species 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:19.779
 some of them already extinct and forgotten 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.510
 such is the case of this animal the tiger 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.430
 Tasmania better known as thylacine 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.520
 a species that seems taken from a 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.820
 fictional tale this animal keeps 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.800
 similar to the Tasmanian demon its 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.989
 tail resembles that of a kangaroo and has 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.870
 black stripes like those of a tiger there 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.300
 its name unfortunately the thylacine 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.879
 they have just as other species disappeared 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.920
 due to the presence of the human being 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.559
 believes that hunting was the main cause 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.020
 of his disappearance but also 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.719
 they helped the extinction diseases 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.270
 the arrival of the dogs brought by the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.250
 settlers and finally that being 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.030
 human invaded his territory to 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.489
 settle 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.800
 There is no doubt that human beings have already 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.049
 eliminated species in the past but 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.440
 what the thylacine is just an example of what 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.840
 that suffer hundreds of species today the 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.180
 tasmania tiger who possessed the quality 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.790
 to be able to open his snout almost to the maximum 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.550
 and observers of that time assure that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.619
 his diet was strictly on his way 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.140
 says he could hunt in small groups 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.299
 relatives and he also used tactics 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.400
 of ambush to tire and confuse 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.100
 its prey 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.090
 their most usual prey were the rats 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.550
 calculations the small birds bombs and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.290
 also friendship if the name of the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.660
 Wallabies sounds familiar to you 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.180
 probably because rock or is based 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.860
 in not just rock or is it taken out of 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.620
 australia and its surroundings 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.030
 there is also the devil of tazmania and 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.030
 crash bandicoot 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.930
 the thylacine managed to make its appearance 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.740
 as a character when in 2012 he premiered the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.750
 game 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.530
 haydeÃ© tasmanian tigger for the nintendo 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.930
 gamecube and the playstation 2 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.959
 to the strip but you can also see it in a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.540
 museum of Tasmania as a stuffed animal and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.200
 his most important appearance on the shield 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.200
 more skill 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.740
 these are the last images of a 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.220
 specimen like this 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.040
 was captured in 1933 and taken to a 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.450
 zoo in pasman and unfortunately 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.520
 died on September 7, 1936 it is believed 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.950
 that the causes of his death were a 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.800
 strange meteorological event in tasmania 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.900
 where he suffered suffocating heat of day and of 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.770
 night was exposed to cold 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.930
 glacial nowadays in australia every 7 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.510
 September is the national day 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.520

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.730
 commemorate the death of the last wolf 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.740
 marsupial officially registered this 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.500
 animal shows us the damage that the 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.110
 humanity can cause and leave us as 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.630
 lesson that we have the duty to take care of 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.980
 the beings that surround us so we do not 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.980
 repeat your story
