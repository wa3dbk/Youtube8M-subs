we'll start off by taking a quick look
at<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.890> my<00:00:04.980> hotkey<00:00:05.220> editor<00:00:07.189> the<00:00:08.189> hotkey

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
at the my hotkey editor the hotkey

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.159 
at the my hotkey editor the hotkey
editor<00:00:08.580> inside<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.330> Maya<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.599> really<00:00:09.809> easy<00:00:09.990> to

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:10.169

organized in a way that not only helps
you<00:00:20.310> find<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> hotkey<00:00:21.119> over<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> right

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
you find the hotkey over to the right

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.169 
you find the hotkey over to the right
you<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.349> just<00:00:22.410> query<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.070> particular<00:00:23.609> key<00:00:23.880> say

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
you can just query a particular key say

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.150 
you can just query a particular key say
q<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> hit<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> query<00:00:25.410> button<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> tells<00:00:26.039> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
q and hit the query button it tells you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.339 
q and hit the query button it tells you
what<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.699> assigned<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
what that is assigned to but then it

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.620 
what that is assigned to but then it
helps<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:29.060> finding<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> command<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
helps you in finding the command that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.200 
helps you in finding the command that
you<00:00:30.689> might<00:00:30.960> want<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.259> use<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.310> all<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:33.090> the

the different types of displays I know
that<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.450> grid<00:00:54.630> is<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> toggle<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.950> there's

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
that the grid is a toggle and so there's

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.580 
that the grid is a toggle and so there's
my<00:00:56.280> toggle<00:00:56.580> command<00:00:57.030> listed<00:00:57.810> down<00:00:57.960> below<00:00:58.020> for

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
my toggle command listed down below for

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.350 
my toggle command listed down below for
me<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> Python<00:00:59.400> command<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.090> easily

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
me if it's a Python command I can easily

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.260 
me if it's a Python command I can easily
access<00:01:00.630> that<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.310> I'm

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
access that as well but for now I'm
gonna<00:01:03.480> find<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:04.019> key<00:01:04.260> that'll<00:01:04.500> work<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:04.949> now

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
gonna find a key that'll work for me now

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.569 
gonna find a key that'll work for me now
that's<00:01:05.460> another<00:01:05.700> problem<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.689> keys<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.579> not

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
that's another problem what keys are not

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.840 
that's another problem what keys are not
listed<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.329> not<00:01:09.479> used<00:01:09.869> currently<00:01:10.700> well<00:01:11.700> Maya

has<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> nice<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> listing<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.710> keys

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
has a nice way of listing all the keys

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.620 
has a nice way of listing all the keys
that<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.579> associated<00:01:15.359> with
