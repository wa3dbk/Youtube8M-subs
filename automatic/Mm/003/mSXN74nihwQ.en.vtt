00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.030
 Talk about beauty in every game in the area. 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.890
 today I came to give an important tip is that 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.190
 several people came to ask me 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:19.510
 how much in my fan pg so much in the 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.750
 channel on direct 12 is not yet 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.449
 available in 2 10 and why not 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.940
 we bring the comparative tests yet 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.340
 do you think i did it on windows 8.1 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.769
 people this tip to run is very important 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.199
 think enough because you will not 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.940
 difference in df is 100 is at least 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.960
 hdmi input and I will explain why 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.989
 also ne 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.629
 and even for us 750 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.469
 there is still not much change 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.889
 like this 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.329
 in a matter of ips only in some games or 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.719
 another has a performance gain 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.879
 because the memory the memory for who has 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.829
 a 1-gigabyte video card that 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.609
 demands of me is 1 gig. 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.090
 the improvement is having because the windows 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.430
 10 now with directx 12 he he only one 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.320
 when his memory celebrates iron 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.050
 that is, if you play a game that requires 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.360
 plus one of 1 gb of ram it will add 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.910
 these two items and will add more sold 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.030
 more for intel hd people can not 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.730
 push more than 1 gig it's depends 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 of your intel hd for 44 mine it does not 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.750
 they get with more than a gigabyte 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.240
 to get more power get you 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.680
 would have to add musician filters then 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.220
 by this factor that is not having 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.080
 improvements understood not to have an idea 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.540
 I 'll explain why it's also the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.790
 directx 12 then there are people direct from 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.810
 two will be a package in the then water of 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.100
 grace above the 4400 will be supported below 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.790
 4400 will not be supported or 44 in 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.150
 before only the hd belt and protÃ©gÃ© irises 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.680
 they can one is the updated drive 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.990
 automatically i will give an example people 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 for those who have a custom drive and who 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.220
 attracts custom manufacturer is that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.230
 in exchange for family to whom it has this 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.270
 intel hd people you have not 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:17.440
 search google for brand 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.360
 how dodo your notebook is and act and search 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.990
 This one will have updates to bring from there. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.540
 huh 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.270
 understood not by the method of teaching you 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.870
 normal to upgrade by the drive there 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.090
 huh 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.720
 so I 'll give you a good example of the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.670
 my video card of 17 159 is that I 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:48.850
 I'll search my board template. 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:51.220
 mother asus h 81 m cmr look at the brand of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.230
 model of your notebook computer and vi 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:03.430
 on the site look for the right drive and came 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:06.040
 here the support drives tools to eu 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.160
 I've already taken it just like that, asus is very faithful. 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.640
 your drive businesses already have everything 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.580
 10 drivers already attended to the chipset already 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.160
 has down windows of this order of 10 already 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.650
 was already released the audio drive was already 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.470
 open turned reality in the end you 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.580
 can be watching here is since the fall in 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.090
 exchange you touch graph there 1048 of 15 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.970
 42 48 29 5 2015 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.560
 This was the drive for anyone with a notebook. 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.690
 custom kill this dragon and 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.850
 gave in my case I will be there wires nor 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.530
 for those who do not know how to intel hd 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.360
 graphic will still have a link in the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.060
 video description has multiple videos 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.280
 teaching upgrade to windows 10 i 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.340
 I made a video now understood this video 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.130
 explain what will be the davi and what will 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.570
 be a direct x 2 or touch it 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.680
 for any model above the quota of 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.110
 400 people will be is just the scale daae 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:08.230
 the scale of three of the scale had an uncle 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:12.459
 23 h from all 71 and city â€‹â€‹1 will be going 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:16.150
 be a direct x 12 directx package 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.799
 emulated people understood for example the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.140
 people have a notion that she will be 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.510
 changed for example 1003 it has two 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.940
 real nuclei and two sides 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.830
 God is going to be basically me but it is 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.159
 one thing 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.740
 abdel rahman is but not to say that 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.300
 It will be but it's too bad. 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.719
 not on the contrary it will be very good 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.849
 having me add more dedicated memory 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:42.180
 will have improvements in games that came with the 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.490
 directx 11 or the hotel itself 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.520
 make the correct drive wait for 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.520
 microsoft to launch a direct pack 2 by 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.360
