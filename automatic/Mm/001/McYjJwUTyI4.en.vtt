some<00:01:16.960> cool<00:01:17.350> accent<00:01:17.800> so<00:01:18.010> instead<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.340> that

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
some cool accent so instead of that

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.770 
some cool accent so instead of that
straightforward<00:01:18.760> rhythm<00:01:19.240> we're<00:01:19.450> gonna<00:01:19.540> do<00:01:19.720> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
straightforward rhythm we're gonna do it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.890

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.460 

the<00:01:59.790> idea<00:02:00.300> what<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.690> sort<00:02:00.870> of<00:02:00.900> do<00:02:01.260> that

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
the idea what you can sort of do that

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.260 
the idea what you can sort of do that
since<00:02:01.710> we've<00:02:01.980> covered<00:02:02.220> all<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:02.520> sort<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
since we've covered all that sort of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.710 
since we've covered all that sort of
stuff<00:02:03.330> before<00:02:04.790> let's<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.000> look<00:02:06.150> at<00:02:06.360> some

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
stuff before let's have a look at some

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.230 
stuff before let's have a look at some
of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.870> chords<00:02:07.410> we<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.860> interchange<00:02:08.340> for

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
of the chords we can interchange for

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.480 
of the chords we can interchange for
these<00:02:09.420> ones<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.930> let's<00:02:10.290> say<00:02:10.650> instead<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.100> Iman

and<00:03:06.189> added<00:03:06.370> some<00:03:06.519> extra<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.879> stop<00:03:07.090> beam<00:03:07.299> but

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
and added some extra to stop beam but

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.569 
and added some extra to stop beam but
you<00:03:07.750> can<00:03:07.900> see<00:03:08.049> how<00:03:08.230> walls<00:03:08.439> using<00:03:08.829> some<00:03:09.340> bytes

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
you can see how walls using some bytes

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.360 
you can see how walls using some bytes
nut<00:03:09.849> runs<00:03:10.090> changing<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.930> rhythm<00:03:11.079> around<00:03:11.470> I'm

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
nut runs changing the rhythm around I'm

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.979 
nut runs changing the rhythm around I'm
gonna<00:03:12.640> leave<00:03:12.790> included<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.269> as<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.510> separate

I'm<00:04:03.240> not<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.600> machine<00:04:03.750> providing<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.470> this

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
I'm not a machine providing this this

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.590 
I'm not a machine providing this this
sort<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:04.980> stuff<00:04:05.190> you'll<00:04:05.490> get<00:04:05.730> used<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
sort of stuff you'll get used to the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.270 
sort of stuff you'll get used to the
different<00:04:06.870> sort<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.050> arpeggios<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.920> implied

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
different sort of arpeggios you implied

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.310 
different sort of arpeggios you implied
by<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.580> some<00:04:08.910> listening<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.720> more<00:04:09.870> music<00:04:09.900> and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
by the some listening to more music and

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.290 
by the some listening to more music and
playing<00:04:10.620> more<00:04:11.340> music<00:04:11.370> that's<00:04:11.850> that's<00:04:12.120> out

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
playing more music that's that's out

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.450 
playing more music that's that's out
there<00:04:12.530> one<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.680> things<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:14.040> was<00:04:14.130> sort<00:04:14.370> of

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
there one of the things I was sort of

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.070 
there one of the things I was sort of
using<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.970> little<00:04:15.120> bit<00:04:15.240> then<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.570> was<00:04:15.780> using<00:04:16.050> that

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
using a little bit then I was using that

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.970 
using a little bit then I was using that
hammer-on<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.680> pull-off<00:04:16.980> so<00:04:17.459> our<00:04:17.610> idea

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.790 

as<00:04:22.070> part<00:04:22.790> of<00:04:22.880> this<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:23.750> paid<00:04:24.110> you<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.320> patent<00:04:24.680> but

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
as part of this I paid you a patent but

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.070 
as part of this I paid you a patent but
you<00:04:25.280> don't<00:04:25.460> have<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.700> use<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:26.060> just<00:04:26.270> also<00:04:26.630> with

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
you don't have to use it just also with

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.980 
you don't have to use it just also with
arpeggios<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.950> can<00:04:28.100> play<00:04:28.340> say<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.720> part<00:04:29.900> of

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
arpeggios you can play say it's part of

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:42.180 
arpeggios you can play say it's part of
a<00:04:30.020> strong<00:04:30.290> pad<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:30.830> this

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.270 

so<00:04:42.970> you<00:04:43.030> can<00:04:43.270> include<00:04:43.570> those<00:04:43.980> they<00:04:44.980> are<00:04:45.100> sort

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
so you can include those they are sort

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.980 
so you can include those they are sort
of<00:04:45.310> embellishing<00:04:45.850> I'm<00:04:45.970> cool<00:04:46.240> it's<00:04:46.450> while<00:04:46.660> to

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
of embellishing I'm cool it's while to

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.900 
of embellishing I'm cool it's while to
be<00:04:47.080> using<00:04:47.440> those<00:04:47.620> hammer-on<00:04:48.220> pull-off<00:04:48.400> sort

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
be using those hammer-on pull-off sort

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.730 
be using those hammer-on pull-off sort
of<00:04:48.970> techniques<00:04:49.270> as<00:04:49.450> well<00:04:49.630> or<00:04:50.170> including

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
of techniques as well or including

00:04:50.740 --> 00:05:03.029 
of techniques as well or including
arpeggios<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.520> partly<00:04:51.820> strong

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.390 

so<00:05:04.259> same<00:05:05.259> chord<00:05:05.529> progression<00:05:05.559> member<00:05:06.129> or<00:05:06.219> just

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
so same chord progression member or just

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.859 
so same chord progression member or just
a<00:05:06.550> time<00:05:06.849> teaching<00:05:07.240> all<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.479> different<00:05:07.749> ways

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:07.869 
a time teaching all the different ways

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:09.989 
a time teaching all the different ways
that<00:05:08.169> you<00:05:08.319> can<00:05:08.499> build<00:05:09.009> on<00:05:09.249> this<00:05:09.369> and<00:05:09.639> make<00:05:09.789> it

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:09.999 
that you can build on this and make it

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.510 
that you can build on this and make it
more<00:05:10.210> interesting<00:05:10.629> for<00:05:10.839> you<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:11.830> let's<00:05:12.279> have<00:05:12.430> a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
more interesting for you so let's have a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.119 
more interesting for you so let's have a
look<00:05:12.610> at<00:05:12.849> palm<00:05:13.389> reading<00:05:13.719> so<00:05:13.990> first<00:05:14.649> of<00:05:14.860> all<00:05:14.979> we

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
look at palm reading so first of all we

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:16.589 
look at palm reading so first of all we
already<00:05:15.279> sort<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.610> looked<00:05:15.759> at<00:05:15.939> the<00:05:16.119> accents

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
already sort of looked at the accents

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.179 
already sort of looked at the accents
they<00:05:16.719> did<00:05:16.869> different<00:05:17.199> ones<00:05:17.319> way<00:05:17.469> we<00:05:17.680> can<00:05:17.860> do<00:05:17.949> it

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
they did different ones way we can do it

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.639 
they did different ones way we can do it
let<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.639> strike<00:05:18.939> we<00:05:19.119> pop<00:05:19.419> me<00:05:19.659> I<00:05:19.930> shall<00:05:20.439> play

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:20.649 
let the strike we pop me I shall play

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.619 
let the strike we pop me I shall play
upon<00:05:20.919> me<00:05:21.099> an<00:05:21.219> accents<00:05:21.729> so<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.270> can<00:05:22.419> sort<00:05:22.569> of

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
upon me an accents so you can sort of

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.329 
upon me an accents so you can sort of
seen<00:05:22.839> next<00:05:23.229> to<00:05:23.319> each<00:05:23.409> other<00:05:23.619> see<00:05:24.129> how<00:05:24.189> they're

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:24.339 
seen next to each other see how they're

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:25.170 
seen next to each other see how they're
not<00:05:24.399> exactly<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:24.879> same

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
not exactly the same

00:05:25.180 --> 00:06:08.250 
not exactly the same
that<00:05:25.449> gives<00:05:25.629> them<00:05:25.749> all<00:05:25.869> sort<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.139> results<00:05:26.529> okay

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.480 

so<00:06:09.260> I<00:06:09.320> promised<00:06:09.770> another<00:06:09.890> great<00:06:10.250> thing<00:06:10.430> you

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
so I promised another great thing you

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.750 
so I promised another great thing you
can<00:06:10.670> act<00:06:11.000> active<00:06:11.600> rhythms<00:06:11.930> so<00:06:12.580> threat<00:06:13.580> this

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
can act active rhythms so threat this
