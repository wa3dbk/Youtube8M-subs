if is in fact a Evo jr. I do not believe

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.599 
if is in fact a Evo jr. I do not believe
that<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.850> believe<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.209> it's<00:03:32.609> most

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
that it is I believe that it's most

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.460 
that it is I believe that it's most
likely<00:03:33.730> as<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.480> now<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.660> would<00:03:34.959> believe<00:03:35.140> it's<00:03:35.350> a

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
likely as of now I would believe it's a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.940 
likely as of now I would believe it's a
knockoff<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.230> pretty<00:03:38.410> good<00:03:38.560> knockoff

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
knockoff but it's a pretty good knockoff

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.440 
knockoff but it's a pretty good knockoff
is<00:03:39.160> knockoffs<00:03:39.519> go<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.030> there's<00:03:40.269> some

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
is knockoffs go but there's some

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.750 
is knockoffs go but there's some
differences<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:40.959> make<00:03:41.320> me<00:03:41.470> think<00:03:41.640> it's<00:03:42.640> a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
differences that make me think it's a

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.310 
differences that make me think it's a
knockoff<00:03:43.150> but<00:03:43.420> it's<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.630> good<00:03:43.780> knife<00:03:43.930> anyway

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320
