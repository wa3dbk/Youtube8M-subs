00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
time I didn't even know I hit it like I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.070 
time I didn't even know I hit it like I
didn't<00:01:04.199> pay<00:01:04.350> attention<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.900> it's<00:01:06.900> I

didn't pay attention to it I just it's I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
didn't pay attention to it I just it's I
had<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> watch<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.159> game<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.820> was

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
had to watch the game again and I was

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.030 
had to watch the game again and I was
like<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.110> saw<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
like I think I think I saw you know that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.469 
like I think I think I saw you know that
killfeed<00:01:11.430> look<00:01:11.580> weird<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.000> whatever<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.450> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
killfeed look weird or whatever so I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
killfeed look weird or whatever so I
looked<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:13.260> first<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.680> thought<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.950> might<00:01:14.040> have

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
looked at first I thought it might have

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.380 
looked at first I thought it might have
been<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> collapse<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.880> turns<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
been a collapse it turns out it was a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.530 
been a collapse it turns out it was a
triple<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.619> turns<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.700> very

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
triple and it also turns out it was very

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.100 
triple and it also turns out it was very
very<00:01:19.229> close<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> quad<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> hit<00:01:21.150> there

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
pop up on my radar so I come around the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
pop up on my radar so I come around the
corner<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.329> might<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.630> able<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.899> kill<00:01:58.049> him<00:01:58.290> I'm

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.440 
corner I might be able to kill him I'm
kind<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.280> cycling<00:01:59.490> around<00:01:59.790> outside<00:02:00.299> this

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
kind of just cycling around outside this

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
kind of just cycling around outside this
guy's<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:01.170> their<00:02:01.320> spawn<00:02:01.649> point<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.280> guy

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
guy's or their spawn point and this guy

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.010 
guy's or their spawn point and this guy
just<00:02:02.460> sneaks<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.119> me<00:02:03.180> I'm<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.479> sure<00:02:03.689> how<00:02:03.960> he

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
just sneaks up on me I'm not sure how he

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.230 
just sneaks up on me I'm not sure how he
kills<00:02:04.320> me<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.649> spawn<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> decide<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
kills me but spawn here and I decide I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570 
kills me but spawn here and I decide I
want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> throw<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:06.869> care<00:02:07.229> package<00:02:07.580> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
want to throw it on my care package it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 
want to throw it on my care package it
spawns<00:02:09.030> me<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> assumed<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.170> my

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
spawns me here so I assumed that my

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.229 
spawns me here so I assumed that my
team's<00:02:10.530> gonna<00:02:10.679> start<00:02:10.979> spawning<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.459> too<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
team's gonna start spawning here too and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.760 
team's gonna start spawning here too and
as<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.540> turns<00:02:12.750> out<00:02:12.959> that's<00:02:13.140> not<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.530> case

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
as it turns out that's not the case

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350 
as it turns out that's not the case
the<00:02:13.980> enemy<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.310> spawning<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the enemy is spawning here and I have to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940 
the enemy is spawning here and I have to
sit<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.840> try<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> defend<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:16.710> care

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
sit here and try to defend my care

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
sit here and try to defend my care
package<00:02:17.130> from<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.610> enemy<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.210> it's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
package from the enemy and it it's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.420 
package from the enemy and it it's
pretty<00:02:18.870> difficult<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.470> do<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.190> able<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
pretty difficult to do so I was able to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.670 
pretty difficult to do so I was able to
get<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.700> two<00:02:20.940> piece<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.510> pick<00:02:21.990> up<00:02:22.140> its<00:02:22.320> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
hunter killer and I throw it over here

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.220 
hunter killer and I throw it over here
because<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.390> know<00:02:24.450> they're<00:02:24.660> spawning<00:02:24.930> over

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.490 
snipe super well but if I pick one up I
can<00:05:09.090> usually<00:05:09.240> do<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.600> bit<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:09.960> work<00:05:10.050> with<00:05:10.350> it

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
can usually do a bit of work with it

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500 
can usually do a bit of work with it
anyway<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:11.310> guy<00:05:11.520> scares<00:05:11.880> me<00:05:12.090> this<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.330> just

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
anyway this guy scares me this is just

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.600 
anyway this guy scares me this is just
some<00:05:12.630> cod<00:05:12.870> timing<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.650> when<00:05:14.310> you<00:05:14.370> run<00:05:14.580> into

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
some cod timing and when you run into

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.640 
some cod timing and when you run into
somebody<00:05:15.030> like<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.330> it's<00:05:15.720> usually<00:05:16.320> good<00:05:16.500> in

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
somebody like that it's usually good in
