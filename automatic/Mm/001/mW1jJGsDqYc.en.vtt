00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.549
 street fighter meets team fortress 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.460
 2 and in the universe 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.260
 how is that supposed to look like ? 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.429
 at least according to peter holzapfel vom 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.340
 german developer yager development 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.960
 as well as dreadnought the new game of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.850
 spec ops maker combines classes 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 based multiplayer battles 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 a relatively demanding 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.330
 fighting system and gigantic 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.189
 spaceships whether the comparison to street 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.680
 fighter and team fortress but really 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 does not fit or dreadnought only 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.130
 world of warcraft with spaceships 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.160
 we are in an alpha version 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.290
 even viewed currently offers red dot 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.170
 two game modes team deathmatch and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 illumination but more on that later 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 in both modes, there are two five-team teams 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.910
 against each other 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 before it gets down to business, they collect 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.510
 fleets in a nice intro sequence 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.440
 and we have a pot 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.379
 choose 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 There are five classes to choose from 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 armored but immovable dreadnought 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.100
 the agile corvette the punchy one 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 destroyer of the televised 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.300
 specialized artillery cruiser and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.369
 the tactical cruiser with repair 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 jet in the finished game should pro 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.400
 ship class as well three 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.439
 different variants to choose 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 are the two weapons and four 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.470
 skills slots we also still free 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.619
 may equip 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.420
 in sum, makes a lot 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.490
 possibilities his personal 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.310
 favorite to find or tactical 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 to try angle pulls 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 our corvette has her for example 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.960
 a tan function on board with it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.579
 we creep unnoticed to you 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.350
 vulnerable enemy tactical 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.750
 cruiser and burn him out next 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 close only torpedo itself on the fur 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.869
 but later we start the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.640
 mistake us with our weak 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.110
 armored aviator in the middle of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 tumulting 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.850
 the broadside of a jet north shows us 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.729
 friendly but determined that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.380
 that was not too good an idea 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.790
 so each of the five classes will fulfill one 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.770
 very specific role on the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.720
 battlefield contrary to world of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.430
 Washington the team members as well 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 the possibility of your choice of class 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.990
 to agree and will not 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.060
 coincidentally heard together 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.649
 will enjoy well-coordinated teams 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.840
 tangible benefits 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.319
 the comparison to team fortress is so 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.420
 not too farfetched at all though 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.170
 street fighter ok let's look at the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.090
 fight 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.340
 basically will be completely normal with the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.000
 Mouse aimed and blared what the pipes 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.830
 give 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.260
 with the numeric keys we solve ours 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.330
 Special attacks from, for example, these 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.380
 extremely cool plasma frame of the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.209
 Destroyer over a circle menu 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.099
 apart from the additional energy we distribute 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 on our drive the weapon systems 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.080
 or catch the shields of clever players 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.269
 So for example in rocket soap with 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.950
 strengthened shields and then conduct 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.350
 the energy on the weapons around the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.200
 attackers for their part to give acid 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.870
 and if we turn three eyes 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.370
 then in this system are actually 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.230
 certain parallel to the mixture 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.239
 Attacks and blogs in a game of chance 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.580
 to recognize is decisive in the fight 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.080
 but also the right positioning 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.060
 Finally, we control the spaceships 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.170
 completely in all three dimensions 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.480
 can move freely 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.100
 to facilitate the orientation there 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.049
 but it is solid ground on every card 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.590
 structures that we use cleverly 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.180
 can 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.010
 Here, for example, we use the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.480
 environment as cover while the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.600
 tann coat our corvette again 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.880
 Charges thick carrier plate like the red 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.500
 dot align around its broadside into 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.780
 It is not even possible to aim 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.560
 so easy nimble attackers maneuver 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.109
 us simply from apropos nimble attacker 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.299
 in contrast to the team have deathmatch 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.130
 we only have one life in the elimination mode 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.900
 we have to break our ship 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.690
 but not stupid to look but 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.609
 put us in such little hunters the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.170
 Although hardly hits can but 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.200
 still delicate needle-sticks 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.720
 put your allied goals on display 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.859
 or serve as targets for warp jumps 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.470
 a nice idea 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.269
 Well and then we finally come 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.420
 still the greatest mutuality between 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.859
 dreadnought and world of warcraft both 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.260
 Games put on a free to play 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.000
 model like that at dreadnought exactly 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.049
 but the developers want to look like that 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.790
 not revealed yet 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.040
 but they promise that neither 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.170
 exaggerated branding still playful 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.239
 to give benefits for paid players 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.609
 unlike the street fighter 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.410
 But we have that all too well 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.120
 frequently 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.239
 look ma times 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.239
 hey
