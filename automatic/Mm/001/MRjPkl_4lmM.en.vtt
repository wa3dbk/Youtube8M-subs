thought about it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.500 
thought about it
maybe<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.170> tried<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.800> think<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.760> mean

I'm<00:00:21.660> an<00:00:21.750> average<00:00:21.930> guy<00:00:22.260> I'm<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:22.740> what<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I'm an average guy I'm not what you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.279 
I'm an average guy I'm not what you
consider<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> tree<00:00:23.910> hugger<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.810> try<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> be

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289

informed<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.980> try<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> right<00:00:26.609> thing<00:00:26.970> but

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
informed I try to do the right thing but

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
informed I try to do the right thing but
I<00:00:27.930> find<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> bit

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

I find that it can all be a bit
overwhelming<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.119> times<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.750> live<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.920> small

overwhelming at times I live in a small

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.459 
overwhelming at times I live in a small
town<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.610> Colorado<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.630> wasn't<00:00:33.989> until<00:00:34.230> my

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
town in Colorado and it wasn't until my

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440 
town in Colorado and it wasn't until my
town<00:00:34.800> challenged<00:00:35.610> another<00:00:35.850> town<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> few<00:00:36.390> hours

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
town challenged another town a few hours

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.660 
town challenged another town a few hours
away<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.320> who<00:00:37.530> could<00:00:37.710> reduce<00:00:38.070> their<00:00:38.370> use

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
away to see who could reduce their use

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
away to see who could reduce their use
of<00:00:38.700> plastic<00:00:39.390> bags<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.840> most<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.829> first

of plastic bags the most and I first
started<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.579> think<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:41.879> plastic<00:00:42.570> bags<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
started to think about plastic bags and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.950 
started to think about plastic bags and
what<00:00:43.260> we'd<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.600> mean<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.780> all

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
what we'd do with them I mean we all

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
what we'd do with them I mean we all
have<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> lot<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.410> bags<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:47.000> everybody<00:00:48.000> does

have a lot of bags right everybody does
the<00:00:48.329> same<00:00:48.360> thing<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.230> collect<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.829> shove

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the same thing we collect them we shove

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
the same thing we collect them we shove
them<00:00:50.370> anywhere<00:00:50.640> they'll<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.690> under<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
them anywhere they'll go like under the

a pile away every now and then just to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
a pile away every now and then just to
be<00:00:57.270> done<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.750> them<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> disposable

right<00:00:59.579> they<00:01:00.539> were<00:01:00.600> created<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.500> thrown

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
right they were created to be thrown

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.090 
right they were created to be thrown
away<00:01:02.870> but<00:01:03.870> let's<00:01:04.049> face<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> dirty

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
away but let's face it there's a dirty

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
away but let's face it there's a dirty
little<00:01:05.280> secret<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.850> even<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.689> won't

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
little secret here even if we won't

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590 
little secret here even if we won't
admit<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:08.909> plastic<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
admit it just because plastic is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.870 
admit it just because plastic is
disposable<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.890> doesn't<00:01:11.220> mean<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.670> goes

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
disposable it doesn't mean it just goes

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.820 
disposable it doesn't mean it just goes
away<00:01:12.409> after<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.820> where<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.799> there<00:01:16.799> is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
away after all where is a way there is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.140 
away after all where is a way there is
no<00:01:17.400> away<00:01:18.439> it<00:01:19.439> actually<00:01:19.920> sticks<00:01:20.220> around<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
no away it actually sticks around for a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.950 
no away it actually sticks around for a
really<00:01:21.810> long<00:01:22.170> time<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.659> me<00:01:24.780> thinking

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
really long time that got me thinking

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
really long time that got me thinking
about<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> endless<00:01:26.130> products<00:01:26.700> made<00:01:26.909> out

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
about all the endless products made out

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
about all the endless products made out
of<00:01:27.180> plastic<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> them<00:01:28.470> designed<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of plastic a lot of them designed to be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460 
of plastic a lot of them designed to be
used<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.340> less<00:01:29.670> than<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.119> day<00:01:30.329> impact<00:01:31.229> less

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
used for less than one day impact less

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.460 
used for less than one day impact less
than<00:01:31.650> 15<00:01:32.070> minutes<00:01:32.369> even<00:01:33.079> once<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.229> began

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
than 15 minutes even once I began

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
than 15 minutes even once I began
looking<00:01:34.770> around<00:01:35.040> pretty<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:35.790> everything

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
looking around pretty much everything

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.010 
looking around pretty much everything
seemed<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.049> made<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.590> plastic<00:01:38.900> but<00:01:39.900> all

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
seemed to be made of plastic but all

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.350 
seemed to be made of plastic but all
this<00:01:40.140> plastic<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.799> my<00:01:40.920> life<00:01:41.159> maybe<00:01:41.610> even<00:01:41.939> be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this plastic in my life maybe even be

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.260 
this plastic in my life maybe even be
bad<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.869> me<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.310> started<00:01:44.520> looking<00:01:44.759> into<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
bad for me so I started looking into it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.980 
bad for me so I started looking into it
the<00:01:45.600> way<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> doesn't<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.409> away

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
the way it doesn't go away

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.399 
the way it doesn't go away
the<00:01:47.830> way<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.130> pollutes<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.909> way<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.570> flies<00:01:49.930> and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
the way it pollutes the way it flies and

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.219 
the way it pollutes the way it flies and
floats<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.369> drifts<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.240> clogs<00:01:52.810> and
