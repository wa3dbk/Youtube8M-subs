your stuff and we'll hear from the
Russia<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.430> diving<00:00:35.700> school<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.750> speech

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Russia like in diving school like speech

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.570 
Russia like in diving school like speech
how<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> start<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> same<00:00:39.090> finish

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
how you start you have the same finish

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.790 
how you start you have the same finish
the<00:00:41.580> take-off<00:00:41.970> from<00:00:42.030> 27<00:00:42.809> meters<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> very

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the take-off from 27 meters is very

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.320 
the take-off from 27 meters is very
difficult<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.339> you<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.970> be<00:00:45.089> careful

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
difficult because you have to be careful

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.390 
difficult because you have to be careful
about<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.870> speed<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.589> some<00:00:46.860> guides<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
about the speed like some guides you

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.130 
about the speed like some guides you
need<00:00:47.580> to<00:00:47.670> throw<00:00:47.909> with<00:00:48.059> maximum<00:00:48.750> power<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
need to throw with maximum power and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
need to throw with maximum power and
some<00:00:49.350> dives<00:00:49.589> you<00:00:49.800> need<00:00:49.949> to<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.489> little

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
some dives you need to do it a little

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.670 
some dives you need to do it a little
bit<00:00:51.059> slower<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.540> show<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.750> lot<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.140> control<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
bit slower and show a lot of control but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.710 
bit slower and show a lot of control but
also<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.220> take-off<00:00:53.519> is<00:00:53.670> about<00:00:53.940> power<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
also the take-off is about power and

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.299 
also the take-off is about power and
that<00:00:54.839> comes<00:00:55.110> from<00:00:55.229> strength<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.920> speed

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that comes from strength and speed

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.399 
that comes from strength and speed
training<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.909> also<00:00:57.449> comes<00:00:57.839> from<00:00:57.900> technique

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
training and also comes from technique

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.810 
training and also comes from technique
trainings<00:00:58.800> there's<00:00:58.979> a<00:00:59.040> lot<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.250> interesting

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
trainings there's a lot of interesting

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.640 
trainings there's a lot of interesting
components<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.750> come<00:01:00.989> together<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.470> make<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
components they come together to make a

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.180 
components they come together to make a
powerful<00:01:02.339> take<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:06.590> like<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.620> back<00:01:07.860> take<00:01:08.070> off

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
powerful take up I like a back take off

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.580 
powerful take up I like a back take off
you<00:01:08.430> swing<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.909> arms<00:01:09.150> through<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.320> me<00:01:10.440> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you swing your arms through and for me a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.110 
you swing your arms through and for me a
very<00:01:10.650> important<00:01:11.400> part<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.880> bring

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
very important part is that you bring

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.520 
very important part is that you bring
your<00:01:12.240> arms<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.570> fully<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.290> still<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
your arms up fully and you're still a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
your arms up fully and you're still a
heart<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.190> apps<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.630> bend

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
heart on your apps so you don't bend

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.810 
heart on your apps so you don't bend
your<00:01:16.439> hip<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> front<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> gives<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
your hip to the front and that gives you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.820 
your hip to the front and that gives you
a<00:01:17.850> sloppy<00:01:18.149> rotation<00:01:18.750> backwards

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.250 

you<00:01:22.670> need<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.970> have<00:01:23.060> like<00:01:23.240> really<00:01:23.300> strong<00:01:23.840> legs

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
you need to have like really strong legs

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.490 
you need to have like really strong legs
to<00:01:24.740> push<00:01:25.430> really<00:01:25.850> hard<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.480> know<00:01:26.510> you<00:01:27.170> got<00:01:27.350> to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
to push really hard you know you got to

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500 
to push really hard you know you got to
get<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.740> body<00:01:27.950> moving<00:01:28.640> sometimes<00:01:29.270> like<00:01:29.420> when

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
get the body moving sometimes like when

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.970 
get the body moving sometimes like when
you<00:01:29.630> do<00:01:29.750> reverse<00:01:30.110> or<00:01:30.320> in<00:01:30.410> where<00:01:30.620> you're<00:01:30.770> moving

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
you do reverse or in where you're moving

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.470 
you do reverse or in where you're moving
away<00:01:31.250> from<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.790> platform<00:01:31.970> while<00:01:32.270> you're

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
away from the platform while you're

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.200 
away from the platform while you're
trying<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.900> spin<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.380> twist<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.220> if<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:35.090> got

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
trying to spin and twist so if you got

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.790 
trying to spin and twist so if you got
to<00:01:35.360> have<00:01:35.450> really<00:01:35.750> strong<00:01:35.960> legs<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.350> your<00:01:36.740> core

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
to have really strong legs and your core

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.100 
to have really strong legs and your core
like<00:01:37.310> your<00:01:37.430> stomach<00:01:37.640> has<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.180> able<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.510> lift

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
like your stomach has to be able to lift

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
like your stomach has to be able to lift
the<00:01:39.320> legs<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.770> get<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.190> body<00:01:40.370> moving

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the legs and get the body moving

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.240 
the legs and get the body moving
you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.850 

on<00:01:45.640> my<00:01:45.820> triple<00:01:46.240> quad<00:01:46.450> if<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:47.200> don't<00:01:47.410> get<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.650> good

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
on my triple quad if I don't get a good

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.710 
on my triple quad if I don't get a good
takeoff<00:01:48.280> there's<00:01:48.580> no<00:01:48.760> way<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:49.240> can<00:01:49.300> put<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
takeoff there's no way that I can put it

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.440 
takeoff there's no way that I can put it
into<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.990> water<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.680> get<00:01:50.890> straight<00:01:51.130> tens<00:01:51.460> it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
into the water and get straight tens it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.050 
into the water and get straight tens it
has<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.840> have<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> massive<00:01:53.560> powerful<00:01:54.250> jump<00:01:54.580> and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
has to have a massive powerful jump and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.300 
has to have a massive powerful jump and
I<00:01:55.120> have<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.420> get<00:01:55.600> into<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:55.990> twist<00:01:56.290> as<00:01:56.860> soon<00:01:57.130> as

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
I have to get into the twist as soon as

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.520 
I have to get into the twist as soon as
possible<00:01:57.850> with<00:01:58.300> as<00:01:58.420> much<00:01:58.600> rotation<00:01:59.170> as

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
possible with as much rotation as

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.430
