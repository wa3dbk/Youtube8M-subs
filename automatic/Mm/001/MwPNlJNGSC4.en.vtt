00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 so hello everyone today with you sergey and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 today we will repair the flash drive in 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.540
 her 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.660
 the usb and connector broke off and it doesn't work 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.350
 now we will analyze and try to go 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.350
 to mount 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.490
 first you need to remove 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.490
 iron case 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.420
 we have everything falling apart so removed 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:52.870
 Dad, we all fell apart all 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.870
 broke and get our fee 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.190
 so it can be seen 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.399
 we everywhere does he hang out 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.860
 you broke 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:20.040
 connectors so if these three 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.270
 the whole is in place here in the extreme from breaking 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.690
 and we need to solder them that we are now and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690
 will do 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.319
 so the soldering iron is hot here 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.390
 here is a piece of the board I returned the garden with another 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.460
 side left there for nenko 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.299
 solder our 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.299
 yusbi connector 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.810
 so align we have aligned well 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.860
 solder until it fails now 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.650
 try to remove from the board 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.880
 protective paint on top and enlarge 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.880
 soldering area 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.540
 so here I am here is cleared the paint 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.370
 protective paint on the board itself and to 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.819
 Our copper layer was visible and 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.680
 I will solder ours to her now 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.800
 pins and connectors because here 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.910
 here they are all broken together with the board and 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.910
 solder to nothing 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.050
 now on the other hand try 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.050
 understand 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:56.070
 I'm so fucked up 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.810
 here it was impossible to solder on both sides 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.330
 to the old contract that the fee was 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.030
 broken out in this place I cleaned 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.150
 neatly next to a screwdriver top 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:12.750
 paint and soldered to fresh connectors 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.450
 fresh surface and side by side and standing 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.970
 soldered on the other hand and as a result we have 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.230
 ceased to hang out flash drive 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:28.560
 hard and reacts to inclusion in 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:32.330
 computer now it will show here at 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.330
 cable beaten here flash drive 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:42.600
 connect and you can see that we have a flash drive 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:47.130
 starts blinking light all 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:51.860
 it did not work before that we are all now 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:55.130
 Glue it and glue it and the flash drive is ready 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.130
 future vein 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:00.149
 in general, all 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:02.879
 there you can give it to the owner of everything 

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:05.279
