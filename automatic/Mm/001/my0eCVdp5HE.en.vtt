00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.980
 good hello to everyone I am always yours 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.139
 and welcome back to jak and daxter e 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 here we are back at the time 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 then how is the last time I was 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 done like 12 hours of gameplay I had 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.740
 finished true type registration 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.529
 completely destroyed and I went to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.349
 talk to these people here is prejudice 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.110
 the first are protesting by exploring one 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.010
 mythical cave and full of a beautiful metal 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 orange and was very well hidden 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.920
 behind some trees in the mountains 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.309
 snowy 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.410
 I said it but he started shouting 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.989
 like a pact because I stopped 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 digging the problem is not so much that I have to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.260
 go there and find the trees e 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.969
 etc. etc. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.149
 the problem is that I have to do them 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.300
 uphill because it is so long 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.530
 then trees trees trees serve 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.479
 let's try to go up 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.040
 there is no half tree ergo here is not like 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.550
 I make incredible logical deductions 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.490
 top of the high snow mountain 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.100
 so gliding over the snow you give us 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.580
 hold on or the good yes I know that of 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:35.170
 here and here 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:38.640
 hello friend oh my God, but it's time for weapons 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 I can all do it 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.509
 oh yes 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.960
 of the party the machinery why 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.299
 the machinery started when it wasn't there 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.630
 plus the battery does not make sense this thing 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:11.720
 and how we go back not so and so 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:15.050
 all too comfortable so though boy fin 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.450
 too little not again things that yes 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.340
 move but come on 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:31.250
 i need one thing to do for 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:34.030
 hold on to the ace clinging to the harken 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:41.090
 I don't think I think anyone's there 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:45.650
 we can carefully die 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.209
 how nice that I had even managed to 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:58.440
 who the straight corridor cannot manage to 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:03:01.950
 hit from the ok then I did it 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.800
 but has not yet found the cave of 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.130
 shit can be the trees here 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.130
 these 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:21.580
 no okay it's worse it is worse than the levels 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:23.730
 of bandicoot crashes here on others all 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.730
 wet 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.370
 but all wet and the things that we 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.050
 they should actually kill me not 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:43.620
 they do more or less nothing 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:44.750
 no look look look look i knew it 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.890

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.720
 ok well guys then i still don't have 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.790

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.020
 but let's say we did for today 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.310
