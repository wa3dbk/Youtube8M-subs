affinity for a link but that still isn't
much<00:05:25.530> lastly<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.710> that<00:05:26.919> Navi<00:05:27.310> may<00:05:27.460> have

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
much lastly is that Navi may have

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.370 
much lastly is that Navi may have
ascended<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:28.060> heaven<00:05:28.210> or<00:05:28.600> to<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.050> afterlife
