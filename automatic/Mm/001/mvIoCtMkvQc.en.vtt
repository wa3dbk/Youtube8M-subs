00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the architect clÃ¡udia sovierzoski with a 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.680
 specialist in bars and restaurants 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 is back in our program for this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.420
 to show project details 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.420
 of pizzeria carola see how cool 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.529
 We are in the cabal carola. 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.080
 This is another project of ours. 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.269
 architecture office antwerp 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 where we have a concept of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.619
 Italian restaurant as it already 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 There is no bistro in this restaurant. 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.770
 the same project to the same project 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.559
 same usual concept where a restaurant 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.590
 we left it cozy where 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.559
 we have here an apparent pizza oven 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.460
 all furniture is more furniture 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.469
 dark a furniture that brings a certain 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.399
 comfort we use here the colors 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.760
 warm colors in red tones 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.219
 the standard is a brown floor is one more floor 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 dark a standard embu and just like everything 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.060
 the furniture as the tables chairs 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.659
 we also use a hydraulic tile 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.439
 to bring a little of itself is more reason 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.170
 as the facade of the house leads to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.229
 this older pattern for tying 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.720
 chada is very italian in the restaurant we 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.540
 we made an entrance hall so that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.150
 had some privacy between the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.979
 part of the restaurant the tables and entrance 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.159
 of people who stayed up in the sphere 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.500
 then yes we have a floor a carpet 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 hydraulic tile with a central table 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 so that your is well lit 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.869
 also highly centralized 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.380
 including facing the oven, which is the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.990
 most important reason for this restaurant 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.149
 this is location here and the furniture we 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 we put all the same round tables 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.310
 square tables we have tiles 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.100
 in each center in the center of the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.299
 table to give a colorful 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.460
 differentiated from the restaurant so that 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.960
 people can leave a little more joy 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.740
 but always using colors 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.140
 hot 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.380
 the oven is the centerpiece of the restaurant 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.390
 the oven is a more important place there 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.420
 where they make the tapes when you 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.069
 get here it's done there in front of you 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.049
 oven so that we leave the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.940
 well-known oven with a 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.730
 very Italian trait even with 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.830
 brick is the bottom of the appliance in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.709
 red with these warm colors 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.130
 the decor the bar part the bottles 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.049
 appearing the cartons of the bottles also 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.930
 we have the cellar that is a very drug 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.870
 where we have a wine cellar and 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.239
 same time the exposure of these wines 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.030
 so here at the counter really we 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.280
 we put something else is an entire counter 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.130
 that is where the preparation of the pizza has 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.220
 to be made of white stone and 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.109
 we can measure more we can 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.209
 to carry out a project where we have 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.340
 this diversity of materials at the same 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.230
 time has its own style and lighting 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.260
 for this type of restaurant he should 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.850
 be very well thought of should the technician 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.579
 be very well done 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.220
 we use here a mixture of lighting 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.859
 with led and at the same time with stores with 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.630
 lighting warm colors why is this 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.880
 that brings comfort is what brings the 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.590
 well being the heating of the restaurant 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.260
 restaurant where you have a 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.640
 hot pizza oven then we have 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:31.830
 that bring that yellow color in 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:33.870
 if the environment of this restaurant is 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.850
 environment where we produce is 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.020
 really that human heat of the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.560
 Italian 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.430
 the tables with several seats to a hall 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.650
 not only has divisions in this room is you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.390
 can join several tables also if 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.390
 come with large groups of people 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.989
 can not join and has a number 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.810
 appropriate for each profile for each 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.239
 and what we see here also 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.190
 that we put and think a lot here 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.680
 this restaurant was the question of 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.410
 so we have some 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.900
 Atmosphere here is very enjoyable. 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.150
 people feel good in here 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.890
 a view to the street also then to 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.799
 person who feels that people do not 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.500
 feel trapped in those days already 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.900
 has a good external view and at the same time 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.790
 during the day is a restaurant 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.669
 very light and airy. 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.900
 environment that we produce so that 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.900
 customers were satisfied 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.310
