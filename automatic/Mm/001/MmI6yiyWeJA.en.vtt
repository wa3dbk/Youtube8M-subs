00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.149 

so<00:02:28.219> yeah<00:02:28.400> when<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.909> starts<00:02:29.480> up<00:02:29.659> it<00:02:30.049> does<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
so yeah when it starts up it does the

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.420 
so yeah when it starts up it does the
bounce<00:02:31.370> Idol<00:02:31.879> between<00:02:32.359> about<00:02:32.629> 1,500<00:02:33.500> rpms<00:02:34.010> to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
bounce Idol between about 1,500 rpms to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.780 
bounce Idol between about 1,500 rpms to
about<00:02:34.790> 2,500<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.139> then<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.040> barely<00:02:37.340> touch<00:02:37.760> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
about 2,500 and then I barely touch the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.729 
about 2,500 and then I barely touch the
throttle<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.569> it<00:02:38.719> goes<00:02:38.900> up<00:02:39.109> and<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.409> starts

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
throttle and it goes up and it starts

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.300 
throttle and it goes up and it starts
out<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.069> like<00:02:40.250> three<00:02:41.239> ground<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.010> then<00:02:43.010> as

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
out of like three ground and then as

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.839 
out of like three ground and then as
soon<00:02:43.489> as<00:02:43.639> I<00:02:43.730> rev<00:02:43.969> it<00:02:44.150> up<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.599> drops<00:02:44.900> back<00:02:45.169> down

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
soon as I rev it up it drops back down

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.360 
soon as I rev it up it drops back down
so<00:02:46.849> I<00:02:47.569> don't<00:02:48.169> know<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.439> engine<00:02:48.769> seems<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.189> get

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
so I don't know the engine seems to get

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.099 
so I don't know the engine seems to get
hot<00:02:49.579> i<00:02:51.250> don't<00:02:52.250> i<00:02:52.599> don't<00:02:53.599> think<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
hot i don't i don't think the

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.420 
hot i don't i don't think the
thermostats<00:02:54.709> opening<00:02:55.189> maybe<00:02:55.430> um<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:58.310> know

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
thermostats opening maybe um you know

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.610 
thermostats opening maybe um you know
like<00:02:59.359> i<00:02:59.510> said<00:02:59.780> i<00:02:59.810> don't<00:03:00.019> know<00:03:00.139> if<00:03:00.349> all<00:03:00.469> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
like i said i don't know if all the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.899 
like i said i don't know if all the
vacuum<00:03:01.010> lines<00:03:01.250> are<00:03:01.489> correct<00:03:01.819> i<00:03:02.030> don't<00:03:02.209> know<00:03:02.329> if

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
vacuum lines are correct i don't know if

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.089 
vacuum lines are correct i don't know if
the<00:03:04.909> ECU<00:03:05.510> i<00:03:05.540> got<00:03:05.989> two<00:03:06.199> wires<00:03:06.439> that<00:03:06.739> could<00:03:06.980> be

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
the ECU i got two wires that could be

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.369 
the ECU i got two wires that could be
wrong<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.699> plus<00:03:08.269> B<00:03:08.540> 1<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:10.719> negative<00:03:11.719> V<00:03:12.169> 1<00:03:12.349> I

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
wrong the plus B 1 and negative V 1 I

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.939 
wrong the plus B 1 and negative V 1 I
think<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.889> is<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.340> pin<00:03:13.849> 1<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.329> 9<00:03:14.510> on<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.409> 16

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
think it is the pin 1 and 9 on the 16

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.530 
think it is the pin 1 and 9 on the 16
pin<00:03:16.599> could<00:03:17.599> be<00:03:17.719> crossed<00:03:18.819> but<00:03:19.819> yeah<00:03:20.269> that's

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
pin could be crossed but yeah that's

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.479 
pin could be crossed but yeah that's
about<00:03:20.659> it<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.989> don't<00:03:21.319> know<00:03:21.379> what<00:03:21.769> could<00:03:21.979> be<00:03:22.159> I

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
about it I don't know what could be I

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.710 
about it I don't know what could be I
got<00:03:23.449> I<00:03:23.949> just<00:03:24.949> tried<00:03:25.189> swapping<00:03:25.489> over<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:26.209> check

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
got I just tried swapping over the check

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.979 
got I just tried swapping over the check
valve<00:03:26.989> on<00:03:27.229> the<00:03:27.259> map<00:03:27.590> Center<00:03:28.069> no<00:03:28.310> change<00:03:28.870> if<00:03:29.870> i

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
valve on the map Center no change if i

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.770 
valve on the map Center no change if i
unplug<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:31.040> map<00:03:31.250> center<00:03:31.759> line<00:03:32.239> from<00:03:32.629> the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
unplug the map center line from the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.530 
unplug the map center line from the
throttle<00:03:33.409> intake<00:03:34.280> manifold<00:03:34.879> it<00:03:35.030> seems<00:03:35.299> to

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
throttle intake manifold it seems to

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.999 
throttle intake manifold it seems to
change<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.560> idol<00:03:36.889> a<00:03:37.009> bit<00:03:38.560> there's<00:03:39.560> some<00:03:39.799> stuff

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:40.009 
change the idol a bit there's some stuff

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:41.949 
change the idol a bit there's some stuff
I<00:03:40.189> did<00:03:40.370> cap<00:03:40.609> off<00:03:40.879> on<00:03:41.180> like<00:03:41.479> the<00:03:41.720> boost

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
I did cap off on like the boost

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.890 
I did cap off on like the boost
controller<00:03:42.560> side<00:03:42.979> of<00:03:43.159> the<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.849> vsv<00:03:44.150> vacuum

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
controller side of the the vsv vacuum

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.030 
controller side of the the vsv vacuum
switching<00:03:45.290> valve<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:47.120> boost<00:03:47.359> controller<00:03:48.040> one

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
switching valve the boost controller one

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
switching valve the boost controller one
that's<00:03:49.370> blue<00:03:49.729> I<00:03:50.169> capped<00:03:51.169> off<00:03:51.349> one<00:03:51.759> so<00:03:52.759> I<00:03:52.819> didn't

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
that's blue I capped off one so I didn't

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.689 
that's blue I capped off one so I didn't
know<00:03:53.120> where<00:03:53.299> that<00:03:53.329> went<00:03:53.659> and<00:03:54.019> then<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:55.519> other

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
know where that went and then the other

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.030 
know where that went and then the other
one<00:03:55.790> where<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.449> see<00:03:57.319> it's<00:03:57.530> hard<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.799> see<00:03:58.009> I

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
one where the see it's hard to see I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.219 
one where the see it's hard to see I
gotta<00:03:58.370> get<00:03:58.519> some<00:03:58.579> light<00:03:58.939> but<00:03:59.239> on<00:04:00.199> my<00:04:00.439> vs<00:04:00.769> beazer

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 
gotta get some light but on my vs beazer

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:08.709 
gotta get some light but on my vs beazer
done<00:04:04.359> down<00:04:05.359> here<00:04:06.519> yeah<00:04:07.519> I<00:04:07.819> think<00:04:08.389> it<00:04:08.540> some<00:04:08.659> more

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:08.719 
done down here yeah I think it some more

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:14.469 
done down here yeah I think it some more
night<00:04:09.019> anyways<00:04:10.209> stay<00:04:11.209> tuned<00:04:11.540> for<00:04:12.229> more
