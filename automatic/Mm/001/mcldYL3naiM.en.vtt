you guys left alike as well as a comment
alright<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:50.739> glitch<00:00:50.980> all<00:00:51.159> you<00:00:51.760> need

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
alright so to this glitch all you need

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.490 
alright so to this glitch all you need
to<00:00:51.940> do<00:00:52.180> simply<00:00:52.420> get<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.600> ballistic<00:00:52.960> vest<00:00:53.199> or<00:00:53.379> an

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
to do simply get a ballistic vest or an

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.170 
to do simply get a ballistic vest or an
ammo<00:00:53.649> crate<00:00:53.980> they're<00:00:54.430> both<00:00:54.670> support

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
ammo crate they're both support

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.119 
ammo crate they're both support
killstreaks<00:00:55.390> which<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.409> good<00:00:56.589> so<00:00:56.829> that<00:00:56.949> means

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
killstreaks which is good so that means

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.619 
killstreaks which is good so that means
if<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.339> die<00:00:57.460> couple<00:00:57.790> times<00:00:58.000> while<00:00:58.239> trying<00:00:58.510> to

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
if you die couple times while trying to

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.450 
if you die couple times while trying to
do<00:00:58.719> is<00:00:58.809> glitch<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.649> know<00:00:59.800> you<00:01:00.070> won't<00:01:00.190> have<00:01:00.399> to

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
do is glitch you know you won't have to

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.830 
do is glitch you know you won't have to
work<00:01:00.609> harder<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.000> get<00:01:01.180> those<00:01:01.329> kill<00:01:01.570> streaks

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
work harder to get those kill streaks

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.660 
work harder to get those kill streaks
and<00:01:02.019> i<00:01:02.769> would<00:01:02.980> recommend<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.430> having

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
and i would recommend you having

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.580 
and i would recommend you having
concussion<00:01:04.119> but<00:01:04.539> you<00:01:04.690> can<00:01:04.869> have<00:01:05.019> an<00:01:05.110> explosive

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
concussion but you can have an explosive

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.410 
concussion but you can have an explosive
such<00:01:05.770> as<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.979> grenade<00:01:06.280> but<00:01:06.850> obviously<00:01:07.240> you'll

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
such as the grenade but obviously you'll

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.330 
such as the grenade but obviously you'll
take<00:01:07.600> some<00:01:07.750> damage<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:08.710> once<00:01:09.009> you're<00:01:09.220> on<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
take some damage so once you're on the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.520 
take some damage so once you're on the
map<00:01:09.580> freight<00:01:09.970> all<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.810> need<00:01:10.899> to<00:01:10.929> do<00:01:11.080> simply<00:01:11.380> go

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
map freight all you need to do simply go

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.320 
map freight all you need to do simply go
to<00:01:11.560> this<00:01:11.679> lower<00:01:11.860> part<00:01:12.130> of<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.250> map<00:01:12.490> where<00:01:13.179> the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
to this lower part of the map where the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.359 
to this lower part of the map where the
stairs<00:01:13.570> are<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.530> gate<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.740> open<00:01:15.220> you

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
stairs are and if the gate is open you

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.310 
stairs are and if the gate is open you
can<00:01:15.399> add<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.729> this<00:01:15.850> glitch<00:01:16.090> so<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.720> gate<00:01:16.929> must

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
can add to this glitch so the gate must

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.070 
can add to this glitch so the gate must
be<00:01:17.649> shot<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.729> must<00:01:19.030> be<00:01:19.270> where<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.840> stairs

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
be shot and you must be where the stairs

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
be shot and you must be where the stairs
are<00:01:20.289> you<00:01:20.710> can't<00:01:21.009> be<00:01:21.130> in<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.280> opposite<00:01:21.580> side

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
are you can't be in the opposite side

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.840 
are you can't be in the opposite side
alright<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.470> once<00:01:24.039> you<00:01:24.190> have<00:01:24.310> either<00:01:24.550> one<00:01:24.789> of

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
alright so once you have either one of

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.460 
alright so once you have either one of
those<00:01:25.000> killstreaks<00:01:25.600> all<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.170> want<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.409> do

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
those killstreaks all you want to do

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.380 
those killstreaks all you want to do
with<00:01:26.649> you<00:01:26.830> where<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.070> stairs<00:01:27.340> are<00:01:27.550> at<00:01:27.759> pay

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
with you where the stairs are at pay

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.270 
with you where the stairs are at pay
attention<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.020> where<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.229> put<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.679> ammo<00:01:30.009> crate

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
attention to where I put the ammo crate

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.070 
attention to where I put the ammo crate
in<00:01:30.459> the<00:01:30.550> ballistic<00:01:30.880> vest<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.239> show<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.479> both<00:01:31.840> in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
in the ballistic vest I show it both in

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.589 
in the ballistic vest I show it both in
the<00:01:32.259> video<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.670> want<00:01:33.849> to<00:01:33.940> throw<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.270> on<00:01:34.390> the

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:34.599 
the video so you want to throw it on the

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.740 
the video so you want to throw it on the
horizontal<00:01:35.500> part<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.610> gate<00:01:36.819> and<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
horizontal part of the gate and the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.690 
horizontal part of the gate and the
further<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.349> ammo<00:01:38.530> crate<00:01:38.920> or<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.340> ballistic

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
further the ammo crate or the ballistic

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.400 
further the ammo crate or the ballistic
vest<00:01:39.910> is<00:01:40.090> towards<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.599> right<00:01:40.810> part<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.349> the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
vest is towards the right part of the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.219 
vest is towards the right part of the
gate<00:01:41.739> and<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.670> wall<00:01:42.910> like<00:01:43.539> it<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.989> in<00:01:44.140> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
gate and the wall like it is in the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.080 
gate and the wall like it is in the
video<00:01:44.349> the<00:01:45.099> more<00:01:45.310> likely<00:01:45.700> you'll<00:01:45.849> get<00:01:45.970> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
video the more likely you'll get the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.850 
video the more likely you'll get the
glitch<00:01:46.660> if<00:01:47.050> you<00:01:47.319> don't<00:01:47.500> do<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.739> glitch

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
glitch if you don't do the glitch

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.219 
glitch if you don't do the glitch
correctly<00:01:48.459> you'll<00:01:49.030> be<00:01:49.119> halfway<00:01:49.630> under<00:01:50.020> the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
correctly you'll be halfway under the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.469 
correctly you'll be halfway under the
map<00:01:50.440> and<00:01:50.770> it's<00:01:51.459> pretty<00:01:51.700> it's<00:01:52.030> still<00:01:52.300> pretty

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
map and it's pretty it's still pretty

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.199 
map and it's pretty it's still pretty
good<00:01:52.810> as<00:01:52.959> a<00:01:53.020> glitch<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.830> just<00:01:54.009> can't<00:01:54.220> move<00:01:54.489> but

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
good as a glitch you just can't move but

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.510 
good as a glitch you just can't move but
if<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:55.660> do<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.899> glitch<00:01:56.020> correctly<00:01:56.619> you'll<00:01:57.340> be

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
if you do the glitch correctly you'll be

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.779 
if you do the glitch correctly you'll be

to do somebody just hold X and what
should<00:02:23.260> happen<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.980> gate<00:02:24.190> will<00:02:24.340> open<00:02:24.370> and

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
should happen is the gate will open and

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.910 
should happen is the gate will open and
while<00:02:25.390> you're<00:02:25.510> holding<00:02:25.629> x<00:02:25.959> one<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.769> gets

opens you should either be stuck if you

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.130 
opens you should either be stuck if you
do<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.580> glitch<00:02:30.700> incorrectly<00:02:31.239> or<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.930> should

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
do the glitch incorrectly or you should

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.930 
do the glitch incorrectly or you should
be<00:02:32.230> fully<00:02:32.500> under<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.860> map<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.760> there

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
be fully under the map and is there

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.580 
be fully under the map and is there
really<00:02:34.000> good<00:02:34.420> glitch<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:35.350> online<00:02:35.710> and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
really good glitch for online and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.869 
really good glitch for online and
you<00:02:36.680> know<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.830> can<00:02:37.040> do<00:02:37.129> some<00:02:37.340> trolling<00:02:37.730> and

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
you know you can do some trolling and

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.940 
you know you can do some trolling and
private<00:02:38.360> matches<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.410> really<00:02:39.739> cool

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
private matches this is a really cool

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.580 
private matches this is a really cool
and<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.310> guess<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.849> very<00:02:41.269> easy<00:02:41.540> glitch<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.379> do<00:02:42.470> in

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
and I guess a very easy glitch to do in

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.410 
and I guess a very easy glitch to do in
solo<00:02:42.950> as<00:02:43.129> you<00:02:43.489> know<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.879> just<00:02:43.970> need<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.209> get<00:02:44.300> an

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
solo as you know you just need to get an

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.390 
solo as you know you just need to get an
ammo<00:02:44.569> crate<00:02:44.930> or<00:02:45.379> ballistic<00:02:45.739> match<00:02:46.040> was<00:02:46.310> it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
ammo crate or ballistic match was it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.820 
ammo crate or ballistic match was it
about<00:02:46.550> like<00:02:46.730> six<00:02:47.000> or<00:02:47.269> seven<00:02:47.480> kills<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.470> long<00:02:48.650> as

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
about like six or seven kills so long as

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.920 
about like six or seven kills so long as
no<00:02:48.950> one<00:02:48.980> breaks<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.459> gate<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:50.420> pretty<00:02:50.750> much

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
no one breaks the gate it's pretty much

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.809 
no one breaks the gate it's pretty much
a<00:02:50.989> very<00:02:51.290> self-explanatory<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.280> very<00:02:52.580> easy

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
a very self-explanatory and very easy

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.059 
a very self-explanatory and very easy
glitch<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.870> once<00:02:54.260> again<00:02:54.410> would<00:02:54.769> greatly

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
glitch so I once again would greatly

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.740 
glitch so I once again would greatly
appreciate<00:02:55.280> if<00:02:55.849> you<00:02:56.000> guys<00:02:56.120> let<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:56.569> in
