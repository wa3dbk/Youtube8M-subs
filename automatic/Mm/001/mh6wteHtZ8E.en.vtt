we're going to let all of that dry and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.949 
we're going to let all of that dry and
then<00:03:30.260> we'll<00:03:30.380> come<00:03:30.560> back<00:03:30.709> in<00:03:30.739> with<00:03:31.010> our<00:03:31.069> scales

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
then we'll come back in with our scales

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.240 
then we'll come back in with our scales
all<00:03:32.959> right<00:03:33.079> that's<00:03:33.230> pretty<00:03:33.560> dry<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.040> I'm<00:03:34.100> going

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
all right that's pretty dry so I'm going

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.160 
all right that's pretty dry so I'm going
to<00:03:34.280> get<00:03:34.400> ready<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.760> draw<00:03:34.940> my<00:03:35.090> scales<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.630> I'm

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
to get ready to draw my scales and I'm

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.110 
to get ready to draw my scales and I'm
starting<00:03:36.470> mine<00:03:36.799> down<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.700> part<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.060> the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
starting mine down here this part of the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.000 
starting mine down here this part of the
nail<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:38.900> I'm<00:03:39.019> basically<00:03:39.170> just<00:03:39.470> going<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:39.889> do

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
nail so I'm basically just going to do

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.229 
nail so I'm basically just going to do
little<00:03:40.220> half<00:03:40.549> circles<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:43.459> just<00:03:43.670> draw<00:03:43.910> those

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
little half circles and just draw those

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:53.190 
little half circles and just draw those
on<00:03:44.569> so<00:03:45.500> there's<00:03:45.680> my<00:03:45.829> first<00:03:46.099> one

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.050 

and<00:03:54.200> we're<00:03:54.410> just<00:03:54.590> kind<00:03:54.830> of<00:03:54.920> overlapping<00:03:55.610> those

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
and we're just kind of overlapping those

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.940 
and we're just kind of overlapping those
I'm<00:03:56.930> going<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.140> do<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.260> couple<00:03:57.470> more<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.800> then

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
I'm going to show you how to do the same

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.870 
I'm going to show you how to do the same
thing<00:03:59.390> with<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.569> other<00:03:59.690> tools<00:04:03.520> all<00:04:04.520> right<00:04:04.670> so

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
thing with the other tools all right so

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.100 
thing with the other tools all right so
you<00:04:04.970> know<00:04:05.150> my<00:04:05.270> polish<00:04:05.600> was<00:04:05.780> still<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:05.990> little

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you know my polish was still a little

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.809 
you know my polish was still a little
bit<00:04:06.440> wet<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:06.950> we're<00:04:07.250> going<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.459> work<00:04:07.550> on<00:04:07.730> the

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
bit wet so we're going to work on the

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.760 
bit wet so we're going to work on the
eye<00:04:07.850> instead<00:04:08.480> I've<00:04:09.050> got<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> little<00:04:09.560> bit<00:04:09.740> of

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
eye instead I've got a little bit of

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.830 
eye instead I've got a little bit of
white<00:04:09.950> developed<00:04:10.400> here<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:11.420> I'm<00:04:11.510> going<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.690> go

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
white developed here and I'm going to go

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.770 
white developed here and I'm going to go
in<00:04:12.080> now<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.770> I'm<00:04:12.890> going<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.190> do<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.430> dot<00:04:13.780> leaving

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
in now and I'm going to do a dot leaving

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.659 
in now and I'm going to do a dot leaving
some<00:04:15.020> of<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> blue<00:04:15.500> showing<00:04:15.830> now<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.370> more<00:04:16.579> at

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
some of the blue showing now so more at

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.030 
some of the blue showing now so more at
the<00:04:16.790> base<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.269> eye<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.720> just<00:04:17.950> start<00:04:18.950> it

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
the base of the eye and just start it

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.190 
the base of the eye and just start it
down<00:04:19.220> like<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.549> when<00:04:20.450> that<00:04:20.480> dries<00:04:20.780> we'll<00:04:20.989> add

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
down like that when that dries we'll add

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.010 
down like that when that dries we'll add
a<00:04:21.230> black<00:04:21.739> pupil<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.090> started<00:04:23.660> doing<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
a black pupil so I started doing the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.630 
a black pupil so I started doing the
scales<00:04:24.350> on<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.800> finger<00:04:25.040> with<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.310> striper

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
scales on this finger with a striper

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.220 
scales on this finger with a striper
again<00:04:26.000> just<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.240> show<00:04:26.480> you<00:04:26.510> your<00:04:26.870> different

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
again just to show you your different

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.270 
again just to show you your different
options<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.550> I've<00:04:28.910> got<00:04:29.120> my<00:04:29.150> polish<00:04:30.040> on<00:04:31.040> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
options so I've got my polish on the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.430 
options so I've got my polish on the
striper<00:04:31.550> ready<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.000> go<00:04:32.120> like<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.660> you're

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
striper ready to go like this and you're

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.150 
striper ready to go like this and you're
just<00:04:33.590> going<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:33.980> take<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:35.919> again<00:04:36.919> make

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
just going to take it and again make

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:46.840 
just going to take it and again make
those<00:04:37.370> Halfmoon<00:04:40.270> shapes<00:04:41.270> just<00:04:45.850> overlapping

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
those Halfmoon shapes just overlapping

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.190 
those Halfmoon shapes just overlapping
like<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.450> don't<00:04:47.600> worry<00:04:47.750> if<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:47.960> gets<00:04:48.110> on

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
like that and don't worry if it gets on

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.640 
like that and don't worry if it gets on
your<00:04:48.260> skin<00:04:48.380> we<00:04:48.740> can<00:04:48.770> clean<00:04:49.130> this<00:04:49.280> up<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:53.660> I

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
your skin we can clean this up and I

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.950 
your skin we can clean this up and I
like<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.010> move<00:04:55.160> my<00:04:55.370> hand<00:04:55.640> around<00:04:55.790> just<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.660> get

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
like to move my hand around just to get

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.360 
like to move my hand around just to get
you<00:04:57.590> know<00:04:57.680> better<00:04:57.919> angles<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.840> all<00:05:00.800> right<00:05:01.100> so

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
you know better angles and all right so

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.659 
you know better angles and all right so
I'm<00:05:01.400> continuing<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.450> add<00:05:03.220> scales<00:05:04.220> with<00:05:04.520> my

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
I'm continuing to add scales with my

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.700 
I'm continuing to add scales with my
striper<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:05.330> changed<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.840> angle<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.350> hopefully

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
striper I changed the angle so hopefully

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.920 
striper I changed the angle so hopefully
you<00:05:06.830> could<00:05:06.979> see<00:05:07.220> better<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:08.360> I'm<00:05:08.450> just<00:05:08.630> kind<00:05:08.780> of

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
you could see better so I'm just kind of

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.380 
you could see better so I'm just kind of
making<00:05:09.169> these<00:05:09.470> scalloped<00:05:10.130> or<00:05:10.430> half<00:05:10.880> circle

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
making these scalloped or half circle

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.890 
making these scalloped or half circle
shapes<00:05:11.720> just<00:05:15.400> in<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.490> pattern<00:05:16.700> on<00:05:17.030> my<00:05:17.240> nail<00:05:17.450> kind

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
shapes just in a pattern on my nail kind

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.230 
shapes just in a pattern on my nail kind
of<00:05:17.990> overlapping<00:05:18.470> like<00:05:18.860> that<00:05:19.100> so<00:05:19.880> that's<00:05:20.030> how

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
of overlapping like that so that's how

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.090 
of overlapping like that so that's how
the<00:05:20.270> striper<00:05:20.630> works<00:05:21.220> again<00:05:22.220> this<00:05:22.520> is<00:05:22.729> how<00:05:23.030> the

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
the striper works again this is how the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.270 
the striper works again this is how the
marker<00:05:25.100> works<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.550> literally<00:05:25.820> just<00:05:26.240> draw

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
marker works you literally just draw

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.230 
marker works you literally just draw
half<00:05:28.280> circles<00:05:28.760> on<00:05:28.970> there<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:30.910> if<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.030> had<00:05:32.210> a

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
half circles on there and if you had a

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.659 
half circles on there and if you had a
dotting<00:05:32.660> tool<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:33.860> would<00:05:34.010> just<00:05:34.130> dip<00:05:34.370> it<00:05:34.400> into

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
dotting tool you would just dip it into

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.940 
dotting tool you would just dip it into
your<00:05:34.910> polish<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.720> get<00:05:35.930> my<00:05:36.050> smallest<00:05:36.380> dotting

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
your polish you get my smallest dotting

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.860 
your polish you get my smallest dotting
tool<00:05:37.340> oh<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.930> was<00:05:39.110> my<00:05:39.289> smallest<00:05:40.570> dip<00:05:41.570> it<00:05:41.720> into

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
tool oh that was my smallest dip it into

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
like it's nice because they don't have

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.590
