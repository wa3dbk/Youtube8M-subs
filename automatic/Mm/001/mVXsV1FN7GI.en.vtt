00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.850
 Photoshop video tutorials 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.529
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.689
 Alexey Kuzmichyov 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.630
 and today we will have a little lesson for 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.210
 beginners whom i will show how to create 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.480
 simple effect called fish oh 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.099
 or in a different way the fisheye essence of this 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.070
 The effect is that we will 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.059
 from ordinary photos 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.559
 imitate the picture taken and us 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.460
 special lens fishay 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.460
 resulting in an image 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.870
 as if slightly convex on us and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.780
 This effect looks very interesting. 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.390
 Now you yourself clearly see this 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.879
 so first let's duplicate 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.789
 our main layer on the click combination 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.190
 control jay on the keyboard or you can 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.469
 right click on our layer 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 and select duplicate here. 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.630
 layer as you prefer and now let's 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.659
 let's go directly to create 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.140
 the effect itself 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.810
 create in several ways photoshop 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.310
 let's look at the first way for 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.640
 this we just press the combination 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.440
 control t on the keyboard either go to 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.290
 edit point free 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.100
 transform and click here 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.400
 right click and select item 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.230
 deformation after that we turn on 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.140
 the very top and here we have here such 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.690
 Here is a drop-down list in which we choose 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.340
 fish eye 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.830
 as you can see we have an image right away 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 is deformed and acquires such 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.530
 here is a convex shape this effect can be 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 use but I don't like it very much 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.080
 I prefer to do this effect with 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.170
 help another way let me give it to you 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.220
 also show here I will not save 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.330
 just press the escape key and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.030
 image returns to original 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.539
 I prefer to use 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.660
 filter distortion correction go 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.780
 this tool 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.720
 go to the custom tab here with us 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.239
 at the very top there is a geometric point 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.730
 distortion if we drag 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.350
 slider to the left of the images we have 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.290
 will be 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.430
 acquire such a convex shape 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.130
 if we drag the slider into 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.310
 the right side is the opposite image 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.700
 will be as if pressed in like 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.490
 see in this case we need an effect 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.040
 fisheye therefore 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.250
 Exhibiting about such settings 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.400
 put here minus 20 and also with 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.560
 perspective sliders we can change 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.480
 distortion of our photo we can 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.760
 make it a little bit stronger like 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.770
 see and also can a little bit 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.400
 expand image to 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:11.980
 example in this case, the headlight turned 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.380
 the middle of our effect is up to about here 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.560
 so I like the most you can 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.570
 leave and to enhance our 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.320
 result can even be added here 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.730
 for example vignette 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.450
 just drag the sliders 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.270
 effect to the left and the middle point can 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.320
 also slightly hold left as a result 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.610
 get here is such effect of seeing 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.600
 press ok to save it 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:44.140
 and let's look at the result as 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.000
 see before and after here is such a simple 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.880
 way to help you quickly and easily 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.600
 add effect to your any 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.500
 photograph 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.570
