I<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:40.980> can't<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.400> see<00:03:41.519> its<00:03:41.850> my

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
I know you can't really see its my

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.800 
I know you can't really see its my

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
lot of protein and hamsters need protein

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.849 
lot of protein and hamsters need protein
so<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.630> yet<00:03:48.810> they'll<00:03:48.989> also<00:03:49.170> eat<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.769> the

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
so and yet they'll also eat this in the

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.410 
so and yet they'll also eat this in the
wild<00:03:50.160> sometimes<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.000> come<00:03:51.180> across

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
wild sometimes like if they come across

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.129 
wild sometimes like if they come across
bug<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.019> that's<00:03:52.200> good<00:03:52.620> too<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:54.630> we'll<00:03:54.750> put<00:03:54.900> two

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
bug so that's good too so we'll put two

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.530 
bug so that's good too so we'll put two
of<00:03:55.260> those<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.440> there<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:57.060> can't<00:03:57.269> really<00:03:57.389> see

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
of those in there you can't really see

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.050 
of those in there you can't really see
them<00:03:57.750> because<00:03:57.900> they're<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.200> tiny<00:03:58.639> well<00:03:59.639> some

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
them because they're so tiny well some

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.910 
them because they're so tiny well some
of<00:04:00.090> them<00:04:00.239> are<00:04:00.389> actually<00:04:00.480> pretty<00:04:00.780> big<00:04:01.079> some<00:04:01.799> of

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
of them are actually pretty big some of

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.140 
of them are actually pretty big some of
them<00:04:02.010> are<00:04:02.130> smaller<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.609> it<00:04:02.849> doesn't<00:04:03.090> really

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
them are smaller so it doesn't really

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.379 
them are smaller so it doesn't really
matter<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.870> as<00:04:04.019> long<00:04:04.139> as<00:04:04.380> they<00:04:04.530> get<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:05.389> next

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389

but<00:06:22.670> whatever<00:06:22.970> and<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:24.380> protein<00:06:24.830> %<00:06:25.280> on<00:06:25.400> it<00:06:25.520> was

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
but whatever and the protein % on it was

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.400 
but whatever and the protein % on it was
pretty<00:06:25.850> good<00:06:26.060> too<00:06:26.120> i<00:06:26.300> forget<00:06:26.690> what<00:06:26.840> it<00:06:26.930> was<00:06:26.960> i

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
pretty good too i forget what it was i

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.020 
pretty good too i forget what it was i
think<00:06:27.590> it<00:06:27.710> was<00:06:27.830> like<00:06:27.950> sixteen<00:06:28.400> percent<00:06:28.790> which

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
think it was like sixteen percent which

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.360 
think it was like sixteen percent which
you<00:06:29.210> don't<00:06:29.360> really<00:06:29.600> see<00:06:29.780> that<00:06:29.810> often<00:06:30.170> with<00:06:31.160> a

hamster food besides hazel hamster has

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.050 
hamster food besides hazel hamster has
nineteen<00:06:34.280> percent<00:06:34.520> so<00:06:35.510> yeah<00:06:36.670> another<00:06:37.670> thing<00:06:37.760> I

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
nineteen percent so yeah another thing I

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.230 
nineteen percent so yeah another thing I
give<00:06:38.240> them<00:06:38.420> once<00:06:38.690> a<00:06:38.840> week<00:06:38.870> in<00:06:39.200> their<00:06:39.380> dish<00:06:39.650> is
