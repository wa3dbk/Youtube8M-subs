00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.010
 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.080
 I will explain how to install a new round 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.870
 which is a port of the Korean version 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.880
 lollipop for our 802 model 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 although it can also be installed in the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 of 805 with some procedures 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.860
 different we must download the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.809
 files that I will leave in the description 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.120
 of the video and save them in the memory of the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.430
 phone or in a usb memory for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 through tg use at home 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.920
 I will use the usb memory and the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.629
 How good will I connect the memory to 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.750
 device and the step is wanted 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.730
 restart in recovery mode for that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.640
 use this king book program since 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.339
 the rom resurrection remix was what 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.130
 had did not allow that option while 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.950
 this starts I'll tell you to install it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.040
 in the 802 will follow the steps as is 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.430
 like ours but for the 805 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.649
 the steps are the 4 with is to install the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.229
 rom uncheck the restart box 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.370
 install football and then install in 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.800
 part of here 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.660
 good once being here for both 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.890
 models what we should do and in a way 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.670
 optional is to make a backup of the rom 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.440
 complete in case something goes wrong 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 selecting all the options that 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.880
 appear here you should keep in mind that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 must have at least 4 gigabytes of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.020
 free memory but good and it says 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 that step so I will not do the following 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 What we should do is verify that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.080
 let's have the latest version of windows 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.960
 as you can see I have the 2.8 points 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.730
 3.1 so I do not need it but if I 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.710
 I need to leave the description of 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.800
 video a link to download it in the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.660
 which will only have to enter install 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.390
 look for it to flash it and then go 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.910
 to the reboot part and select 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 restart in good recovery once 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.020
 start and recovery of having installed the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.500
 latest version of the project we are going to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.970
 widgets and we do a factor and reset 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.110
 then we will do the already known 4 with es 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.640
 4 times 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.650
 this in order to make an installation 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.750
 as clean as possible remember no 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.550
 check the internal memory box to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.100
 unless they have already made a backup and 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.900
 want to clean all the memory then 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.180
 You already know how to select only the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.120
 waalwijk in cache 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.099
 in the data and the system once 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.840
 finished the four screams what not 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.870
 I know how to do is enter a tab 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.719
 install this for the 802 model and 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.330
 select the bootloader we select 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.970
 Vulgar the pride ourselves 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.810
 then move it we will go back to the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.120
 install section and we will pass the roma this 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.430
 robben is another because it has emerged from the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.760
 Korean version for our models of 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.760
 these others 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.650
 After pleasure we will see the aroma and 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.049
 to see which one we will give next 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.780
 install as you can see only us 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.030
 the 802 model appears if you have a 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.000
 right 05 do not worry select what 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.310
 same and it gives you next 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.780
 here they put us to select as 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.210
 we want the navigation menu of 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.860
 our the axis I will use the buttons 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.610
 by default but you can select 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.570
 some more reduced 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.120
 well I give next and install and 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.190
 the installation process will start 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.740
 remember that if you have an 805 and 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.900
 stressed they do not have to do the 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.460
 installation of the put loader but until 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.740
 after the installation of the rom no 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.150
 the bootloader is installed before 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.190
 install this rom 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.900
 I do not have this model of 05 with a 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.730
 partner of the white cube forum with 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.980
 steps and even leave in the description 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.520
 step by step how to install it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.170
 for the model of 802 videos 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.570
 good once the installation is finished 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.180
 we give in following and in this case 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.520
 because where I give facts that 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.140
 restart once if you do the installation 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.210
 through other people this error will come out 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.190
 of rossi in importance so 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.780
 we simply give it a restart 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.180
 Phone begin its process 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.650
 installation usually remember that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.120
 this next one can last around 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.010
 five minutes 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.630
 as you can see now it seems that they are 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.850
 configuring the initial applications 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.220
 of android and 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.970
 so it only remains to wait for it to end 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.970
 to configure it 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.400
 once finished it starts the process of 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.440
 configuration where we should simply 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.260
 select the language that we are going to 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.050
 use in this case spanish spain will 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.110
 we give next we will appear the option 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.210
 to select the client's wifi and good 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.370
 what remains is simply to configure 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.229
 our google account with our 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.210
 device in order to access the 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.650
 google apps and the place thor for 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.650
 install the applications that we want 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.350
 then the assistant of 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.900
 lg configuration to be able to install 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.480
 the notebook or select the type of 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.090
 bar that we want and select the 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.220
 name of the team once the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.240
 axis configuration we can see how 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.240
 start the system 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.669
 and based on version 5.0.1 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.050
 as you can see it runs very fluid 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.370
 and well that was all for today I hope that 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.860
