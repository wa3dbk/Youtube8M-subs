00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.969
 Aibio 51 is 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.559
 The statement is working on repertoire precision 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.549
 Was 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.140
 To introduce Mr. Kodaira 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.339
 got started with mafra 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.749
 In other words 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.939
 This 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.939
 It is a starter button of the engine 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.380
 Easy to understand 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.539
 I once again at a very special event that did Esse 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.170
 I feel great only this 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 Ryo Hattori 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.400
 It is left as a person even in the sex life expectancy from occurrence 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.010
 Because it is a machine 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.450
 I will do 188 years old children 188 days 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.300
 Decided more 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000
 In the game 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 This is the 5th 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.970
 I will cell structure 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.190
 Poly tank discovery 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.220
 decoration 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.830
 In nar 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 I'm actually in a cat this time, but 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.570
 Starter motor 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.600
 There is a large capacity starter motor. 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.390
 Those 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.390
 Replace this with a circle 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 Large is up, and also for vehicles 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.030
 At the beginning please use it by all means 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.970
 I will run for you 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.270
 Also this looks 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.840
 I'm sorry 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.990
 In the laser 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.800
 This logo is included 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.230
 This understands US aluminum cutting parts 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.640
 It is continued or 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.070
 To air cannon 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.200
 It looks like I'm lying down until I see this 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.840
 Those 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.050
 If it is accompanied by this 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.080
 This is Keiko 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.600
 It is Perth of effect to make around 11,000 yen 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.740
 In addition to this 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 After all what is the starter motor and width 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.910
 High 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.459
 It is serious 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.039
 If you go 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.089
 Then I find that I'm getting up right 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.459
 Even if it is a system 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 It is decided to move Sera away from politics ... 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.099
 That means 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.459
 The battery is expensive 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.780
 It was a lot of fun for thermo to fit elsewhere 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.399
 Then, for example, the motor may burn 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.689
 Cause trouble 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.439
 Because 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.290
 This year 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.299
 You may go up 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.849
 I plan to do engine tuning after this 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:39.869
 What 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.549
 Ahead of the backrest for a moment 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.439
 What is good 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.489
 This makes it easy to start the engine on one hand 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.530
 That is kind to battery, too 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.290
 There is no better thing than this, but to add to this 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.349
 so 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.440
 This heavyweight player will keep on going 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.859
 The plan is also 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.299
 China is already in progress 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.839
 That person of the starter motor 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:07.909
 With that 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.219
 Long-awaited valve engine 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.019
 This is this mf al star busy training 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.669
 I will tell you the whole thing 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.930
 This real one is actually also 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.359
 It was attached 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.099
 Fake included 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.949
 I tried running the engine 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.329
 alt and my wife 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.299
 Transportation expenses 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.719
 Everyone this 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.669
 I kept hitting 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.039
 We will consider the introduction
