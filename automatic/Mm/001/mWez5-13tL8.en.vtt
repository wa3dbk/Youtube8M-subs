00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
first costume which is essentially the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
costume is much lighter I'd say in terms

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.590 
costume is much lighter I'd say in terms
of<00:01:37.650> colors<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> grey<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.060> lighter<00:01:39.360> in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
of colors is the grey is much lighter in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.889 
of colors is the grey is much lighter in
here<00:01:39.780> he's<00:01:40.170> cut<00:01:40.380> he<00:01:40.650> looks<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:40.979> he's<00:01:41.100> really

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
here he's cut he looks like he's really

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.270 
here he's cut he looks like he's really
bulked<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.439> he<00:01:43.590> has<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> lot<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
bulked up you know he has like a lot of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.480 
bulked up you know he has like a lot of
muscles<00:01:44.759> everywhere<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> pretty<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:50.189> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
muscles everywhere so pretty much I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.230 
muscles everywhere so pretty much I
think<00:01:50.520> what's<00:01:51.299> happening<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
think what's happening is that it is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.929 
think what's happening is that it is
just<00:01:54.570> basic<00:01:54.960> attacks<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.189> game<00:01:56.640> was

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
just basic attacks i think the game was

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.410 
just basic attacks i think the game was
already<00:01:57.149> beaten<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
already beaten and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.800 
already beaten and
then<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.890> video<00:02:00.220> was<00:02:00.549> taken<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:01.180> he's<00:02:01.360> casting

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
then the video was taken so he's casting

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.929 
then the video was taken so he's casting
some<00:02:02.020> bad<00:02:02.290> stuff<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:03.040> think<00:02:03.310> that's<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.610> bat

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
some bad stuff I think that's the bat

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.719 
some bad stuff I think that's the bat
spell<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.689> that<00:02:05.229> is<00:02:05.470> def<00:02:05.830> stroke<00:02:06.340> if<00:02:06.610> you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
spell and that is def stroke if you

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.440 
spell and that is def stroke if you
don't<00:02:06.970> know<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.880> swipe<00:02:10.149> these

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450
