00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.260 
basically it will continuously buff
every<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.369> every<00:01:44.610> buff<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> can

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
every one with every buff as you can

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
every one with every buff as you can
which<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> great<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.290> paladins<00:01:46.710> who<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
which is great for paladins who have to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.490 
which is great for paladins who have to
cast<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.640> 12<00:01:47.939> buffs<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.600> typical<00:01:49.290> raid

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
cast like 12 buffs in a typical raid

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.760 
cast like 12 buffs in a typical raid
that's<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.159> overstatement<00:01:50.520> max<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.360> 10

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
that's an overstatement max is 10

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.670 
that's an overstatement max is 10
anyways<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.579> great<00:01:53.820> time-saver<00:01:54.500> also<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
anyways it's a great time-saver also it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
anyways it's a great time-saver also it
has<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> feature<00:01:56.159> called<00:01:56.310> spell<00:01:56.880> tracker<00:01:57.180> which
