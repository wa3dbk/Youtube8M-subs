00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
we're heading up a few miles to the

with<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.699> at<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.180> mile<00:00:18.510> straight<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.380> as

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
with a look at the mile straight and as

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.130 
with a look at the mile straight and as
the<00:00:20.220> name<00:00:20.369> suggests<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.869> very

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the name suggests this is a very

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.590 
the name suggests this is a very
straight<00:00:22.529> mile<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.100> canal<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.300> still

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
straight mile of canal but it's still

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.140 
straight mile of canal but it's still
just<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.410> imagine<00:00:25.890> super<00:00:26.490> rural<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
just what you imagine super rural and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.570 
just what you imagine super rural and
got<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.260> classic<00:00:28.680> come<00:00:28.859> back<00:00:29.070> bridges

and<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> great<00:00:30.630> Anglia<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.410> shows

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and this is a great Anglia that shows

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
and this is a great Anglia that shows
just<00:00:32.309> how<00:00:32.460> perfectly<00:00:33.120> down<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.750> line<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.170> can

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
just how perfectly down the line you can

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.709 
just how perfectly down the line you can
look<00:00:34.530> from<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.040> back<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> boats<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> when

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
look from the back of the boats and when

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
look from the back of the boats and when
I<00:00:36.750> say<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.200> straight<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.010> very<00:00:38.399> straight

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
I say it's straight it is very straight

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
I say it's straight it is very straight
indeed<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:40.020> quite<00:00:40.379> interesting<00:00:40.770> really

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
indeed it's quite interesting really

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.430 
indeed it's quite interesting really
that<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:42.059> Montgomery<00:00:42.719> stretch<00:00:43.079> they're

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that this Montgomery stretch they're

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.250 
that this Montgomery stretch they're
constantly<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.760> working<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.539> reopen<00:00:45.719> more

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
constantly they working to reopen more

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.590 
constantly they working to reopen more
and<00:00:46.440> more<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> these<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> top<00:00:48.329> few

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and more of it and these are the top few

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
and more of it and these are the top few
miles<00:00:48.840> between<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.649> junction<00:00:50.100> at<00:00:50.219> Franklin

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
miles between the junction at Franklin

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.630 
miles between the junction at Franklin
and<00:00:50.969> Queen's<00:00:51.360> Head<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:52.230> where<00:00:52.949> it's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and Queen's Head like I say where it's

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
and Queen's Head like I say where it's
currently<00:00:53.910> open<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.539> seven<00:00:55.079> miles<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.559> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
currently open about seven miles on this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
currently open about seven miles on this
stretch<00:00:55.980> line<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.489> Main<00:00:56.670> Street<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.690> there's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
stretch line for Main Street but there's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.650 
stretch line for Main Street but there's
so<00:00:58.410> many<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.829> these<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.640> really<00:01:00.149> straight

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so many of these really really straight

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
so many of these really really straight
pieces<00:01:00.989> again<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.640> another

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
pieces again you can see this is another

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
pieces again you can see this is another
very<00:01:03.210> long<00:01:03.420> straight<00:01:03.809> stretch<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.979> has

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
very long straight stretch here that has

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.830 
very long straight stretch here that has
one<00:01:05.400> corner<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> we'll<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> minute

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
one corner and we'll see in a minute

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.399 
one corner and we'll see in a minute
goes<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.619> yet<00:01:08.189> another<00:01:08.369> straight<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.049> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
goes to yet another straight and this is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.280 
goes to yet another straight and this is
rather<00:01:10.740> interesting<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.790> swing<00:01:12.330> bridge<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.930> have

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
rather interesting a swing bridge I have

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
rather interesting a swing bridge I have
no<00:01:13.500> idea<00:01:13.799> how<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> works<00:01:14.340> I've<00:01:14.640> never<00:01:14.909> come

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
no idea how it works I've never come

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
no idea how it works I've never come
across<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.810> my<00:01:15.960> general<00:01:16.710> cruising<00:01:17.280> but

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
across one in my general cruising but

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.480 
across one in my general cruising but
this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.330> first<00:01:18.630> detour<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this is our first detour for just a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
this is our first detour for just a
little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.030> an<00:01:21.150> abandoned<00:01:21.780> canal<00:01:22.229> stretch

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
little bit of an abandoned canal stretch

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
little bit of an abandoned canal stretch
and<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.180> discovered<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.200> my

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and this was discovered by me and my

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
and this was discovered by me and my
good<00:01:25.470> friend<00:01:25.770> John<00:01:26.009> Osteen<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.150> we

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
good friend John Osteen here as we

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.140 
good friend John Osteen here as we
passed<00:01:27.689> under<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.590> bridge<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.670> kamui

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
passed under that bridge on the kamui

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.990 
passed under that bridge on the kamui
once<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:31.560> ended<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.100> discovery<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.790> this

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
once and we ended up discovery in this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
once and we ended up discovery in this
little<00:01:33.299> place<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> certainly<00:01:34.409> couldn't

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
little place now you certainly couldn't

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.380 
little place now you certainly couldn't
take<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> boat<00:01:35.369> down<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> minutes

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
take a boat down here in the minutes

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
take a boat down here in the minutes
because<00:01:36.600> there's<00:01:37.140> trees<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.740> overgrown<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
because there's trees all overgrown and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.090 
because there's trees all overgrown and
it<00:01:39.030> looks<00:01:39.299> very<00:01:39.509> shallow<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.770> when<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it looks very shallow and then when you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.980 
it looks very shallow and then when you
do<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.060> basin<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> opens<00:01:42.810> up

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
do get to the little basin it opens up

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
do get to the little basin it opens up
into<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.610> full<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> weed

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
into you can see that it's full of weed

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.749 
into you can see that it's full of weed
and<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:46.259> generally<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.979> looking<00:01:47.310> great<00:01:47.430> for

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and just generally not looking great for

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
and just generally not looking great for
boating<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.750> I'm<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.170> sure<00:01:49.439> whether<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
boating but I'm not sure whether this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.710 
boating but I'm not sure whether this
would<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.340> been<00:01:50.460> an<00:01:50.670> old<00:01:50.790> loading<00:01:51.149> yard<00:01:51.509> or

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
would have been an old loading yard or

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.300 
would have been an old loading yard or
something<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.229> there's<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> railway<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.130> runs

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
something so there's a railway that runs

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.429 
something so there's a railway that runs
quite<00:01:53.610> close<00:01:53.909> by<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.290> was

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
quite close by but you can see there was

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
quite close by but you can see there was
a<00:01:55.470> proper<00:01:55.950> built-up<00:01:56.340> structure<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.600> must

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
a proper built-up structure so it must

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
a proper built-up structure so it must
have<00:01:57.899> had<00:01:58.079> some<00:01:58.380> sort<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> proper<00:01:59.460> use<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
have had some sort of proper use and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300 
have had some sort of proper use and
heavy<00:02:00.479> usage<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.619> proper<00:02:01.979> built

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
heavy usage to have these proper built

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.850 
heavy usage to have these proper built
in<00:02:02.549> sides<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.049> that's<00:02:04.409> something<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
in sides like this so that's something I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.350 
in sides like this so that's something I
should<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.460> looked<00:02:05.700> up<00:02:05.880> before<00:02:06.210> this

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
should really have looked up before this

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.429 
should really have looked up before this
video<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.719> suppose

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
video I suppose

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.010 
video I suppose
anyway<00:02:08.039> as<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.429> find<00:02:09.090> our<00:02:09.270> way<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.660> through

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
anyway as we find our way going through

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.830 
anyway as we find our way going through
the<00:02:10.140> nettles<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.590> our<00:02:10.709> shorts<00:02:11.129> let's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
the nettles in our shorts let's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080 
the nettles in our shorts let's
back<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.650> see<00:02:12.830> more<00:02:13.129> of<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.879> how

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
back on and see more of just how

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.140 
back on and see more of just how
straight<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:14.840> canal<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:16.879> love

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
straight this canal is I really do love

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.600 
straight this canal is I really do love
the<00:02:17.360> Montgomery<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:18.080> I've<00:02:18.260> said<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.099> many<00:02:19.370> many

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610

the Montgomery as I've said in many many
videos<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.360> them<00:02:20.510> plenty<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.379> these<00:02:21.530> sort<00:02:21.890> of

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800 
videos and them plenty of these sort of
scenery<00:02:22.220> videos<00:02:22.760> around<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:23.300> because<00:02:23.629> it's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
scenery videos around here because it's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.770 
scenery videos around here because it's
just<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.349> rural<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:25.370> used<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.209> iron<00:02:26.510> goth

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
just so rural I'm used to the iron goth

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.320 
just so rural I'm used to the iron goth
link<00:02:27.050> now<00:02:27.290> which<00:02:27.560> itself<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.310> certainly<00:02:29.150> an

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
link now which itself is certainly an

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.750 
link now which itself is certainly an
extremely<00:02:30.080> rural<00:02:30.319> demonstration<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.430> how

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
extremely rural demonstration of how

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.170 
extremely rural demonstration of how
amazingly<00:02:32.750> scenic<00:02:33.290> now<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.920> be<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.670> once<00:02:35.000> you

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
amazingly scenic now can be but once you

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.910 
amazingly scenic now can be but once you
get<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.660> places<00:02:36.049> like<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.799> the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
get to places like this on the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.640 
get to places like this on the
Montgomery<00:02:37.430> where<00:02:37.700> you're<00:02:38.299> talking<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.989> just

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
Montgomery where you're talking of just

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.520 
Montgomery where you're talking of just
nothing<00:02:40.489> around<00:02:40.670> for<00:02:41.000> miles<00:02:41.450> upon<00:02:41.870> miles<00:02:42.140> but

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
nothing around for miles upon miles but

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.650 
nothing around for miles upon miles but
fields<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.610> we're<00:02:43.940> looking<00:02:44.150> at<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.299> very<00:02:44.510> small

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
fields and we're looking at a very small

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.110 
fields and we're looking at a very small
walk<00:02:45.140> there<00:02:45.440> as<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.849> is<00:02:47.090> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
walk there as you can see this is a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.300 
walk there as you can see this is a
great<00:02:47.480> little<00:02:47.780> place<00:02:47.989> just<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> very<00:02:48.980> very

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
great little place just on a very very

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.160 
great little place just on a very very
steep<00:02:49.640> humpback<00:02:50.180> bridge<00:02:50.360> here<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.930> show<00:02:51.110> you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
steep humpback bridge here to show you

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.440 
steep humpback bridge here to show you
how<00:02:51.530> rural<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.340> as<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:52.940> look<00:02:53.150> across<00:02:53.269> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
how rural it is as we look across a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.449 
how rural it is as we look across a
little<00:02:53.780> Basin<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.380> I'm<00:02:54.560> from<00:02:54.769> Franklin<00:02:55.040> and

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
little Basin just I'm from Franklin and

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.229 
little Basin just I'm from Franklin and
this<00:02:56.299> here<00:02:56.629> is<00:02:56.870> one<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.920> sort<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:58.910> dead

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
this here is one of the sort of dead

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.420 
this here is one of the sort of dead
ends<00:02:59.629> of<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> canal<00:03:00.140> which<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.860> was<00:03:01.160> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
ends of the canal which this was the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.759 
ends of the canal which this was the
western<00:03:02.030> branch<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.510> think<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.319> see<00:03:03.500> where

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
western branch I think you can see where

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.619 
western branch I think you can see where
all<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.099> wind<00:03:04.280> blows<00:03:04.700> all<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.000> rubbish<00:03:05.450> to

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
all the wind blows all the rubbish to

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.930 
all the wind blows all the rubbish to
collect<00:03:05.930> up<00:03:06.110> in<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.379> corner<00:03:06.739> there<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.129> this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
collect up in the corner there and this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.650 
collect up in the corner there and this
literally<00:03:08.450> only<00:03:09.170> goes<00:03:09.379> as<00:03:09.709> far<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:10.510> where<00:03:11.510> you

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
literally only goes as far as where you

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.780 
literally only goes as far as where you
could<00:03:11.840> see<00:03:12.019> just<00:03:12.290> then<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:12.980> when<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:13.280> stand<00:03:13.610> on

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
could see just then so when we stand on

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.610 
could see just then so when we stand on
the<00:03:13.940> end<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:14.480> look<00:03:14.629> back<00:03:14.840> up<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.590> can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the end of it and look back up you can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.229 
the end of it and look back up you can
see<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.010> we<00:03:16.310> haven't<00:03:16.609> travelled<00:03:16.970> any

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
see that we haven't travelled any

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.360 
see that we haven't travelled any
distance<00:03:17.780> at<00:03:17.900> all<00:03:18.109> really<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:18.980> that's<00:03:19.130> not

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
distance at all really so that's not

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.190 
distance at all really so that's not
much<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.639> a<00:03:19.880> great<00:03:20.120> abandoned<00:03:20.690> stretch<00:03:20.959> to

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
much of a great abandoned stretch to

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.229 
much of a great abandoned stretch to
show<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.440> really<00:03:21.769> but<00:03:22.100> there's<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.670> path<00:03:22.940> that

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
show you really but there's a path that

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.569 
show you really but there's a path that
goes<00:03:23.450> on<00:03:23.750> forever<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.739> don't<00:03:25.100> know<00:03:25.370> what's

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
goes on forever and I don't know what's

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.670 
goes on forever and I don't know what's
up<00:03:25.850> there<00:03:25.910> beyond<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.870> but<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.349> just<00:03:27.560> thought

up there beyond that but I just thought
it<00:03:27.739> was<00:03:27.829> with<00:03:28.069> putting<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.910> camera<00:03:29.269> there<00:03:29.420> and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
it was with putting the camera there and

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
previous video that shows you the lowest

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.839 
previous video that shows you the lowest
stretch<00:03:57.500> which<00:03:57.739> has<00:03:57.889> got<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.099> few<00:03:58.370> more<00:03:58.549> locks

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
stretch which has got a few more locks

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.759 
stretch which has got a few more locks
and<00:03:59.180> just<00:03:59.720> I<00:03:59.930> don't<00:04:00.049> know<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.290> think<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:00.680> a

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
and just I don't know I think it's a

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.229 
and just I don't know I think it's a
little<00:04:00.980> bit<00:04:01.099> more<00:04:01.280> scenic<00:04:01.760> because<00:04:02.120> it

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
little bit more scenic because it

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.150 
little bit more scenic because it
doesn't<00:04:02.510> look<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:02.840> straight<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.530> industrial

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
doesn't look so straight and industrial

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.039 
doesn't look so straight and industrial
