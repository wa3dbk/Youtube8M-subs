moves<00:00:33.660> into<00:00:34.140> his<00:00:34.440> lifts<00:00:34.950> okay<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.630> he<00:00:36.899> moves

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
moves into his lifts okay so as he moves

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
into his lifts he kind of starts his

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.819 
into his lifts he kind of starts his
hands<00:00:41.309> low<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.969> he<00:00:42.090> pulls<00:00:42.450> his<00:00:42.719> knee<00:00:42.989> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
hands low and he pulls his knee really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.060 
hands low and he pulls his knee really
to<00:00:44.190> almost<00:00:44.550> his<00:00:44.910> back<00:00:45.239> shoulder<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.800> he

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
to almost his back shoulder and as he

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.350 
to almost his back shoulder and as he
does<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.730> he<00:00:48.390> rotates<00:00:49.020> his<00:00:49.170> entire<00:00:49.620> torso

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
does this he rotates his entire torso

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.660 
does this he rotates his entire torso
over<00:00:51.360> rotating<00:00:51.870> his<00:00:52.110> shoulders<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.340> bring

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
over rotating his shoulders and bring

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.830 
over rotating his shoulders and bring
his<00:00:53.910> knee<00:00:54.210> back<00:00:54.649> towards<00:00:55.649> centerfield<00:00:56.840> okay

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
his knee back towards centerfield okay

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.590 
his knee back towards centerfield okay
so<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.530> his<00:00:58.739> move<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.399> he<00:01:00.030> starts<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so this is his move as he starts to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.130 
so this is his move as he starts to
prepare<00:01:00.859> to<00:01:01.859> separate<00:01:02.370> his<00:01:02.579> hands<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.420> move

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
prepare to separate his hands and move

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.850 
prepare to separate his hands and move
into<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.920> pitch<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
into the pitch and now what we want to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.060 
into the pitch and now what we want to
do<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.970> compare<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.689> same<00:01:10.049> movement<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> how

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
do is compare the same movement of how

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.719 
do is compare the same movement of how
else<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.780> pitcher<00:01:13.110> gets<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.680> his<00:01:13.920> live<00:01:14.280> with

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
else the pitcher gets into his live with

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.410 
else the pitcher gets into his live with
Lincecum's<00:01:15.500> predecessors<00:01:16.500> who<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:18.060> all

start here with Roger Clemens and this
is<00:01:45.570> early<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.020> his<00:01:46.350> career<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.659> Clemens<00:01:48.659> moves

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
is early in his career and Clemens moves

into<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> his<00:01:49.530> list<00:01:49.890> by<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.430> overhead<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
into it his list by going overhead and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.719 
into it his list by going overhead and
as<00:01:52.680> he<00:01:52.890> comes<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> top<00:01:54.829> his<00:01:55.829> hands<00:01:56.490> come

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
as he comes to the top his hands come

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.950 
as he comes to the top his hands come
down<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.450> he<00:01:58.049> meets<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.770> middle<00:01:59.390> okay<00:02:00.390> but

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
down and he meets in the middle okay but

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.190 
down and he meets in the middle okay but
the<00:02:01.049> key<00:02:01.290> thing<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:02.719> and<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:03.930> what

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the key thing is here and I think what

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.929 
the key thing is here and I think what
you'll<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.799> most<00:02:05.009> common<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
you'll see is most common here with the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.660 
you'll see is most common here with the
predecessors<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.869> notice<00:02:07.680> Clemens<00:02:08.160> shoulders

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
predecessors is notice Clemens shoulders

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.710 
predecessors is notice Clemens shoulders
are<00:02:08.849> still<00:02:09.560> right<00:02:10.560> towards<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> target<00:02:11.720> okay

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
are still right towards the target okay

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
are still right towards the target okay
he's<00:02:13.020> not<00:02:13.050> over

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
he's not over

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.830 
he's not over
rotated<00:02:14.250> light<00:02:14.400> Lincecum<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.600> see<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
rotated light Lincecum you can see the

2009<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.750> wasted<00:04:37.530> movement<00:04:38.070> he's<00:04:38.460> not

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
2009 is just a wasted movement he's not

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.730 
2009 is just a wasted movement he's not
doing<00:04:39.030> anything<00:04:39.210> in<00:04:39.510> here<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.139> not<00:04:40.440> really

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
doing anything in here is not really

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.830 
doing anything in here is not really
loading<00:04:41.100> his<00:04:41.190> hips<00:04:41.490> there's<00:04:42.060> no<00:04:42.360> added

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
loading his hips there's no added

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.400 
loading his hips there's no added
benefit<00:04:43.410> by<00:04:43.800> over<00:04:44.250> rotating<00:04:44.730> early<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:46.200> now<00:04:46.350> we

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
benefit by over rotating early so now we

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.750 
benefit by over rotating early so now we
want<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.889> look<00:04:47.040> at<00:04:47.310> how<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.330> arm<00:04:48.980> comes<00:04:49.980> out<00:04:50.430> of

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
want to look at how the arm comes out of

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.540 
want to look at how the arm comes out of
the<00:04:50.880> glove<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:52.290> me<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:53.070> is<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.400> most

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
the glove and to me this is the most

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.310 
the glove and to me this is the most
important<00:04:54.090> deal<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.780> what<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:54.960> call

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
important deal and this is what I call

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.159 
important deal and this is what I call
the<00:04:55.770> arm<00:04:56.010> swing<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:57.060> Lincecum<00:04:57.540> arm<00:04:57.810> swings

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
the arm swing so Lincecum arm swings

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.950 
the arm swing so Lincecum arm swings
comes<00:04:58.530> out<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:59.370> remains<00:04:59.760> very<00:04:59.970> rigid<00:05:00.720> very

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
comes out it remains very rigid very

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.980 
comes out it remains very rigid very
long<00:05:01.830> kind<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.610> hangs<00:05:02.880> out<00:05:03.150> behind<00:05:03.540> his<00:05:03.750> right

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
long kind of hangs out behind his right

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.690 
long kind of hangs out behind his right
hip<00:05:04.260> he's<00:05:04.470> not<00:05:04.650> going<00:05:04.979> anywhere<00:05:05.010> as<00:05:05.490> he's

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
hip he's not going anywhere as he's

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.680 
hip he's not going anywhere as he's
moving<00:05:06.060> okay<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:07.380> it's<00:05:07.830> not<00:05:07.950> fluid

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
moving okay so it's it's not fluid

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.780 
moving okay so it's it's not fluid
everything's<00:05:09.690> not<00:05:09.900> moving<00:05:10.350> together<00:05:10.790> okay

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
everything's not moving together okay

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.659 
everything's not moving together okay
and<00:05:11.820> this<00:05:12.150> is<00:05:12.300> part<00:05:12.570> of<00:05:12.630> his<00:05:12.810> time<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.350> rhythm

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
and this is part of his time and rhythm

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.700 
and this is part of his time and rhythm
sometimes<00:05:14.669> when<00:05:14.970> he<00:05:15.030> over<00:05:15.389> rotates<00:05:15.870> his<00:05:16.350> hand

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
sometimes when he over rotates his hand

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.860 
sometimes when he over rotates his hand
will<00:05:16.830> get<00:05:16.950> stuck<00:05:17.400> back<00:05:17.669> here<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.330> then<00:05:18.720> he's

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
will get stuck back here and then he's

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.200 
will get stuck back here and then he's
got<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.080> make<00:05:19.320> up<00:05:19.560> for<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.860> quicker<00:05:20.280> than<00:05:21.060> he

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
got to make up for it quicker than he

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.870 
got to make up for it quicker than he
has<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.919> leads<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.220> a<00:05:23.310> lot<00:05:23.370> of<00:05:23.610> timing

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
has to so it leads to a lot of timing

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.870 
has to so it leads to a lot of timing
issues<00:05:24.419> that's<00:05:25.020> why<00:05:25.260> he<00:05:25.380> talked<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.919> he<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:26.639> try

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
issues that's why he talked to he so try

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.810 
issues that's why he talked to he so try
too<00:05:26.940> big<00:05:27.150> on<00:05:27.300> find<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:27.780> good<00:05:27.960> rhythm<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.470> timing

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
too big on find a good rhythm and timing

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.730 
too big on find a good rhythm and timing
before<00:05:29.820> he<00:05:29.970> goes<00:05:30.150> out<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.539> mound<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.260> this

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
before he goes out to the mound and this

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.360 
before he goes out to the mound and this
is<00:05:31.950> just<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.280> hard<00:05:32.729> move<00:05:33.090> initially<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.560> to

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
is just a hard move initially to to

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.360 
is just a hard move initially to to
really<00:05:35.760> kind<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.979> overcompensate<00:05:37.979> and<00:05:38.010> kind

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
really kind of overcompensate and kind

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.640 
really kind of overcompensate and kind
of<00:05:38.460> move<00:05:38.640> into<00:05:38.850> from<00:05:39.300> because<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.229> leads<00:05:40.470> to

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
of move into from because this leads to

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.580 
of move into from because this leads to
a<00:05:40.770> lot<00:05:40.950> of<00:05:40.979> timing<00:05:41.700> and<00:05:41.940> rhythm<00:05:42.570> issue<00:05:42.990> just

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
a lot of timing and rhythm issue just

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.650 
a lot of timing and rhythm issue just
because<00:05:43.919> you're<00:05:44.100> over<00:05:44.460> rotated<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.300> then

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
because you're over rotated and then

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.960 
because you're over rotated and then
everything<00:05:46.169> has<00:05:46.289> got<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:46.500> be<00:05:46.710> back<00:05:47.370> in<00:05:47.640> center

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
everything has got to be back in center

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.730 
everything has got to be back in center
and<00:05:48.000> you<00:05:48.240> have<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.570> be<00:05:48.690> absolutely<00:05:49.380> perfect

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
and you have to be absolutely perfect

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.469 
and you have to be absolutely perfect
now<00:05:50.580> we're<00:05:50.700> going<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:50.880> go<00:05:51.060> through<00:05:51.330> these

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
now we're going to go through these

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.020 
now we're going to go through these
pretty<00:05:51.720> quickly<00:05:51.870> but<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:52.890> can<00:05:53.250> see<00:05:53.490> as<00:05:53.820> well

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
pretty quickly but you can see as well

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.790 
pretty quickly but you can see as well
as<00:05:54.240> Clemens<00:05:54.930> comes<00:05:55.350> out<00:05:55.590> here<00:05:56.060> very<00:05:57.060> fluid

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
as Clemens comes out here very fluid

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.100 
as Clemens comes out here very fluid
everything<00:05:58.800> works<00:05:59.160> together<00:05:59.840> very<00:06:00.840> very

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
everything works together very very

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.800 
everything works together very very
nicely<00:06:01.800> look<00:06:02.280> out<00:06:02.460> his<00:06:02.580> hand<00:06:02.880> to<00:06:03.000> stand<00:06:03.240> over

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
nicely look out his hand to stand over

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.110 
nicely look out his hand to stand over
the<00:06:03.900> ball<00:06:04.139> all<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.770> way<00:06:05.130> until<00:06:05.610> he<00:06:05.669> kind<00:06:06.030> of

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
the ball all the way until he kind of

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.879 
the ball all the way until he kind of
gets<00:06:06.330> right<00:06:06.720> into<00:06:07.020> where<00:06:07.139> his<00:06:07.320> front<00:06:07.620> foot

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
gets right into where his front foot

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.219 
gets right into where his front foot
hits<00:06:09.410> let's<00:06:10.410> go<00:06:10.710> into<00:06:11.130> David<00:06:11.729> Cone<00:06:12.030> now<00:06:12.750> cone

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
hits let's go into David Cone now cone

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.610 
hits let's go into David Cone now cone
here<00:06:13.830> his<00:06:14.280> arm<00:06:14.550> action<00:06:14.910> starts<00:06:15.389> off<00:06:15.630> the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
here his arm action starts off the

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.100 
here his arm action starts off the
closest<00:06:17.190> I<00:06:17.340> could<00:06:17.400> find<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:18.030> Lincecum<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:19.020> if

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
closest I could find to Lincecum so if

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.379 
closest I could find to Lincecum so if
you<00:06:19.229> really<00:06:19.590> look<00:06:19.800> at<00:06:19.950> these<00:06:20.460> positions<00:06:21.090> look

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
you really look at these positions look

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.070 
you really look at these positions look
similar<00:06:21.810> but<00:06:22.500> what<00:06:22.680> you<00:06:22.830> can<00:06:22.979> see<00:06:23.010> from<00:06:23.550> cone

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
similar but what you can see from cone

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.070 
similar but what you can see from cone
one<00:06:25.080> it's<00:06:25.590> always<00:06:25.830> moving<00:06:26.610> together<00:06:26.850> and<00:06:27.479> it

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
one it's always moving together and it

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.350 
one it's always moving together and it
gets<00:06:28.260> right<00:06:28.500> up<00:06:28.770> into<00:06:28.950> the<00:06:29.190> good<00:06:29.460> position<00:06:30.090> as

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
gets right up into the good position as

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.990 
gets right up into the good position as
his<00:06:30.870> body<00:06:31.139> is<00:06:31.410> moving<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:32.250> doesn't<00:06:32.669> hang<00:06:32.850> out

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
his body is moving it doesn't hang out

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.570 
his body is moving it doesn't hang out
by<00:06:33.240> his<00:06:33.419> hips<00:06:33.720> everything's<00:06:34.440> moving<00:06:34.800> together
