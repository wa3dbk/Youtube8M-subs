I'm leaving the bottom intact and what
I'm<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.239> I'm<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> cut<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
I'm going to do is I'm going to cut the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:50.959 
I'm going to do is I'm going to cut the
shape<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.680> petals<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:49.969> there's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
shape of petals you can see that there's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.990 
shape of petals you can see that there's
one<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:55.550> thinking<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.699> probably

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
one right there and thinking we probably

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
one right there and thinking we probably
can<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.780> four<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> each<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> then

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
can get about four out of each and then

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.289 
can get about four out of each and then
you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.239> fold<00:01:03.480> those<00:01:03.719> back<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.119> just

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you can fold those back and I'm just

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.580 
you can fold those back and I'm just
gonna<00:01:06.420> cut<00:01:07.159> like<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> couple<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> small<00:01:09.590> little

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
gonna cut like a couple of small little

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
one line the back and then you kind of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.920 
one line the back and then you kind of
space<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.100> way<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.630> attach

space them that way and you can attach

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
space them that way and you can attach
them<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.470> glue<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.850> different<00:01:45.240> metal

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
them with a glue that is different metal

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
them with a glue that is different metal
like<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:48.020> 86,000<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.490> basically<00:01:50.490> bonds

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
like this 86,000 like basically bonds

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.969 
like this 86,000 like basically bonds
just<00:01:50.939> about<00:01:51.270> anything<00:01:51.630> together<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
just about anything together so you can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
just about anything together so you can
just<00:01:53.100> bond<00:01:53.369> those<00:01:53.579> together<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.060> way<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
just bond those together that way if you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.459 
just bond those together that way if you
want<00:01:55.880> or<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.090> could<00:01:57.270> put<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> screw<00:01:58.200> or

and<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.940> want<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.360> Styrofoam<00:02:36.780> ball<00:02:36.900> completely

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and I want the Styrofoam ball completely

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.900 
and I want the Styrofoam ball completely
covered<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.980> glue<00:02:38.190> cuz<00:02:38.790> then

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
covered with the glue cuz then

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.580 
covered with the glue cuz then
everything<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.480> protected<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.260> everything

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
everything is protected and everything

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.360 
everything is protected and everything
is<00:02:40.709> fine

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.070 

and<00:02:47.849> then<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.209> keep<00:02:48.390> working<00:02:48.900> your<00:02:48.930> way

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and then just keep working your way

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.949 
and then just keep working your way
around<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.849> don't<00:02:53.910> care<00:02:54.269> about<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.569> colors

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
around and I don't care about the colors

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.490 
around and I don't care about the colors
because<00:02:57.650> what's<00:02:58.650> gonna<00:02:58.800> happen<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.910> I'm

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
because what's gonna happen is I'm

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.020 
because what's gonna happen is I'm
painting<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> black<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.700> brown<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
painting it like a black or a brown I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.670 
painting it like a black or a brown I
think<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.450> only<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.690> black<00:03:03.989> spray-paint<00:03:04.349> so

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
think I only have black spray-paint so

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.009 
think I only have black spray-paint so
I'll<00:03:04.769> probably<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.099> do<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> black<00:03:05.989> but<00:03:06.989> you

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
I'll probably just do it black but you

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.530 
I'll probably just do it black but you
know<00:03:07.230> they<00:03:07.349> have<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> lot<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.799> those<00:03:08.069> other

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
know they have a lot of those other

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.420 
know they have a lot of those other
spray<00:03:09.540> paints<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> hammered<00:03:11.330> kind<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
spray paints like a hammered kind of a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.309 
spray paints like a hammered kind of a
brown<00:03:14.430> which<00:03:14.819> would<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.120> cool<00:03:15.330> also<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.260> I

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
brown which would be cool also but I

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.170 
brown which would be cool also but I
don't<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.769> don't<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.580> have<00:03:17.849> any<00:03:18.000> more

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
don't I don't think I have any more

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.600 
don't I don't think I have any more
event<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.200> all<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:19.530> gonna<00:03:19.620> do<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:19.920> continue<00:03:20.579> to

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
event so all I'm gonna do is continue to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.319 
event so all I'm gonna do is continue to
around<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.799> make<00:03:23.220> sure<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.090> whole

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
around and make sure that the whole

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.000 
around and make sure that the whole
Styrofoam<00:03:24.989> ball<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.260> covered<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.829> glue

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
Styrofoam ball is covered with the glue

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.180 
Styrofoam ball is covered with the glue
and<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.120> pushpins<00:03:27.739> when<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.829> get<00:03:28.950> all<00:03:29.069> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
and the pushpins when you get all the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.809 
and the pushpins when you get all the
pushpins<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:30.120> let<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.750> dry<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.319> then<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.519> would

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
pushpins in let it dry and then it would

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.819 
pushpins in let it dry and then it would
be<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> good<00:03:33.120> idea<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.660> put<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> coat<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.620> glue

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
be a good idea to put a coat of the glue

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.860 
be a good idea to put a coat of the glue
on<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> bottom<00:03:35.370> also<00:03:35.879> just<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.450> seal<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
on the bottom also just to seal it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.900 
on the bottom also just to seal it
because<00:03:37.349> we<00:03:37.500> will<00:03:37.739> be<00:03:37.890> spray-painting<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
because we will be spray-painting it and

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.140 
because we will be spray-painting it and
when<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.870> spray-paint<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.920> spray<00:03:41.910> paint

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
when we spray-paint it a spray paint

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.069 
when we spray-paint it a spray paint
will<00:03:42.329> normally<00:03:42.989> dissolve<00:03:44.450> styrofoam<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.840> that

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
will normally dissolve styrofoam so that

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.569 
will normally dissolve styrofoam so that
way<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.709> glue<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.160> there<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
way if you have the glue on there and

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.400 
way if you have the glue on there and
it's<00:03:47.730> all<00:03:47.849> dry<00:03:48.120> it'll<00:03:48.480> seal<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.049> it'll<00:03:49.319> be

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
it's all dry it'll seal it and it'll be

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.890 
it's all dry it'll seal it and it'll be
good<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.650> go<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.370> let<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.910> dry<00:03:51.239> I'm<00:03:51.480> gonna<00:03:51.690> run

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
good to go so let that dry I'm gonna run

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.750 
good to go so let that dry I'm gonna run
out<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.319> keep<00:03:52.590> these<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.750> I'll<00:03:55.290> be<00:03:55.410> back

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
out and keep these and I'll be back

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.819 
out and keep these and I'll be back
we're<00:03:56.760> basket<00:03:57.180> everything<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.959> painted<00:03:58.230> here

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
we're basket everything is painted here

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.629 
we're basket everything is painted here
is<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.829> pushpins<00:04:01.829> which<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.280> gonna<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.549> the

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
is the pushpins which is gonna be the

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.940 
is the pushpins which is gonna be the
middle<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> flower<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:04.500> all<00:04:04.620> dry<00:04:04.920> I

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
middle of the flower and it's all dry I

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.009 
middle of the flower and it's all dry I
spray<00:04:05.459> painted<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:05.940> black<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.630> then<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.810> did<00:04:06.989> a

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
spray painted it black and then I did a

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.979 
spray painted it black and then I did a
spritz<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.709> like<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.040> gold<00:04:08.370> glitter<00:04:08.730> on<00:04:09.720> there

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
spritz of like a gold glitter on there

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.770 
spritz of like a gold glitter on there
as<00:04:10.139> well<00:04:10.280> when<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.370> paint<00:04:11.639> wasn't<00:04:12.000> quite<00:04:12.329> 100

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
as well when the paint wasn't quite 100

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.449 
as well when the paint wasn't quite 100
percent<00:04:13.019> dry<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.639> here<00:04:14.639> are<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:16.019> petals<00:04:16.459> so

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
percent dry and here are the petals so

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.349 
percent dry and here are the petals so
all<00:04:17.609> I'm<00:04:17.700> gonna<00:04:17.849> do<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.919> put<00:04:19.919> them<00:04:20.070> together

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
all I'm gonna do is put them together

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.750 
all I'm gonna do is put them together
and<00:04:21.359> figure<00:04:21.930> out<00:04:21.989> how<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.260> want<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.680> then<00:04:23.370> take

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
and figure out how you want it then take

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.990 
and figure out how you want it then take
the<00:04:24.090> very<00:04:24.720> strong<00:04:25.020> glue<00:04:25.760> squeeze<00:04:26.760> them

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
the very strong glue squeeze them

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.370 
the very strong glue squeeze them
between<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.479> two<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:27.960> don't<00:04:28.169> really

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
between the two and you don't really

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.930 
between the two and you don't really
need<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.680> bunch<00:04:29.039> of<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:29.700> need<00:04:29.880> enough

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
need a bunch of it you just need enough

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.750 
need a bunch of it you just need enough
for<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.479> tough<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:31.650> catch<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.310> stick

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
for a tough to catch and stick

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.520 
for a tough to catch and stick
and<00:04:35.270> squeeze<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:35.960> all<00:04:36.110> together<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:39.110> then<00:04:39.380> it

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
and squeeze it all together and then it

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.050 
and squeeze it all together and then it
should<00:04:39.770> come<00:04:40.130> together<00:04:40.340> pretty<00:04:40.760> well<00:04:43.060> and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
should come together pretty well and

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.030 
should come together pretty well and
there<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.300> go<00:04:44.860> now<00:04:45.860> what<00:04:46.040> you're<00:04:46.160> gonna<00:04:46.280> do<00:04:46.550> is
