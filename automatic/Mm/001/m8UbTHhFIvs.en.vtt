00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.580
 2 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.560
 well it him everyone knows nec 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.260
 case and we end up today with 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 a map but how to say a map 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.650
 grandiose an exceptional map while there 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.300
 you say he's in a little house 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.130
 wood what's going on but well if 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 you read the title of the map you 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.640
 know where I am I find myself in the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.989
 link house so I broke a little 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.690
 block but I realized it because 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.650
 in quarters the video started and so I 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.059
 find me in the house of line 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.300
 because it's just the map 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.089
 of ocarina of time that has been recreated so 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.650
 it's just totally hallucinating those 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.960
 who know who knows the game 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.110
 ocarina of time so on nintendo 64 is 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.460
 also 3ds low are simply going 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.860
 recognize the places pretty quickly 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.479
 so we find in the village kokiri 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.860
 the early village and it's totally 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.950
 hallucinating the work that was done 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.420
 so it was created by benoÃ®t 334 and 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.590
 it's a basic pessah map that has been 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.510
 converted by two who 98 89 and that's 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.409
 just amazing when the work that has 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.860
 been done on this map 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.299
 so just i think the map the map 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.100
 is not complete in fact because 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.000
 ball passed not entirely safe on 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.760
 xbox 360 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.470
 because it's so impressive 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.480
 so big this carennac world them 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 they could not just transcribe it 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.500
 but there are so many places already 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.060
 that they are who are visitable that I 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.920
 I wanted wanted to show you everything 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.260
 just because I discovered 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.270
 this map but I bow to hockey there 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.470
 the guys did a taf taff of sare because 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 you're going to see everything that was 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.350
 reproduced so here we will arrive in the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.840
 plain of hyrule for those who 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.640
 recall the first ride to 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.620
 horse that we could do in this 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.880
 plain that was just actually very 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.200
 small in the end when we look at it 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.400
 now today with all the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.750
 others I condemn but who we 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.800
 seemed so big at the time 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.050
 is so impressive 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.560
 there we have the ranch so I think that 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.180
 it's their den 11 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.380
 I am a more exactly I believe that 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.990
 this is the important thing this game I do them 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.100
 I redid but I still have 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.840
 little oversights which is a small block 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.280
 of ice the aquilon ticket we go 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.140
 remove 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.060
 and so here I am going to show you too 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.230
 the castle and because yes because he 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.880
 is impressive too but everything is 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.739
 impressive on this map and I you 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.910
 will leave the pleasure of discovering the 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.650
 stay on the other hand I do not want you 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.300
 spoil the pleasure like me 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.200
 have had in discovering the map 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.640
 because you also have him loose 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.739
 cocorico that's right there that was 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.630
 redo the village goron quai just at 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.459
 above that they were too 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.260
 completely redone finally brief here you are 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.299
 have all the places of this zelda ocarina 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.140
 of time who are here who are present 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.799
 but which are impressive 2 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.519
 how to say no and realism 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.260
 impressive as it was well 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.900
 redo it is just missing the pnj what that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.430
 lack a little life it's just that but 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.810
 if you want the world of karine of 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.450
 time if you think of creating an adventure 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.420
 in this world of karine of time it can 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.950
 to be quite bad already to have this world 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.090
 totally realized and then great 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.440
 realized 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.640
 this is especially so we have them 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.650
 castle grills the famous grids 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.239
 from the castle where we had to go around on 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.680
 the sides at the time I remember for 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.060
 to be able to go in because the guy does 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.829
 we do not let in if I say no 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.510
 nonsense and there we shoot down the castle 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.340
 hyrule simply and we also 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.519
 its small gardens as in the castle 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.810
 of hyrule where we had to hide we played 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.450
 a little hidden cache with the guys 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.620
 from here for those who made the game 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.010
 so that's just awesome 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.500
 work that was done here the window 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.299
 the window or zelda look looks 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.489
 ganon i think it's ganon she 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.959
 look at that moment and we discover 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.650
 zelda for the first time here in this 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.329
 little garden 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.450
 in short, it's a world totally 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.400
 amazing that was redone 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.230
 I see there I have nothing else to say about 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.660
 more if not download the map is 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.910
 went to visit go visit this world that 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.050
 it's just it's amazing it's just 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.390
 amazing what they managed to do 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.830
 so it's a converted pc map again 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.200
 once so for sure they have the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.180
 tools the tools to create worlds 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.349
 like that but even with the tools it's 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.420
 still impressive to have 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.980
 respected respect karine map 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.330
 get as I wanted said that 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.620
 seems a bit empty but at the same 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.510
 time the game was also a little bit 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.690
 obvious on nintendo 64 for those who 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.670
 remember it but those tired voices 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.260
 and here is a game I loved to 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.360
 the time I still love so much and 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.340
 that and find the map on 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.810
