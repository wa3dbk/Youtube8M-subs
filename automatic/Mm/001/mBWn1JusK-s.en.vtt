00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.030
 and greet him draw these pitres 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.109
 today a little video I 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.470
 start again 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.449
 I hit again today 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 I did a little drawing because 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 it was the holidays and wanted me 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.340
 to please me I have a little drawing 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 of water drops on a paper and not 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.670
 any early taste since it is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.239
 of an illusion a 3d illusion so a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.180
 optical illusion 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.719
 So this is my second trompe l'oeil 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.430
 my whole life to say and I got 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.379
 really broke on that one so I 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.660
 drawn on semi-dyed paper with a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.620
 mini charcoal and a miner's mine 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.559
 so if you remember well the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.800
 last time I did that with a 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.989
 reverse with a drop shadow 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.680
 this time it will be a material a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 little bit more transparent and it's true 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.960
 that make water is not easy 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.150
 not obvious at all I have not at all 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 the habit of drawing water so that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.880
 change a little bit 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.290
 so here I had already done my 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.090
 manipulation on photoshop 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.250
 so I had the screen in front 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.729
 me and I could draw directly 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.729
 with with the example with the reference 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.730
 so there I worked the stomp for 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.330
 to make small circles of water 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.330
 while the left falls 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.780
 and then I finish with white so 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.770
 it gives a small effect of re 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.420
 interesting on a semi-dyed leaf 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.819
 it's always it's always 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.689
 little effect so here after you can 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:05.360
 try to merge everything is thought 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:09.590
 well wash your stump with a 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.140
 sopalin several times if possible and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.250
 that's what gives it so pretty much the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.019
 size of the drawings so it's pretty 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.110
 great 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.299
 so I cut it all around and I 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.830
 stuck a white table 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.830
 I adjusted the contrast a little 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.330
 post-production and see what it gives 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.640
 with a roughly correct angle that's 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.940
 what it gives is not bad at all 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.380
 for my second think what are you 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.630
 there I come back little bit of water so there 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.090
 the illusion is a little less strong but 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.769
 you saw that it's really not 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.470
 difficult with the tutorial that I you 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.150
 showed last time so I you 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.459
 reminds me that I opened a community 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.420
 google more there is about now 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.370
 two weeks 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.829
 so if you want to post your 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.930
 drawings go there the link is just in 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.160
 below the video on this game will tell you 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.019
 later for new videos 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.019
 and that's bye bye
