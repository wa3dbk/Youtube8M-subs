00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.240
 Welcome to a monday 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.510
 two video I'll show you one today 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.480
 replay because I like you a lot 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.890
 aggressive tactics he with the Terrans 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.600
 want to show and our first opponent 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
 is almost also on terrain too 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 golfer and me again shortly 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.529
 take to get back with short term 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.640
 can say 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.779
 I will introduce you to this tutorial 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.189
 Just show how pretty you are 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.370
 aggressive opening can do so 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.950
 simply aggressive image you could as well 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.700
 I know if you have gameplay 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:49.020
 can not say a plan 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:51.390
 so you do not build a depot at 10 resp 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.390
 So if you have new wwf then 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 he sends a front build as soon as 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.480
 possible a depot but so here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.480
 Continuously still like banks 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 10 should now just a depot and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.330
 then first gas before you then the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.189
 Kaserne Baum will continue to be the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.930
 all the time continuously wwf 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.520
 to produce 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.170
 and as soon as we have the opportunity I 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750
 We believe we produce exactly 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 continue wwf now we should be 150 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.229
 minerals can and have come up here 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.080
 placing the barracks in 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.990
 still continue now as we do 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 one is not very short of one 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 like the us production but that's okay 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.479
 if that is so what is ok of course okay 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.869
 is optimal if it is not so but it 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.850
 is alright then in the case 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.799
 I'll be like that in the other videos too 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 By the way, second depot is at the front 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.710
 you do not have to close it 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 if you play against terraner yes 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.380
 I will definitely be two more 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.570
 I make more videos 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.790
 also imagine an aggressive picture 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.070
 will and once again against tus and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.549
 once against sehar each we play 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.049
 always with the Terrans and there 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.430
 picture with me lately quite good 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.790
 I have decided to work 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.600
 you also participate in it and 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.590
 then you can do it all the time 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.129
 try out 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.679
 so also went on break so briefly in the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.650
 At the moment we have the two depots 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.790
 the thing finished and now here too 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.019
 that's exactly what I forgot to 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.980
 say sorry if we have the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.989
 have completed the gas station here 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.680
 Refinery then please immediately three babies 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.390
 purely so that we once the barracks ready 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.340
 be at the factory as soon as possible 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.280
 can build 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.810
 as soon as we have 50 gas again 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.340
 Now we will put the reactor to work 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.819
 to the barracks that allows us the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.319
 double production of yes no matter if space 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.709
 marines now here or in this case 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.000
 maybe I'll need harry 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.760
 now have the gas here just once 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.500
 continued so we wait until the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.920
 factory finished I want to be very short 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.920
 a little bit ahead 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.470
 and yes we wait until the reactor 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.140
 finished like switches then the factory 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.280
 with the barracks in between, of course 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.720
 also the official command I know it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 not exactly when I suggest it 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.630
 I also researched that one 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.910
 we're good at jumping 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.130
 Shortly back we build the depot 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:25.709
 Refinery send three wwf stone 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.810
 Barrack factory after the factory immediately 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.650
 the reactor and after the reactor 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.599
 if we wwf for the whole time 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.440
 let's explore the opel- comment 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.510
 here 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.910
 the satellites are central and can 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.380
 however, use so gay before allah 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.500
 as well as the two buildings and wish 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:51.330
 pump now first two men and one 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.280
 space marine and next to two babies now 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.660
 we can go straight to the front 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.110
 now again one or two depots 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.930
 to build 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.220
 depending on how you have to be funny 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.910
 you experiment a bit around 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.920
 how best for you 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.270
 so we feel already two heroes are 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.970
 I finish the rally Poland now 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.210
 of both things to the heroes with it 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:17.370
 everything now continues to run forward 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.470
 and i pump a total of six helens and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.620
 I do not know three four space marines 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.960
 and take the 2 as we do here 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.610
 front with alternative I think so 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.500
 still a third wbf with forward 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.690
 Immediately see the sky 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.550
 we will do 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.290
 the bbfc two take the front the 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.390
 are actually just there for it 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.490
 I can cure the heroine in front if it is 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.370
 because something is needed, of course 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.840
 is required because at the time 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.840
 teheran had most of it already 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.380
 alliance or here how to get space 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.580
 marines so we can actually now 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.930
 from a safe distance agree that the 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.550
 but also the space can 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.400
 marines can change with the 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.020
 baby apps simultaneously heal the aliens 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.600
 that one holds the advantage that the hens 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.830
 die much less quickly 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.740
 at the same time while this is in front 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.600
 happens and the phones from our base 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.550
 move up 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.140
 short break I am with the third wbf 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.810
 here in front right now right here 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.539
 space port can be at the same time 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.220
 I already here and right 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.199
 yes, stop here I have normal 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:27.669
 the second gas still taken quite normal 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:28.960
 so keep playing here once as first 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.970
 the flattened here we see 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.650
 Now that we start the eyes 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.669
 to build a harbor because then we are here 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:41.500
 alternatively produce more directly 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:44.199
 can and will be then as well 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.340
 play already before is yes the wwf 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.770
 I still have them in front with me 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.150
 with it to the attack because I had 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.810
 I saw there that he had no chance 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.310
 has or had too late units 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.960
 it's not always that good 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.800
 you just have to say that before 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.180
 especially if he opponents early on front 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.410
 put it down so yes and here was on 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.070
 this place continues to play too 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.970
 as I said just try and see 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.470
 experimenting a bit around 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.030
 But I think the principle should 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.470
 be clear you can as I said if it is 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.210
 not quite working out or somehow then 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.590
 can you still ben spies here 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.599
 then produce fly over quickly 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.909
 and just put pressure all the time 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.650
 while you rest in the back ex and 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.280
 continue to produce your eco in 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.960
 keep a shot 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.849
 and yes, that was like watching the video 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.960
 I liked the video when I helped 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.759
 or whatever I would be 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:33.310
 very positive but positive 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:34.690
 rating girlfriend comment and now 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.520
 in any case then faded in here 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.659
 also the two other videos against the 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.590
 I show two other races as well 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.810
 everything in the picture 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.789
 and as we say people are pure and 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.139
 until next family face 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.740
 and so on and so forth I hope that 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.860
 I have a chance ok so pure up 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.860
 then
