a good way for the defending team to
flank<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> other<00:01:34.799> team<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.430> by<00:01:35.610> jumping

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
flank the other team is just by jumping

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.910 
flank the other team is just by jumping
down<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.450> attacking<00:01:36.750> them<00:01:37.140> from<00:01:37.500> behind

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.890 

yeah<00:01:43.370> once<00:01:44.370> again<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.910> dad<00:01:45.090> spots<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:45.720> our

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
yeah once again your dad spots that our

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.360 
yeah once again your dad spots that our
team<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> stuck<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:47.100> difficult

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
team is stuck in a very difficult

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.670 
team is stuck in a very difficult
showdown<00:01:47.970> over<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.510> and<00:01:48.660> he<00:01:49.320> makes<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
showdown over here and he makes the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.860 
showdown over here and he makes the
smart<00:01:50.070> move<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.400> just<00:01:50.640> jumping<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:51.120> sneaking

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
smart move of just jumping down sneaking

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.720 
smart move of just jumping down sneaking
up<00:01:51.990> behind<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.440> enemy<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.950> he<00:01:53.010> does<00:01:53.460> haven't

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
up behind the enemy and he does haven't

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.070 
up behind the enemy and he does haven't
have<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> shotgun<00:01:54.300> but<00:01:54.480> he<00:01:54.720> probably<00:01:54.900> could

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
have a shotgun but he probably could

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.480 
have a shotgun but he probably could
have<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.320> assassinated<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.950> guy<00:01:56.100> anyways

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
have just assassinated the guy anyways

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.430 
have just assassinated the guy anyways
and<00:01:56.730> he's<00:01:57.390> able<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.750> take<00:01:57.930> him<00:01:58.050> out<00:01:58.230> for

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
and he's able to take him out for

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.040 
and he's able to take him out for
another<00:01:58.920> easy<00:01:59.190> kill<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> your<00:02:00.390> dad<00:02:00.540> does<00:02:00.810> make

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
another easy kill and your dad does make

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.840 
another easy kill and your dad does make
some<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.470> nice<00:02:01.710> moves<00:02:02.010> this<00:02:02.220> game<00:02:02.430> he<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
some very nice moves this game he is a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
some very nice moves this game he is a
sneaky<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.780> boy<00:02:04.070> obviously<00:02:05.070> we're<00:02:05.190> not

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
sneaky little boy obviously we're not

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950 
sneaky little boy obviously we're not
covering<00:02:05.550> all<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.910> flanking<00:02:06.420> points<00:02:06.810> on

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
covering all the flanking points on

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
covering all the flanking points on
sword<00:02:07.350> base<00:02:07.410> because<00:02:08.009> all<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> these<00:02:08.429> occurred

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
sword base because all of these occurred

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.639 
sword base because all of these occurred
in<00:02:08.910> one<00:02:09.090> game<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.720> there's<00:02:10.080> probably<00:02:10.200> some

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
in one game so there's probably some

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
in one game so there's probably some
other<00:02:10.679> possibilities<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.670> could<00:02:11.820> have<00:02:11.940> been

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
other possibilities that could have been

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.270 
other possibilities that could have been
done<00:02:12.240> but<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.290> didn't<00:02:13.560> get<00:02:13.650> around<00:02:13.770> doing

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
done but we just didn't get around doing

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.130 
done but we just didn't get around doing
it<00:02:14.459> with<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.820> 50<00:02:15.120> kills<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.600> we<00:02:15.690> had<00:02:15.900> all

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it with the 50 kills that we had all

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.350 
it with the 50 kills that we had all
right<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.680> third<00:02:16.890> flank<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.459> vantage<00:02:18.000> point

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
right the third flank is vantage point

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.300 
right the third flank is vantage point
which<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.690> what<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:18.930> call<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.500> lot<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.160> guys

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
which is what we call it a lot of guys

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.130 
which is what we call it a lot of guys
get<00:02:20.670> off<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.209> little<00:02:21.360> air<00:02:21.630> vent<00:02:21.930> thing

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
get off on that little air vent thing

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.810 
get off on that little air vent thing
and<00:02:22.320> it's<00:02:22.440> very<00:02:22.620> hard<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.190> them<00:02:23.370> down<00:02:23.400> and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
and it's very hard to take them down and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.550 
and it's very hard to take them down and
the<00:02:23.970> best<00:02:24.150> ways<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.170> go<00:02:25.440> up

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the best ways to do it is to go up

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.130 
the best ways to do it is to go up
behind<00:02:25.770> them<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.270> gotta<00:02:27.420> watch<00:02:27.630> vantage

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
behind them but you gotta watch vantage

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.790 
behind them but you gotta watch vantage
point<00:02:28.410> Lance<00:02:28.650> point<00:02:28.950> right<00:02:29.070> now<00:02:33.650> say<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.390 

unfortunately<00:02:40.350> these<00:02:40.530> guys<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.250> me

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400

coming but I'm able to get some shots on

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.280 
coming but I'm able to get some shots on
them<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.860> take<00:02:44.400> them<00:02:44.550> out<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:44.910> ease<00:02:48.230> now<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
them and take them out with ease now the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.320 
them and take them out with ease now the
fifth<00:02:49.590> flank<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.459> very<00:02:50.489> heads-up<00:02:50.940> move

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
fifth flank is just a very heads-up move

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.060 
fifth flank is just a very heads-up move

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
met so he makes a smart move and goes to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.620
