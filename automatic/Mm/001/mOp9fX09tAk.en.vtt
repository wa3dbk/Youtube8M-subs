00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.450 
the intensity of the light for example
if<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.150> solar<00:00:12.420> cell<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.019> I'm<00:00:13.460> applying

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
if I have a solar cell and I'm applying

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.150 
if I have a solar cell and I'm applying
light<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.540> intensity<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.470> son<00:00:16.770> what

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
light with the intensity of one son what

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.550 
light with the intensity of one son what
if<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.490> increase<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> intensity<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.960> light<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
if I increase the intensity of light to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.060 
if I increase the intensity of light to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that to be off ten sons or 100 son what

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250 
that to be off ten sons or 100 son what
would<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.279> do<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.060> efficiency<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.810> for

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
would that do to the efficiency of for

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.700 
would that do to the efficiency of for
this<00:00:25.410> solar<00:00:25.980> cell<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.580> let<00:00:27.570> me<00:00:27.720> start<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
this solar cell so let me start with the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.970 
this solar cell so let me start with the
basics<00:00:29.130> over<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> know<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:31.349> JV

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
basics over here so I know that my JV

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.130 
basics over here so I know that my JV
relationship<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:33.030> solar<00:00:33.329> cell<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.930> be

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
relationship for my solar cell can be

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.880 
relationship for my solar cell can be
expressed<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.930> express<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
expressed as this and I can express the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.270 
expressed as this and I can express the
condition<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.670> open<00:00:39.570> circuit<00:00:39.989> voltage<00:00:40.280> by

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
condition of open circuit voltage by

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940 
condition of open circuit voltage by
equating<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.239> total<00:00:42.719> current<00:00:42.930> equal<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> 0<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
equating the total current equal to 0 so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.869 
equating the total current equal to 0 so
at<00:00:44.129> open<00:00:44.820> circuit<00:00:45.239> condition<00:00:45.530> my<00:00:46.530> j<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.670> my

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
at open circuit condition my j or my

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
at open circuit condition my j or my
current<00:00:48.239> density<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> cell<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.320> equal<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
current density in the cell is equal to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.319 
current density in the cell is equal to
zero<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.600> plug<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:53.460> applied<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.210> be

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
zero so I can plug for we applied to be

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.439 
zero so I can plug for we applied to be
vo<00:00:54.629> C<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:55.920> plug<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> total<00:00:56.699> current<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
vo C and now plug the total current to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.099 
vo C and now plug the total current to
be<00:00:57.570> 0<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.850> condition<00:01:00.480> at

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
be 0 so I will have this condition at

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.060 
be 0 so I will have this condition at
open<00:01:02.100> circuit<00:01:02.609> voltage<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:06.560> basically<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.680> can

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
open circuit voltage and basically I can

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.050 
open circuit voltage and basically I can
then<00:01:08.729> express<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.869> open<00:01:10.500> circuit<00:01:10.710> voltage<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
then express my open circuit voltage in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.899 
then express my open circuit voltage in
terms<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.260> short<00:01:13.890> circuit<00:01:14.130> current<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
terms of this short circuit current and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
terms of this short circuit current and
other<00:01:15.150> parameters<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
other parameters and then I get a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.560 
other parameters and then I get a
formula<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.650> for<00:01:19.650> open<00:01:20.070> circuit<00:01:20.490> voltage<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
formula for for open circuit voltage to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.859 
formula for for open circuit voltage to
be<00:01:21.750> equal<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.880> equal<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.960> KT<00:01:24.960> by<00:01:25.500> Q<00:01:26.600> natural<00:01:27.600> log

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
be equal to equal to KT by Q natural log

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.450 
be equal to equal to KT by Q natural log
of<00:01:28.759> JSC<00:01:29.759> plus<00:01:30.689> J<00:01:31.049> naught<00:01:31.549> divided<00:01:32.549> by<00:01:32.759> JSC<00:01:34.130> /<00:01:35.130> j

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of JSC plus J naught divided by JSC / j

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.260 
of JSC plus J naught divided by JSC / j
naught<00:01:35.670> sorry

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
naught sorry

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.859 
naught sorry
so<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.310> JSC<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.520> short<00:01:39.090> circuit<00:01:39.509> current

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
so this JSC this short circuit current

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.530 
so this JSC this short circuit current
is<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.619> typically<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.250> larger<00:01:41.280> than<00:01:42.030> G

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
is more typically much larger than G

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
is more typically much larger than G
naught<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.829> simplify<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.390> write

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
naught so I can simplify this and write

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.389 
naught so I can simplify this and write
that<00:01:47.329> approximated<00:01:48.329> equal<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.259> KT<00:01:50.100> by<00:01:50.369> Q

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that approximated equal to KT by Q

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.999 
that approximated equal to KT by Q
natural<00:01:51.270> log<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.920> JSC<00:01:52.920> divided<00:01:53.549> by<00:01:53.759> G<00:01:54.329> naught

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
natural log of JSC divided by G naught

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.670 
natural log of JSC divided by G naught
so<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.460> would<00:01:56.640> happen<00:01:57.110> when<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> increase

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so now what would happen when I increase

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.789 
so now what would happen when I increase
the<00:01:58.979> concentration<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.820> my<00:02:00.360> light<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.500> let<00:02:01.649> me

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
the concentration of my light so let me

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.510 
the concentration of my light so let me
think

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
think

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.120 
think
consider<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> case<00:02:03.479> where<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.950> increase<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
consider the case where I increase the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.469 
consider the case where I increase the
concentration<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:06.119> make<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.710> X<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.270> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
concentration and make it to X so if I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.880 
concentration and make it to X so if I
increase<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.170> concentration<00:02:10.550> by<00:02:11.550> 2x<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.450> can

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
increase the concentration by 2x I can

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.040 
increase the concentration by 2x I can
that<00:02:13.220> my<00:02:13.420> short-circuit<00:02:14.420> current<00:02:14.810> will

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
that my short-circuit current will

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.520 
that my short-circuit current will
become<00:02:15.470> 2x<00:02:16.340> as<00:02:16.520> well<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.420> my<00:02:17.569> short-circuit

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
become 2x as well so my short-circuit

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.630 
become 2x as well so my short-circuit
current<00:02:18.950> will<00:02:19.220> become<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:20.480> JSC<00:02:20.900> as<00:02:21.170> well<00:02:21.640> but

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
current will become to JSC as well but

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.460 
current will become to JSC as well but
what<00:02:23.000> would<00:02:23.150> happen<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.660> open<00:02:24.020> circuit

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
what would happen to the open circuit

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.190 
what would happen to the open circuit
voltage<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:26.200> interesting

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
voltage so that is interesting

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.280 
voltage so that is interesting
relationship<00:02:28.100> which<00:02:28.690> emerges<00:02:29.690> from<00:02:29.990> this

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
relationship which emerges from this

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.850 
relationship which emerges from this
formula<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.520> derived<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.900> what<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.290> see<00:02:33.650> is

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
formula that I derived so what I see is

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.150 
formula that I derived so what I see is
that<00:02:34.070> if<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.610> increase<00:02:34.880> my<00:02:35.260> open<00:02:36.260> circuit<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:37.010> I

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
that if I increase my open circuit if I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.100 
that if I increase my open circuit if I
increase<00:02:37.520> my<00:02:37.550> short-circuit<00:02:38.450> current<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:38.989> if

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
increase my short-circuit current so if

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.830 
increase my short-circuit current so if
I<00:02:39.260> increase<00:02:39.590> my<00:02:40.030> short<00:02:41.030> circuit<00:02:41.390> current<00:02:41.750> and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
I increase my short circuit current and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.729 
I increase my short circuit current and
make<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.650> twice<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.760> make<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.239> twice<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.590> what<00:02:45.709> I

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
make it twice I make it twice so what I

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.920 
make it twice I make it twice so what I
see<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.160> my<00:02:46.520> open<00:02:46.910> circuit<00:02:47.300> voltage<00:02:47.330> will

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
see is that my open circuit voltage will

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.280 
see is that my open circuit voltage will
also<00:02:48.320> increase<00:02:48.620> but<00:02:49.100> not<00:02:49.400> linearly<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.600> much

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
also increase but not linearly but much

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.220 
also increase but not linearly but much
slowly<00:02:51.620> with<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.150> logarithmic<00:02:53.150> dependence<00:02:53.540> on

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
slowly with a logarithmic dependence on

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.620 
slowly with a logarithmic dependence on
the<00:02:54.410> short-circuit<00:02:54.860> current<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:56.150> what<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.330> see

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
the short-circuit current so what I see

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.380 
the short-circuit current so what I see
is<00:02:56.810> not<00:02:56.840> only<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.620> my<00:02:58.000> short-circuit<00:02:59.000> current

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
is not only is my short-circuit current

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.009 
is not only is my short-circuit current
in<00:02:59.959> improving<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.580> there<00:03:01.850> is<00:03:01.970> also<00:03:02.300> increase

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
in improving but there is also increase

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.620 
in improving but there is also increase
in<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.500> open<00:03:03.860> circuit<00:03:04.250> voltage<00:03:04.280> which<00:03:04.910> comes

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
in the open circuit voltage which comes

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.500 
in the open circuit voltage which comes
out<00:03:05.930> from<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.410> from<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.280> JV<00:03:07.880> relationship

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
out from this from this JV relationship

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570 
out from this from this JV relationship
so<00:03:09.230> what<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.380> will<00:03:09.530> see<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:10.010> instead<00:03:10.340> of

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
so what I will see is that instead of

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.729 
so what I will see is that instead of
having<00:03:11.330> vo<00:03:12.140> say<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:12.470> see<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.130> vo<00:03:14.090> C<00:03:14.450> plus<00:03:14.810> Delta<00:03:15.080> as

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
having vo say I see a vo C plus Delta as

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.270 
having vo say I see a vo C plus Delta as
my<00:03:16.220> as<00:03:16.640> plus<00:03:17.600> Delta<00:03:18.049> V<00:03:18.079> as<00:03:18.410> my<00:03:18.680> open<00:03:19.100> circuit

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
my as plus Delta V as my open circuit

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.020 
my as plus Delta V as my open circuit
voltage<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.900> my<00:03:21.049> new<00:03:21.290> IV<00:03:21.799> relationship<00:03:22.730> would

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
voltage so my new IV relationship would

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.150 
voltage so my new IV relationship would
essentially<00:03:23.480> look<00:03:23.870> something<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:24.739> this

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
essentially look something like this

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.610 
essentially look something like this
where<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.760> slight<00:03:26.570> increase<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:27.170> my

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
where I have a slight increase in my

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.720 
where I have a slight increase in my
view<00:03:27.890> cl1<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:30.079> can<00:03:30.620> assume<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.519> know<00:03:31.640> I'll

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
view cl1 and can assume you know I'll

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.330 
view cl1 and can assume you know I'll
make<00:03:31.970> approximation<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.989> my<00:03:33.200> fill<00:03:33.590> factor<00:03:33.829> R

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
make approximation that my fill factor R

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.940 
make approximation that my fill factor R
remains<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.940> same<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.049> can<00:03:36.170> write<00:03:36.920> my

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
remains the same so I can write my

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.640 
remains the same so I can write my
efficiency<00:03:37.700> as<00:03:38.530> essentially<00:03:39.530> my<00:03:41.170> JSC<00:03:42.200> times

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
efficiency as essentially my JSC times

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.680 
efficiency as essentially my JSC times
my<00:03:43.160> vo<00:03:43.880> C<00:03:44.410> divided<00:03:45.410> by<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.680> incident<00:03:46.250> power<00:03:46.880> so

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
my vo C divided by the incident power so

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.949 
my vo C divided by the incident power so
when<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.170> increase<00:03:48.799> my<00:03:48.850> concentration<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.180> 2x<00:03:50.660> I

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
when I increase my concentration to 2x I

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.620 
when I increase my concentration to 2x I
will<00:03:51.200> get<00:03:51.410> essentially<00:03:51.950> twice<00:03:52.610> increase<00:03:53.360> in

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
will get essentially twice increase in

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.259 
will get essentially twice increase in
my<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.170> short-circuit<00:03:54.980> current<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.610> get<00:03:56.239> a

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
my and short-circuit current I get a

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.740 
my and short-circuit current I get a
twice<00:03:56.660> increase<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.590> my<00:03:57.799> incident<00:03:58.549> power<00:03:58.850> but

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
twice increase in my incident power but

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.740 
twice increase in my incident power but
I<00:03:59.780> see<00:04:00.320> my<00:04:00.650> vo<00:04:01.070> C<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.640> also<00:04:02.150> now<00:04:02.360> slightly

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
I see my vo C is also now slightly

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.020 
I see my vo C is also now slightly
increased<00:04:03.350> as<00:04:03.620> given<00:04:04.100> by<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.340> relationship

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
increased as given by this relationship

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.170 
increased as given by this relationship
so<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.480> will<00:04:05.720> get<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.900> vo<00:04:06.260> C<00:04:06.560> plus<00:04:06.890> this<00:04:07.400> delta

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
so I will get a vo C plus this delta

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.470 
so I will get a vo C plus this delta
increase<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.049> vo<00:04:09.230> C<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:10.310> my<00:04:10.459> efficiency<00:04:11.180> if

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
increase in the vo C so my efficiency if

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.410 
increase in the vo C so my efficiency if
I<00:04:11.630> compare<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.109> as<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.620> concentration<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.670> one

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
I compare it as a concentration of one

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.199 
I compare it as a concentration of one
son<00:04:14.750> versus<00:04:15.320> if<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.669> compare<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.820> efficiency

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.900 
son versus if I compare the efficiency

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
at the concentration of to send I see

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.200 
at the concentration of to send I see
that<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.450> see<00:04:21.070> increase<00:04:22.070> in<00:04:22.099> my<00:04:22.460> efficiency<00:04:23.000> so

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
that I see increase in my efficiency so

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.710 
that I see increase in my efficiency so
what<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.599> analysis<00:04:24.500> is<00:04:24.650> suggesting<00:04:25.220> is<00:04:25.370> that

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
what this analysis is suggesting is that

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.800 
what this analysis is suggesting is that
my<00:04:26.160> efficiency<00:04:27.160> increases<00:04:28.000> as<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.300> increase

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
my efficiency increases as I increase

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.710 
my efficiency increases as I increase
the<00:04:29.320> concentration<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.310> light<00:04:30.570> but<00:04:31.570> there

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
the concentration of the light but there

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.930 
the concentration of the light but there
are<00:04:31.810> some<00:04:32.050> caveats<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:32.890> so<00:04:33.310> what<00:04:33.730> I<00:04:33.760> have

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
are some caveats to this so what I have

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.260 
are some caveats to this so what I have
assumed<00:04:34.420> in<00:04:34.810> this<00:04:35.050> analysis<00:04:35.920> is<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.270> my

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
assumed in this analysis is that my

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.600 
assumed in this analysis is that my
temperature<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.260> cell<00:04:38.500> did<00:04:38.890> not<00:04:39.100> away

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
temperature of the cell did not away

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.400 
temperature of the cell did not away
typically<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.510> have<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.780> very<00:04:41.200> large

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
typically if you have a very large

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.180 
typically if you have a very large
current<00:04:42.190> flowing<00:04:42.520> or<00:04:42.760> if<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.910> have<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.180> large

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190
