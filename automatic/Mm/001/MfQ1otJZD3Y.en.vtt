 fascinating life of our friend 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.250
 welcome to england abide hill 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.530
 we are living a nice summer though 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.240
 it's raining a bit outside we should 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.100
 wait for the time to improve 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.830
 to go out and have fun with motorcycles 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.390
 while I can tell you a little about me 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.170
 history and the vincent brand 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 basically 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.720
 I am the youngest of six men and two 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.250
 women and unfortunately most 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 they are no longer 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.230
 I am already 72 years old I grew up with my brothers 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.629
 and with the bikes at age 6 I started 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.340
 run with thom one of my brothers 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.230
 time later I was able to start studying 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.299
 engineering I went to a college 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.819
 engineering and then I came back from the 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.099
 university as a qualified engineer 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.769
 I got my first bike at 16 years old 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.890
 It was a royal enfield 125 centimeters 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.019
 cubic a small motorbike I spent every 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.970
 one of my coins on that bike I think 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.220
 that cost me about 10 pounds and I know 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.069
 I bought my brother tom so that was 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.349
 my first motorcycle they are in shadow 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.049
 face this is an advance black shadow 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.269
 standard this is the type of motorcycle with the 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.040
 that I started running I did some 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.319
 races in the traditional circuit of 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.569
 speed of silverstone then I got 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.489
 in what are the and scholarships so 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:26.739
 we put one together with my brother with a 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:29.349
 sidecar that was taken out in 1918 mosaic 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.350
 pre what was translated very similar to 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.240
 this was a normal motorcycle but this is 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.430
 a motorcycle vincent basically 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.020
 because it has only one piece on the spine and 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.020
 grab the fork and the engine 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.910
 the engine goes on the chassis is a 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.910
 Traditional classic bike race 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.980
 and spain on this bike builds it in 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.920
 the year 2001 and it was made specifically 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.170
 to accelerate in straight lines now 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.720
 for racing the sidecar must be able 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.060
 take two people so what 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.800
 ideal was to go in this place can see 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.090
 how Eddie goes up and how is it 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.090
 drive to go faster 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.970
 and you're crazy what are you doing there, you're just going 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.640
 straight line how was the first time 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.820
 you were well was very exciting 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.340
 because you're going really fast more than 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.930
 what you can imagine is very difficult 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.100
 hold the position because the speed 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.100
 it takes you back 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.470
 and besides I can not see anything, I just move 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.530
 up and down but I can not 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.880
 see nothing is all for today and I tell you that 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.880
 win because it 's the last time 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.280
 and here in this place is my place of 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.009
 work here is where I decide my 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.780
 next speed projects and now 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.520
 we need a bigger place to 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.910
 build this bike that is pretty 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.430
 jim long my friend who is a builder not 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.800
 is going to do he said jim I need more 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.800
 space here he flies it all 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.520
 and already made a new roof in 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.380
 polycarbonate a while ago in fact already 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.490
 I have all the components for this 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.020
 new motorbike 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.480
 you have to put it together and you're ready to 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.980
 paint once painted and start to 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.980
 work with the rest of the team 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.110
 spring here is the dynamometer where 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.050
 all fluids are measured 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.820
 everything manufactured at home and everything is 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.889
 connected to the computer system that 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.789
 it's there 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.789
 s 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:26.060
 It's very noisy and the neighbors should be 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:30.009
 very happy has now seen much 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.009
 they should move the whole house ha ha 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.680
 This really is the place where 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.510
 does the most serious work where it 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.090
 does everything that is electronic and motor 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.330
 Each component of the motorcycle is manufactured 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.330
 here 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.620
 let's hope I can win again 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.960
 the record you got last year and 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.630
 maybe we are here with you 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.740
 that would be awesome we will keep 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.740
 in contact then 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.710
 now
