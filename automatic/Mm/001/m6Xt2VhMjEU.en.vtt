00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.530 

see<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.560> can't<00:02:42.800> see<00:02:43.010> anything<00:02:43.489> my<00:02:44.180> mirror<00:02:44.450> is

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
see you can't see anything my mirror is

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.880 
see you can't see anything my mirror is
kind<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.780> far<00:02:45.080> but<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.430> cap<00:02:46.670> starts<00:02:47.239> here

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
kind of far but on the cap starts here

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.910 
kind of far but on the cap starts here
so<00:02:48.890> don't<00:02:49.069> know<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:49.580> see<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.000> but

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
so don't know you can see that but

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.229 
so don't know you can see that but
that's<00:02:51.920> how<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.130> was<00:02:52.250> living<00:02:52.580> with<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:52.910> hair

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
that's how I was living with this hair

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.320 
that's how I was living with this hair
and<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.650> kind<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:54.980> wrap<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.370> hair<00:02:55.580> around<00:02:55.610> on

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
and you kind of wrap the hair around on

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.570 
and you kind of wrap the hair around on
I<00:02:56.660> could<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.290> just<00:02:57.709> believe<00:02:57.950> my<00:02:58.099> twist<00:02:58.430> like

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
I could I just believe my twist like

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.400 
I could I just believe my twist like
this<00:02:58.640> because<00:02:59.150> throughout<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.510> day<00:02:59.660> my<00:03:00.230> hair

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
this because throughout the day my hair

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.960 
this because throughout the day my hair
gets<00:03:00.620> frizzy<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.250> then<00:03:01.400> eventually<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
gets frizzy and then eventually the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.940 
gets frizzy and then eventually the
twist<00:03:02.239> will<00:03:02.390> loosen<00:03:02.599> up<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.140> then<00:03:03.620> become

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
twist will loosen up and then become

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.860 
twist will loosen up and then become
more<00:03:04.250> realistic<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.300> can<00:03:05.450> see<00:03:05.569> how<00:03:05.690> my

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
more realistic so you can see how my

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.720 
more realistic so you can see how my
hair<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.110> wrapped<00:03:06.410> around<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:07.040> leaf<00:03:07.400> right

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
hair is wrapped around the leaf right

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.670 
hair is wrapped around the leaf right
here<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.569> I've<00:03:08.690> mentioned<00:03:08.870> look<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.410> one

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
here that I've mentioned look like one

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.580 
here that I've mentioned look like one
big<00:03:09.890> piece<00:03:10.190> right<00:03:10.880> throughout<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.360> day<00:03:11.590> not

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
big piece right throughout the day not

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.410 
big piece right throughout the day not
as<00:03:12.709> far<00:03:12.980> as<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.489> side<00:03:13.819> goes<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.299> don't

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
as far as this side goes you don't

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.949 
as far as this side goes you don't
really<00:03:14.630> have<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.019> twist<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.830> around<00:03:15.980> nothing<00:03:16.670> I

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
really have to twist it around nothing I

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.930 
really have to twist it around nothing I
just<00:03:17.959> kind<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.140> leave<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:18.380> loose<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.700> can

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
just kind of leave it loose so you can

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.490 
just kind of leave it loose so you can
see<00:03:20.090> how<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:20.989> case<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.350> wind

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
see how that is so in case the wind

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.920 
see how that is so in case the wind
blows<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.950> just<00:03:22.130> don't<00:03:22.310> see<00:03:22.489> nothing<00:03:22.910> next<00:03:23.810> if

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
blows you just don't see nothing next if

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.780 
blows you just don't see nothing next if
you<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:24.290> um<00:03:24.590> don't<00:03:25.099> mind<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.489> piece

like I said in my last video I don't
have<00:03:38.870> hair<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.410> these<00:03:39.680> areas<00:03:40.190> that's<00:03:41.000> how<00:03:41.209> I

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
have hair in these areas that's how I

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.810 
have hair in these areas that's how I
was<00:03:41.420> born<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.410> kind<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.709> got<00:03:42.859> a<00:03:42.890> manipulating

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
was born so I kind of got a manipulating

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.220 
was born so I kind of got a manipulating
and<00:03:43.970> make<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.269> look<00:03:44.390> like<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.660> got<00:03:44.780> edges<00:03:45.109> right

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
and make it look like I got edges right

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.610 
and make it look like I got edges right
there<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.690> kind<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:47.930> pull<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.320> piece

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
there so I just kind of pull that piece

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:57.130 
there so I just kind of pull that piece
to<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.040> front<00:03:49.370> like<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.549> can<00:03:52.760> see<00:03:56.140> so

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
to the front like that so you can see so

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.620 
to the front like that so you can see so
that's<00:03:57.350> typically<00:03:57.829> how<00:03:58.060> blend<00:03:59.060> my<00:03:59.239> hair<00:03:59.480> at

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
that's typically how blend my hair at

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.479 
that's typically how blend my hair at
this<00:03:59.780> type<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.200> current<00:04:00.500> pattern<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.310> this

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
this type of current pattern and this

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.539 
this type of current pattern and this
was<00:04:01.730> it's<00:04:01.940> like<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.090> loose<00:04:02.450> curly<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.549> using

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
was it's like a loose curly and using

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.890 
was it's like a loose curly and using
all<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.970> products<00:04:05.299> that<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.480> use<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.840> a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
all the products that I use in a

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.900 
all the products that I use in a
previous<00:04:06.290> video<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:07.160> see<00:04:07.280> how<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.549> gives<00:04:07.700> me

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
previous video you see how it gives me

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.539 
previous video you see how it gives me
that<00:04:07.940> illusion<00:04:08.450> on<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.200> Hix<00:04:09.500> gives<00:04:10.250> me<00:04:10.400> that

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
that illusion on that Hix gives me that

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.569 
that illusion on that Hix gives me that
sheen<00:04:10.940> in<00:04:11.389> that<00:04:11.600> set<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.170> power<00:04:12.380> power<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.430> it

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
sheen in that set and power power so it

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.750 
sheen in that set and power power so it
doesn't<00:04:13.910> really<00:04:14.000> budge<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:14.750> frizz<00:04:14.989> up<00:04:15.760> the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
doesn't really budge and frizz up the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.270 
doesn't really budge and frizz up the
black<00:04:17.269> jamaican<00:04:17.780> castor<00:04:18.229> oil<00:04:18.320> just<00:04:18.829> gives<00:04:19.070> me

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
black jamaican castor oil just gives me

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.849 
black jamaican castor oil just gives me
that<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.940> know<00:04:20.060> that<00:04:20.239> Shane<00:04:20.600> on<00:04:20.780> my<00:04:20.900> edges<00:04:21.380> so

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
that you know that Shane on my edges so

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.409 
that you know that Shane on my edges so
they<00:04:21.979> won't<00:04:22.070> look<00:04:22.310> dry<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.880> then<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.389> course

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
they won't look dry and then of course

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.420 
they won't look dry and then of course
the<00:04:23.780> mole<00:04:23.990> sets<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.440> hair<00:04:24.620> really<00:04:24.770> well<00:04:24.919> and

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
the mole sets the hair really well and

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.360 
the mole sets the hair really well and
the<00:04:26.240> grease<00:04:26.510> is<00:04:26.720> just<00:04:26.960> like<00:04:27.919> putting<00:04:28.070> grease

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
the grease is just like putting grease

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.580 
the grease is just like putting grease
on<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.660> kind<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:29.930> helps<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:30.320> stick

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
on it so it kind of helps it stick

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.279 
on it so it kind of helps it stick
better<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:31.190> sum<00:04:31.520> all<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:32.330> process<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.690> use<00:04:32.960> are

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
better to sum all the process I use are

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.040 
better to sum all the process I use are
great<00:04:34.070> for<00:04:34.220> your<00:04:34.370> hair<00:04:34.669> they<00:04:35.389> promote<00:04:35.690> growth

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
great for your hair they promote growth

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.080 
great for your hair they promote growth
supposedly<00:04:36.680> except<00:04:37.220> for<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.550> moves<00:04:37.940> the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
supposedly except for the moves the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.940 
supposedly except for the moves the
mousse<00:04:38.240> doesn't<00:04:38.570> do<00:04:38.660> anything<00:04:38.960> like<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.169> but

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
mousse doesn't do anything like that but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.680 
mousse doesn't do anything like that but
that's<00:04:40.340> how<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:41.830> believe<00:04:42.830> my<00:04:43.130> hair<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.360> this<00:04:44.510> is

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
that's how I believe my hair so this is

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.620 
that's how I believe my hair so this is
how<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:45.200> looks

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
how it looks

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.610 
how it looks
looked<00:04:47.630> out<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.289> on

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
looked out and on

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.890 
looked out and on
like<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.640> said<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:50.940> gotta<00:04:51.120> keep<00:04:51.330> playing<00:04:51.660> with

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
like I said you gotta keep playing with

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.860 
like I said you gotta keep playing with
it<00:04:58.760> like<00:04:59.760> I<00:04:59.850> said<00:04:59.910> you<00:05:00.120> have<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.390> keep<00:05:00.600> playing

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
it like I said you have to keep playing

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.990 
it like I said you have to keep playing
with<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.230> but<00:05:01.680> for<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.100> most<00:05:02.160> part<00:05:02.430> it's<00:05:02.940> like

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
with it but for the most part it's like

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
with it but for the most part it's like
completely<00:05:03.600> blended<00:05:04.880> that's<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.270> sounds

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
completely blended that's that sounds

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.450 
completely blended that's that sounds
like<00:05:07.290> a<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:08.280> call<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.790> Spanish<00:05:09.210> type<00:05:09.450> wave

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
like a you call it a Spanish type wave

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.030 
like a you call it a Spanish type wave
but<00:05:11.460> um<00:05:11.930> that's<00:05:12.930> how<00:05:13.140> it<00:05:13.290> look<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:16.620> see

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
but um that's how it look so you see

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:31.180 
but um that's how it look so you see
these<00:05:17.100> like<00:05:17.370> all<00:05:17.550> blended

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.720 

this<00:05:31.970> is<00:05:32.180> this<00:05:32.360> time<00:05:35.920> now<00:05:36.920> you<00:05:36.980> see<00:05:37.280> why<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.460> put

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
this is this time now you see why I put

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.520 
this is this time now you see why I put
the<00:05:37.880> bigger<00:05:38.120> rollers<00:05:38.630> on<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.020> neck<00:05:39.230> side

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
the bigger rollers on the neck side

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.210 
the bigger rollers on the neck side
because<00:05:39.920> I<00:05:40.190> need<00:05:40.460> bigger<00:05:40.760> curls<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.990> fall<00:05:42.230> into

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
because I need bigger curls to fall into

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.890 
because I need bigger curls to fall into
this<00:05:43.400> out<00:05:43.640> of<00:05:43.760> my<00:05:43.850> head<00:05:44.090> more<00:05:44.330> so<00:05:44.540> than<00:05:44.690> this

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
this out of my head more so than this

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.500 
this out of my head more so than this
side<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:45.770> I<00:05:45.830> may<00:05:46.340> have<00:05:46.550> to<00:05:46.700> go<00:05:46.880> even<00:05:47.420> though

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
side so I may have to go even though

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.260 
side so I may have to go even though
size<00:05:47.930> bigger<00:05:48.380> or<00:05:48.650> don't<00:05:48.890> wrap<00:05:49.130> it<00:05:49.310> as<00:05:49.430> tightly

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
size bigger or don't wrap it as tightly

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.030 
size bigger or don't wrap it as tightly
with<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.810> big<00:05:51.080> ones<00:05:51.320> because<00:05:51.500> you<00:05:51.680> want<00:05:51.980> to

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
with the big ones because you want to

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.100

with my part too much because it will

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.050 
with my part too much because it will
definitely<00:06:12.320> spread<00:06:13.010> throughout<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.640> day<00:06:13.790> and
