huge<00:02:51.070> compared<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:51.730> my<00:02:52.030> credit<00:02:52.330> rail<00:02:52.630> extreme

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
huge compared to my credit rail extreme

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.230 
huge compared to my credit rail extreme
and<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.950> took<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.250> slide<00:02:54.520> out<00:02:54.550> because<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
and I took the slide out because the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.530 
and I took the slide out because the
slide<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:55.600> taking<00:02:55.960> up<00:02:55.990> too<00:02:56.200> much<00:02:56.650> room<00:02:57.540> but

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
slide was taking up too much room but

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.080 
slide was taking up too much room but
other<00:02:58.750> than<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.050> yeah<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:01.930> oh<00:03:05.070> um

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
other than that yeah this is it oh um

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.220 
other than that yeah this is it oh um
this<00:03:07.090> was<00:03:07.270> supposed<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.630> come<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:07.930> an<00:03:08.020> elbow

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
this was supposed to come with an elbow

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.620 
this was supposed to come with an elbow
tube<00:03:08.650> but<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:09.430> some<00:03:09.580> reason<00:03:09.850> mine<00:03:10.030> didn't<00:03:10.420> it

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
tube but for some reason mine didn't it

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.660 
tube but for some reason mine didn't it
came<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.050> straight<00:03:11.320> tube<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.460> like<00:03:12.640> a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
came of a straight tube which I like a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.640 
came of a straight tube which I like a
lot<00:03:12.790> better<00:03:13.150> because<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.870> would<00:03:14.110> not<00:03:14.230> have<00:03:14.500> been

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
lot better because I would not have been

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.000 
lot better because I would not have been
able<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.940> connect<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.560> if<00:03:17.890> I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
able to to connect it to this if I

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.430 
able to to connect it to this if I
didn't<00:03:18.310> get<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:19.050> straight<00:03:20.050> tube<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:22.720> um<00:03:22.900> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.970 

like<00:03:26.440> how<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.680> taskbar<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.850> half<00:03:28.150> plastic

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
like how the taskbar and half plastic

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.710 
like how the taskbar and half plastic
because<00:03:29.980> then<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.340> attach<00:03:30.730> toys<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.330> this

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
because then I can attach toys like this

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.520 
because then I can attach toys like this
on<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:33.480> think<00:03:34.480> I'm<00:03:34.570> going<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.930> move<00:03:35.500> that

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
on to it I think I'm going to move that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.530 
on to it I think I'm going to move that
toy<00:03:35.980> up<00:03:36.310> here<00:03:36.760> eventually<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.280> 0

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
toy up here eventually but this is 0

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.310 
toy up here eventually but this is 0
whenever<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.660> was<00:03:40.810> putting<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.200> together

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
whenever I was putting this together

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.130 
whenever I was putting this together
this<00:03:41.800> is<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.250> hardest<00:03:42.700> thing<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.120> move<00:03:43.540> at

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
this is the hardest thing to move at

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.390 
this is the hardest thing to move at
least<00:03:44.380> for<00:03:44.560> me<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.770> was<00:03:44.830> it's<00:03:45.130> really

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
least for me it was it's really

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.980 
least for me it was it's really
difficult<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.820> move<00:03:46.030> that's<00:03:46.600> why<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.780> haven't

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
difficult to move that's why I haven't

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.780 
difficult to move that's why I haven't
taken<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.410> out<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:47.890> since<00:03:48.130> they<00:03:48.370> are<00:03:48.580> starting

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
taken it out but since they are starting

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.850 
taken it out but since they are starting
to<00:03:48.940> like<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.390> level<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:50.170> going<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.650> keep<00:03:50.740> it

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
to like this level I'm going to keep it

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:59.250 
to like this level I'm going to keep it
up<00:03:50.980> here<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:54.600> at<00:03:55.600> first<00:03:56.550> whenever<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:58.060> had<00:03:59.020> set

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
up here but at first whenever I had set

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.460 
up here but at first whenever I had set
this<00:03:59.410> up<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.830> had<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:01.800> had<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:03.040> potty<00:04:03.340> here<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:04.470> um

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
this up I had I had a potty here and um

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.920 
this up I had I had a potty here and um
and<00:04:05.860> I<00:04:06.010> thought<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.520> was<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:07.390> level<00:04:07.750> was<00:04:07.900> too

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
and I thought it was this level was too

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.000 
and I thought it was this level was too
high<00:04:08.110> for<00:04:08.590> them<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:10.030> go<00:04:10.180> up<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:11.200> reach<00:04:11.380> up<00:04:11.620> but

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
high for them to go up to reach up but

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.600 
high for them to go up to reach up but
they<00:04:12.400> can<00:04:12.550> reach<00:04:12.700> up<00:04:12.880> fine<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:14.610> they

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
they can reach up fine actually they

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.310 
they can reach up fine actually they
start<00:04:15.880> using<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.299> potty<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.720> get<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.960> and<00:04:17.200> to

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
start using the potty to get up and to

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.080 
start using the potty to get up and to
get<00:04:17.470> out<00:04:17.590> but<00:04:17.979> after<00:04:18.100> they<00:04:18.370> got<00:04:18.489> used<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:18.910> just

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
get out but after they got used to just

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.090 
get out but after they got used to just
standing<00:04:19.450> up<00:04:19.540> they<00:04:20.020> can<00:04:20.169> just<00:04:20.200> climb<00:04:20.560> up

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
standing up they can just climb up

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.450 
I have to be careful when close you this

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
because sometimes I'll forget that

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.850 
because sometimes I'll forget that
there's<00:05:04.849> no<00:05:04.999> stopper<00:05:05.449> in<00:05:05.629> a<00:05:05.719> little<00:05:05.930> slam<00:05:06.169> but

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
there's no stopper in a little slam but

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.439 
there's no stopper in a little slam but

i like how i can see through everything

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.519 
i like how i can see through everything
and<00:05:08.749> I<00:05:08.840> can<00:05:08.990> see<00:05:09.169> what's<00:05:09.319> going<00:05:09.409> on<00:05:09.680> but<00:05:10.639> um<00:05:11.529> if
