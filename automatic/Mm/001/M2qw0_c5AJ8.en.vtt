00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.310
 this is the match 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.760
 and this what we are going to observe the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.410
 fair result if we analyze it so 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.070
 that we see in the score ended up being 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.929
 a 1 has been just what was in the game 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.929
 I just want to say from 1 to 0 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.829
 efe 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.170
 I do not have it 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.050
 I dont know 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
 defense and justice plays well plays well 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.719
 independent is very effective what 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.339
 that does not want to be that has good game 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.680
 good but he plays what the goal comes 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.170
 not that it comes but that does not want and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.149
 benitez like this came in handy it 's fine by 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 that happens to me in space changes a 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.600
 space change perfect forgiveness and makes 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.640
 that the archer who has cost 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 completely out of action I want 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.350
 share with you a concept that is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.640
 It seems to me that in Argentine football 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.190
 we are playing with scores and not with 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.619
 musicians that I want to say the I just 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.440
 says the face injustice plays well 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.570
 take good care of something but maybe your 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.280
 players can be others and I would play 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 the same form but of following 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.300
 eight risk situations when I say 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 it's fine I think it has many 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.190
 situations of goal who risks sum 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.280
 of its more risks it attacks by the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.650
 sides uses the sides 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.820
 try to play with the ball on the floor 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.360
 foot 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 norris to the ball but the game 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.270
 franchise of justice for me for me 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.350
 precisely order from where it came from the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.930
 football recovery press and 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.930
 had in these last precise dates 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:23.470
 goes out to cut the attack of the appetite 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:26.860
 and america player was having 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.960
 It was penal victor costs to Rodriguez 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.960
 for me not for me not 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:42.750
 to round out what he was saying was to listen 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.750
 to the protagonists and we return to the floor 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.010
 but beyond the victory that rescues 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.010
 of positive 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.940
 defense you have to congratulate you put the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.010
 ball to the ground people are excited 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.490
 from mauricio good you have to go little by little 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.620
 to mediate you have to go little by little I think 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.300
 that we play better all the game and that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.190
 an unfortunate move injected the goal 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.440
 it's practically the only opportunity 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.790
 goal that they had why I'm going with that 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.890
 shame but in the pride of the players 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.690
 which gave the latter as the dresses 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.730
 the view of here of criminal sight and of the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.250
 bank I can not see it but you 're going to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.080
 breaking the box for eleven is criminal and it's 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.030
 a controversy but in the triad nothing the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.510
 better when they did the same so 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.569
 the first one also now remains that way 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.760
 with anger as they do so that people 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.620
 do not lose that illusion because it is very 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.239
 excited for a long time not 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.950
 shouted today you have to win to be 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.319
 champion a long time ago you did not hear this 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.579
 here the people of what I say is 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.650
 excited by what the 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.690
 team beyond the results and that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.799
 is the important thing is the illusion we 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.959
 we're going to cut anyone off 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.579
 otherwise we are going to add everything in a 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.470
 moment there is a goal I thought that 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.560
 level 3 independent easy not me 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.409
 I always had the expectation here always 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.879
 distrusted me and what I always say to 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.220
 me independent they had to throw me out 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.230
 the kicks and so because it's a club 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.720
 great that won many drinks and I value 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.950
 to this club that gave me a lot of the only 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.780
 way that I want to continue here is 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.160
 leaving champion with independent one 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.109
 he wonders why independent because 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.190
 you were in europe at an optimal time 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.080
 keep playing the selection of Uruguay 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.860
 for you independent and at this moment 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.560
 I think Argentina has very good 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.539
 conditions is a very cute championship 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 play it and well I always liked play 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.050
 the shirt of this soraya match 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.430
 RodrÃ­guez goes to all the fans 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.090
 independent was allowed 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.090
 yellow
