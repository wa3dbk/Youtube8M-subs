mark right you want to get a computer
cheaper<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.380> Dan's<00:04:29.650> in<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.460> tire<00:04:30.700> computer

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
cheaper that Dan's in the tire computer

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.480 
cheaper that Dan's in the tire computer
cheaper<00:04:31.360> than<00:04:31.450> dance<00:04:31.690> video<00:04:32.320> card<00:04:32.680> alone<00:04:33.100> so

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
cheaper than dance video card alone so

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.560 
cheaper than dance video card alone so
we're<00:04:33.639> going<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.820> build<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.270> it's<00:04:34.360> going<00:04:34.510> to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
we're going to build it it's going to

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.420 
we're going to build it it's going to
become<00:04:34.690> one<00:04:34.990> of<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.169> set<00:04:35.380> pieces<00:04:35.650> here<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
become one of the set pieces here on the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.040 
become one of the set pieces here on the
screen<00:04:36.610> savers<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.210> we're<00:04:37.690> going<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.870> compare

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
screen savers and we're going to compare

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.170 
screen savers and we're going to compare
it<00:04:38.320> weird<00:04:38.830> then<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.639> ultimate<00:04:39.970> gaming

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
it weird then to the ultimate gaming

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.430 
it weird then to the ultimate gaming
machine<00:04:40.330> when<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.750> comes<00:04:40.930> out<00:04:41.110> next<00:04:41.320> month

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
machine when that comes out next month

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.020 
machine when that comes out next month
oh<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.160> we'll<00:04:42.280> have<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.460> benchmarks<00:04:42.880> on<00:04:42.970> the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
oh so we'll have the benchmarks on the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.670 
oh so we'll have the benchmarks on the
two<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.570> know<00:04:43.690> I'll<00:04:43.900> tell<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.200> what<00:04:44.320> the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
two you know I'll tell you what the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.470 
two you know I'll tell you what the
ultimate<00:04:44.770> gaming<00:04:45.130> machine<00:04:45.220> will<00:04:45.820> be<00:04:46.000> faster

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
ultimate gaming machine will be faster

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.610 
ultimate gaming machine will be faster
but<00:04:46.510> it's<00:04:46.690> going<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.840> cost<00:04:46.900> like<00:04:47.169> three<00:04:47.440> times

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
but it's going to cost like three times

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.340 
but it's going to cost like three times
is<00:04:47.770> about<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.130> list<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:49.030> parts<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.870> links

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
is about to the list the parts the links

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
everybody through building a system

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.850 
everybody through building a system
because<00:04:59.110> we<00:04:59.200> haven't<00:04:59.440> done<00:04:59.530> that<00:04:59.590> well
