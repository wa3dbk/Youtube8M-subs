00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
one and I found myself asking at the end

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.519 
one and I found myself asking at the end
of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> game<00:00:23.750> what<00:00:24.750> what<00:00:25.140> could<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.470> done

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
of the game what what could I have done

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.950 
of the game what what could I have done
differently<00:00:26.369> why<00:00:26.730> did<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.060> lose<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.630> game

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
differently why did I lose that game

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.779 
differently why did I lose that game
because<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> was<00:00:28.980> frustrated<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> goals

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
because I was frustrated with the goals

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.540 
because I was frustrated with the goals
that<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.000> gave<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:31.529> went<00:00:31.980> back<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.219> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that I gave up and I went back and I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.600 
that I gave up and I went back and I
watched<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> replay<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> game<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.610> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
watched the replay of the game and I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
watched the replay of the game and I
started<00:00:36.329> laughing<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.410> goals<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
started laughing because the goals that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.410 
started laughing because the goals that
i<00:00:37.890> gave<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.340> could<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.730> easily<00:00:39.030> been

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
i gave up could have easily been

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.770 
i gave up could have easily been
prevented<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.559> were<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.920> terrible<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.629> was

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
prevented they were just terrible it was

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.170 
prevented they were just terrible it was
a<00:00:42.809> combination<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.440> mechanics<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> poor

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
a combination of mechanics and poor

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
a combination of mechanics and poor
decision<00:00:45.570> making<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.020> my<00:00:46.230> part<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
decision making on my part now when I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.830 
decision making on my part now when I
say<00:00:47.579> mechanics<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.420> refer<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:50.449> your<00:00:51.449> when

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
say mechanics I refer to your when

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.090 
say mechanics I refer to your when
you're<00:00:51.960> holding<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> controller<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> your

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you're holding the controller in your

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.770 
you're holding the controller in your
hand<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.460> actual<00:00:53.820> mechanics<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.390> how<00:00:54.539> well

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
hand your actual mechanics or how well

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
hand your actual mechanics or how well
your<00:00:55.050> Mabel<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> manipulate<00:00:56.340> your<00:00:56.520> team<00:00:56.850> or

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
your Mabel to manipulate your team or

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
your Mabel to manipulate your team or
your<00:00:57.270> players<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> screen<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
your players on the screen with the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.139 
your players on the screen with the
controller<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:00:59.730> referring<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
controller that's what I'm referring to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
controller that's what I'm referring to
as<00:01:00.480> mechanics<00:01:01.340> now<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:04.080> other<00:01:04.260> problem<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
as mechanics now the other problem is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490 
as mechanics now the other problem is
decision<00:01:05.850> making<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.630> my<00:01:06.780> fault<00:01:07.200> um

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
decision making and how is my fault um

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.380 
decision making and how is my fault um
and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.070> could<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.280> back<00:01:08.490> throw<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.850> through<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and I could go back throw it through and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
and I could go back throw it through and
show<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.600> guys<00:01:09.630> those<00:01:09.960> goals<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.760> learned

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
show you guys those goals but I learned

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.130 
show you guys those goals but I learned
something<00:01:12.090> from<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.600> thought<00:01:12.750> well<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
something from it I thought well you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
something from it I thought well you
know<00:01:13.170> next<00:01:13.380> time<00:01:13.560> I'm<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.920> situation<00:01:14.220> I'm

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
know next time I'm in that situation I'm

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
know next time I'm in that situation I'm
most<00:01:14.820> definitely<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
most definitely not going to do that and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
most definitely not going to do that and
chances<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.130> i'm<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.600> score

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
chances are i'm not going to get score

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
chances are i'm not going to get score
on<00:01:18.930> again<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> way<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:19.970> now<00:01:20.970> there's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
on again that way well now there's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
on again that way well now there's
natural<00:01:21.299> reactions<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.049> sometimes<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
natural reactions that sometimes you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.990 
natural reactions that sometimes you
just<00:01:22.740> can't<00:01:22.830> prevent<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.790> there's<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
just can't prevent but so there's a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.310 
just can't prevent but so there's a
chance<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.390> i'll<00:01:24.570> get<00:01:24.659> scored<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> same

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
chance that i'll get scored on the same

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.950 
chance that i'll get scored on the same
way<00:01:25.439> again<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.460> should<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.479> better<00:01:27.689> next

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
way again but I should know better next

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.679 
way again but I should know better next
time<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.439> footy<00:01:28.710> brain<00:01:29.009> should<00:01:29.250> tell<00:01:29.520> me

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
time my footy brain should tell me

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.819 
time my footy brain should tell me
better<00:01:30.689> next<00:01:31.020> time<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.869> thought<00:01:33.869> hey<00:01:34.259> my

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
better next time so I thought hey my

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.080 
better next time so I thought hey my
gameplay<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.250> probably<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> improve<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
gameplay is probably going to improve a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.789 
gameplay is probably going to improve a
little<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.439> many<00:01:37.740> you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
little bit from this and as many you
guys<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.400> consider<00:01:38.880> myself<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.509> kind

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
message make it tasty make it sound

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.320

interesting<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.820> will<00:03:47.970> look<00:03:48.090> through<00:03:48.120> as

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
interesting but I will look through as

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.060 
interesting but I will look through as
many<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.410> going<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.620> go<00:03:49.770> back

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
many as I can and I'm going to go back

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.979 
many as I can and I'm going to go back
through<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.760> highlight<00:03:51.390> things<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.959> I

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
through and highlight things that I

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.960 
through and highlight things that I
think<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:53.220> maybe<00:03:53.430> could<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.760> done

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
think you maybe could have done

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.060 
think you maybe could have done
differently<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.630> help<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.290> win<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.650> game<00:03:55.830> or

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
differently to help you win that game or

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.310 
differently to help you win that game or
if<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:57.150> looks<00:03:57.360> like<00:03:57.450> it's<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.750> consistent

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
if it looks like it's a consistent

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.130 
if it looks like it's a consistent
problem<00:03:58.560> over<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.370> over<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.670> over<00:03:59.820> again

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
problem over and over and over again

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.000 
problem over and over and over again
then<00:04:01.140> it's<00:04:01.290> one<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.500> those<00:04:01.560> things<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.830> I'm

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
then it's one of those things that I'm

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.400 
then it's one of those things that I'm
gonna<00:04:02.130> say<00:04:02.310> hey<00:04:02.489> yay<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.840> guys<00:04:04.020> know<00:04:04.260> this

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
gonna say hey yay you guys know this

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.290 
gonna say hey yay you guys know this
problems<00:04:04.800> here<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.250> actually<00:04:05.730> have<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
problems here I actually have the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.120 
problems here I actually have the
evidence<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:06.989> video<00:04:07.260> proof<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.800> back<00:04:07.830> it

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
evidence in the video proof to back it

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.820 
evidence in the video proof to back it
up<00:04:08.370> now<00:04:08.610> in<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.350> catalog<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.770> guess<00:04:11.520> series<00:04:11.970> uh

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
maybe we can look at changing that so

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.570 
maybe we can look at changing that so
how<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.830> something<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.280> guys<00:04:17.430> will

had<00:04:50.290> no<00:04:50.560> idea<00:04:50.790> what<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.880> penalty<00:04:52.210> was<00:04:52.330> given

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
had no idea what the penalty was given

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.360 
had no idea what the penalty was given
for<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:53.170> was<00:04:53.380> given<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:53.800> an<00:04:53.890> off-the-ball

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370

thing<00:04:54.640> that<00:04:54.790> I<00:04:54.820> would<00:04:54.940> never<00:04:55.390> have<00:04:55.690> noticed

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
thing that I would never have noticed

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.480
