and then the primary ones that we work
in<00:01:25.149> our<00:01:25.240> core<00:01:25.600> are<00:01:25.840> what's<00:01:26.440> called<00:01:26.530> your

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
in our core are what's called your

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.070 
in our core are what's called your
transversus<00:01:27.280> abdominus<00:01:28.060> there<00:01:28.300> as<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.690> muscle

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
transversus abdominus there as a muscle

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.960 
transversus abdominus there as a muscle
that<00:01:29.110> wraps<00:01:29.410> around<00:01:29.649> you<00:01:30.039> like<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.250> dump<00:01:30.670> it's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
that wraps around you like a dump it's

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.580 
that wraps around you like a dump it's
actually<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.479> only<00:01:31.569> abdominal<00:01:32.229> muscle<00:01:32.530> that

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
actually the only abdominal muscle that

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.499 
actually the only abdominal muscle that
you<00:01:32.740> have<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.190> physiologically<00:01:34.000> attaches

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
you have that physiologically attaches

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.660 
you have that physiologically attaches
to<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:35.380> spine<00:01:35.649> itself<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.429> it<00:01:36.459> actually

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
to the spine itself so it actually

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.730 
to the spine itself so it actually
starts<00:01:37.149> in<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.360> back<00:01:37.539> wraps<00:01:38.080> around<00:01:38.319> you<00:01:38.619> like

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.260 
engage that muscle and also a
little-known<00:01:47.799> secret<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.400> that<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.850> muscle

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
little-known secret is that that muscle

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.640 
little-known secret is that that muscle
is<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.450> very<00:01:49.690> first<00:01:49.869> muscle<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.470> your

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
is the very first muscle that your

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.680 
is the very first muscle that your
nervous<00:01:50.979> system<00:01:51.009> of<00:01:51.430> your<00:01:51.549> brain<00:01:51.820> engages<00:01:52.390> in

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
nervous system of your brain engages in

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.800 
nervous system of your brain engages in
fires<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.740> stabilize<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.430> with<00:01:55.210> any<00:01:55.360> movement

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
fires to stabilize you with any movement

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.030 
fires to stabilize you with any movement
so<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.020> can<00:01:56.229> just<00:01:56.259> wiggle<00:01:56.650> your<00:01:56.770> little

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
so you can just wiggle your little

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.680 
so you can just wiggle your little
finger<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.700> your<00:01:58.060> body<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.330> going<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.509> go<00:01:58.630> to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
finger and your body is going to go to

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.320 
finger and your body is going to go to
establish<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.530> hold<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.890> muscle<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:01.119> if<00:02:01.210> you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
establish and hold that muscle so if you

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.480 
establish and hold that muscle so if you
find<00:02:01.540> that<00:02:01.659> muscle<00:02:02.050> ahead<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.380> time<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:03.340> rest

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
find that muscle ahead of time the rest

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.530 
find that muscle ahead of time the rest
are<00:02:03.580> going<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.759> get<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> lot<00:02:03.940> more<00:02:04.090> core

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
are going to get a lot more core

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.030 
are going to get a lot more core
strength<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.930> stability<00:02:05.020> not<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.710> lot<00:02:05.920> more

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
cannonball position when we squeeze on

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.430 
cannonball position when we squeeze on
knees<00:02:36.910> together<00:02:37.150> let<00:02:37.840> me<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.989> just<00:02:38.170> repeat

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
that guy for about 10 to 15 repetitions

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.540 
that guy for about 10 to 15 repetitions
and<00:02:40.780> do<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> few<00:02:41.170> sets<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:41.980> I'm<00:02:42.370> going

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
and do a few sets of that so I'm going

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.800 
and do a few sets of that so I'm going
to<00:02:42.580> demonstrate<00:02:42.730> here<00:02:43.180> on<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.450> floor<00:02:43.600> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
to demonstrate here on the floor and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.630 
to demonstrate here on the floor and
just<00:02:43.930> incorporate<00:02:44.830> that<00:02:44.980> into<00:02:45.220> your<00:02:45.459> regular

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
abdominal program and you'll really

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.140 
abdominal program and you'll really
notice<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.320> big<00:02:47.560> difference<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.519> how<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:48.940> do

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
notice a big difference and how you do

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.460 
notice a big difference and how you do
your<00:02:49.180> core<00:02:49.540> because<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:49.840> not<00:02:49.930> about<00:02:50.170> my

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
your core because it's not about my

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.500 
your core because it's not about my
repetitions<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.519> its<00:02:51.820> how<00:02:52.060> well<00:02:52.329> you're

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
repetitions it to do its how well you're

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
repetitions it to do its how well you're
doing<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.079> it's<00:02:53.320> quality<00:02:53.650> over<00:02:54.280> quantity<00:02:54.310> you

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
doing so it's quality over quantity you

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.460 
doing so it's quality over quantity you
do<00:02:55.150> core<00:02:55.390> muscles<00:02:55.810> right<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.200> they<00:02:56.260> really

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
do core muscles right and they really

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.440 
do core muscles right and they really
hope<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.829> burn<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.370> look<00:02:57.910> at<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.120> so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
hope that burn and look at this so

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.090 
hope that burn and look at this so

in my FMS functional loop and screening

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.160 
in my FMS functional loop and screening
around<00:03:27.909> here<00:03:28.180> i<00:03:28.209> made<00:03:28.480> another<00:03:28.599> video<00:03:28.870> on<00:03:29.049> that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
around here i made another video on that

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.289 
around here i made another video on that
that's<00:03:29.500> how<00:03:29.650> well<00:03:29.890> we<00:03:30.040> look<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.180> how

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
that's how well we look and see how

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.240 
that's how well we look and see how
athletes<00:03:31.900> move<00:03:32.230> where<00:03:32.470> they<00:03:32.560> move<00:03:32.769> correctly

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
athletes move where they move correctly

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.160 
athletes move where they move correctly
with<00:03:33.519> what<00:03:33.879> called<00:03:34.060> functional<00:03:34.510> movement<00:03:34.959> and

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
with what called functional movement and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.690 
with what called functional movement and
that<00:03:35.409> makes<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.709> different<00:03:36.040> time<00:03:36.220> your

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
that makes a different time your

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.759 
that makes a different time your
athletic<00:03:37.090> ability<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.959> you're<00:03:38.170> also<00:03:38.349> like
