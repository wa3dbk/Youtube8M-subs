2004-2005<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:59.129> game<00:00:59.309> changed<00:00:59.760> or

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
2004-2005 as your game changed or

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.670 
2004-2005 as your game changed or
evolved<00:01:00.359> since<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.079> time<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> bucks<00:01:01.590> fans

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
