00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.800
 good afternoon dear colleagues my name is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.170
 Sergey Zakharov I represent the company 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.099
 photo mechanic 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 Today I want to tell you about 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.680
 3D photography technology 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.520
 which are used 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 numerous online stores 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.989
 museums photographers to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 present the item on the computer screen 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.460
 from different sides and give the user 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.600
 opportunity to learn more about it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.600
 consider twist and familiarize yourself with 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.050
 by him 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.309
 to create such images of such 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.339
 three-dimensional photos 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.390
 used special equipment 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.969
 we produce this equipment she 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.769
 used in conjunction with traditional 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.480
 traditional photographic equipment from 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.659
 studio lighting with a camera 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:17.040
 tripod and computer here on the table 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.310
 I have a turntable and d60 which 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.259
 allows you to take 3d photos of objects 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 medium-sized principle of its operation 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.930
 very simple we connect this table to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 computer we connect the camera 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.009
 which stands next to a tripod 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.020
 computer and run a special 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.430
 the program that controls the shooting 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.420
 controls the camera to control 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.920
 turntable twists it on 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.979
 a certain angle after which 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.070
 clicking the shutter turns it on 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.329
 click the shutter and so on until 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.619
 make the number of shots that we 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.960
 asked during the shooting all the photos 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.270
 pumped to the computer and after 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.640
 the end of the shooting they are all all in 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 computer memory there they are stitched in 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.780
 video of the selected format that can 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.190
 upload to website add to catalog 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.869
 or just save to hard drive 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.790
 let's see how it works 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.660
 equipment as we can with it 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.330
 create a three-dimensional photo in my 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.550
 computer running a photo program 3d 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.230
 studio that manages the shoot 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.820
 controls the cameras controls 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.280
 turntable now i will show and 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.200
 then you see the program interface 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.780
 rotation device ie swivel 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.180
 the table and the camera decided on the program I 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.370
 I see it just in case I will do a trial 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.260
 snapshot 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.150
 I see the result on the screen, checking that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.050
 my subject 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.800
 hit the frame that is bright enough 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.660
 illuminated 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:03:00.480
 and I can scroll it just in case 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:05.260
 just choose the number of frames let's 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.610
 stop at 3 36 frames and run 3d 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.450
 photography for this click 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.680
 perfect button that's started 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.680
 shooting process 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.110
 all photos from the camera immediately 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.600
 loaded in computers I see everything on 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.510
 I also see the screen 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.970
 the course of the shooting program writes 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.940
 what frame is it taking and how much 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.760
 all of them left 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.370
 I can switch to manual mode in manual mode. 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.480
 mode to make a frame I have to 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.000
 press spacebar 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.440
 press space press space once more 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.960
 one more frame is done can go 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.650
 back automatic mode manual 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.630
 The mode is convenient if I want to do 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.530
 additional animation for example open 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.140
 laptop cover 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.140
 during rotation if I rent a laptop 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.520
 the number of frames can be put perfectly 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.620
 any from 1 to 360 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.360
 depends on how smooth it will be 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.750
 rotate the subject in the final videos 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.060
 it also depends on the volume of all 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.360
 video as it will take place and 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.380
 how long will it take to 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.380
 his downloads from the Internet 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.920
 all 36 frames made process took 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.290
 about a minute a little more than a minute 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.120
 I can already turn 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.220
 my item on my screen 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.560
 while it's in the program I see that everything 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.409
 it turned out great 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:53.319
 I choose the right format I can choose 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:56.569
 formats gif flash html 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:05:02.209
 choosing the resolution in which I save 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:03.439
 my video and write it down now 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:05.869
 the program recodes 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.199
 images from the camera 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:16.969
 the desired size and generate will generate 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:24.009
 video all video generated open 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:24.009
 it is in the folder where it is preserved 

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:31.429
 opening a picture of the edge in the browser 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:34.659
 image browser so I can twist and 

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:37.009
 You may also have to turn anyone 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.849
 which is the internet browser that is 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.849
 any computer user 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.830
 video can be uploaded to the site also 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.190
 will look absolutely will also 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.180
 look on site 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.830
 I can twist it with the mouse 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.830
 I can spin 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.069
 by and large this is all that is 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:07.279
 in just two minutes we collected such 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:10.189
 video there are many additional 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:12.309
 functions in the program for convenience for 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:15.409
 empowerment 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:18.939
 photographer on them now not to tell 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.939
 we will thank
