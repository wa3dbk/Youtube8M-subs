together the hairball combines combines
an<00:01:34.590> overdrive<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.520> booster<00:01:36.140> obviously

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
an overdrive and a booster obviously

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
together and the overdrive sounds really

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
together and the overdrive sounds really
great<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.610> heard<00:01:41.759> let's<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.569> a<00:01:42.600> look<00:01:42.869> at

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
great as we heard let's take a look at

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
great as we heard let's take a look at
each<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:43.289> effects<00:01:44.280> individually

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
each of these effects individually

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
each of these effects individually
they're<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.090> switchable<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:46.380> selectable

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
they're all switchable or selectable

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.850 
they're all switchable or selectable
individually<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.420> they're<00:01:48.630> obviously<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
individually and they're obviously you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.899 
individually and they're obviously you
can<00:01:49.979> use<00:01:50.159> them<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.340> conjunction<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.820> one

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
can use them in conjunction with one

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.429 
can use them in conjunction with one
another<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.869> interesting<00:01:52.049> thing<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.350> note

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
another one interesting thing to note

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
another one interesting thing to note
about<00:01:52.590> these<00:01:52.920> pedals<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> none<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
about these pedals is that none of the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.770 
about these pedals is that none of the
dvk<00:01:54.659> pedals<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.979> take<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> 9-volt<00:01:56.970> battery<00:01:57.390> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
dvk pedals can take a 9-volt battery you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
dvk pedals can take a 9-volt battery you
can<00:01:57.810> only<00:01:58.020> power<00:01:58.259> them<00:01:58.500> off<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.710> 9<00:01:59.040> volt<00:01:59.070> power

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
can only power them off a 9 volt power

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060 
can only power them off a 9 volt power
adapter<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.770> company

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
adapter and that's because the company

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
adapter and that's because the company
wants<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> sort<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> dissuade<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.479> sort<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
wants to sort of dissuade the sort of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.410 
wants to sort of dissuade the sort of
waste<00:02:04.229> inherent<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.399> battery<00:02:05.850> use<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
waste inherent in in battery use so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.120 
waste inherent in in battery use so
that's<00:02:06.750> kind<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.930> nice<00:02:07.049> anyway<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.070> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
that's kind of nice anyway back to the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.819 
that's kind of nice anyway back to the
pedal<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:09.090> overdrive<00:02:09.750> sounds<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.649> good

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829

tambor right here is actually sort of

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.670 
tambor right here is actually sort of
your<00:02:22.210> gain<00:02:22.450> control<00:02:22.960> so<00:02:23.080> let's<00:02:23.230> turn<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.530> guy

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
your gain control so let's turn this guy

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:40.520 
your gain control so let's turn this guy
down

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.100 

you

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.480 

even<00:02:44.110> right<00:02:44.200> there<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.500> get<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.620> nice<00:02:44.800> range<00:02:45.250> of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
even right there you get a nice range of

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:56.390 
even right there you get a nice range of
tones<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.570> get<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.750> tone<00:02:47.080> control<00:02:47.440> here<00:02:47.620> to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.370 

just<00:02:57.400> basically<00:02:57.580> dials<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.480> or<00:02:58.690> dials<00:02:59.110> back

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
just basically dials in or dials back

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.130 
just basically dials in or dials back
treble<00:03:00.360> then<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.450> get<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.570> level<00:03:01.750> control

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
treble then you get a level control

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.410 
treble then you get a level control
let's<00:03:03.010> switch<00:03:03.190> off<00:03:03.370> overdrive<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.090> go<00:03:04.240> to<00:03:04.300> our

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
let's switch off overdrive and go to our

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.860 
let's switch off overdrive and go to our
booster<00:03:05.080> side<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.470> things<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:10.570> booster

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
booster side of things and your booster

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.450 
booster side of things and your booster
has<00:03:11.020> two<00:03:11.320> simple<00:03:11.770> functions<00:03:12.130> we've<00:03:12.280> got<00:03:12.430> a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
has two simple functions we've got a

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.010 
has two simple functions we've got a
level<00:03:12.820> control<00:03:13.210> here<00:03:13.420> which<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.780> pretty

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
level control here which is pretty

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.860 
level control here which is pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:19.000> then<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.720> this

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
self-explanatory and then you get this

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.330 
self-explanatory and then you get this
switch<00:03:20.200> as<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> little<00:03:20.740> dip<00:03:20.860> switch<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.190> says

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
switch as a little dip switch it says

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.190 
switch as a little dip switch it says
treble<00:03:21.910> boost<00:03:22.090> or<00:03:22.270> full<00:03:22.480> range<00:03:22.720> we've<00:03:22.900> been<00:03:23.050> in

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
treble boost or full range we've been in

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:35.910 
treble boost or full range we've been in
treble<00:03:23.440> boost<00:03:23.740> this<00:03:23.890> whole<00:03:24.070> time<00:03:34.590> now<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.680> can

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
treble boost this whole time now you can

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.490 
treble boost this whole time now you can
use<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.400> booster<00:03:36.850> by<00:03:37.120> itself<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.750> drive<00:03:38.140> a

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
use this booster by itself to drive a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.850 
use this booster by itself to drive a
tube<00:03:39.160> amp<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.690> AC<00:03:40.840> 15<00:03:41.320> that<00:03:41.500> we've<00:03:41.620> got

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
tube amp like the AC 15 that we've got

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.850 
tube amp like the AC 15 that we've got
to<00:03:42.100> run<00:03:42.850> right<00:03:43.120> now<00:03:43.320> but<00:03:44.320> it<00:03:44.410> works<00:03:44.590> sort<00:03:44.800> of

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
to run right now but it works sort of

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.230 
to run right now but it works sort of
brilliantly<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.430> conjunction<00:03:45.880> with<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
brilliantly in conjunction with the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.810 
brilliantly in conjunction with the
overdrive<00:03:46.690> effect<00:03:47.080> as<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.190> sort<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.430> heard<00:03:48.670> of

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
overdrive effect as you sort of heard of

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.620 
overdrive effect as you sort of heard of
the<00:03:48.910> intro<00:03:50.220> with<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.700> setup<00:03:52.150> right<00:03:52.390> now<00:03:52.570> we

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
the intro with this setup right now we

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.030 
the intro with this setup right now we
get<00:03:52.870> sort<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.110> nice<00:03:53.230> clean<00:03:53.590> tone<00:03:55.860> from<00:03:56.860> our

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
get sort of a nice clean tone from our

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.360 
get sort of a nice clean tone from our
amp<00:03:57.280> we<00:03:57.760> can<00:03:57.910> bring<00:03:58.150> in<00:03:58.269> some<00:03:58.450> overdrive

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.410 

then<00:04:04.370> we<00:04:04.430> get<00:04:04.579> some<00:04:04.700> lead<00:04:04.879> tones<00:04:05.120> with<00:04:05.299> this

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
then we get some lead tones with this

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:15.950 
then we get some lead tones with this
booster<00:04:05.750> engaged

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:52.450 

Oh

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.400 

so<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.550> can<00:04:53.670> see<00:04:53.820> how<00:04:53.850> each<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.180> these<00:04:54.450> effects

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
so you can see how each of these effects

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.490 
so you can see how each of these effects
working<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:56.040> conjunction<00:04:56.490> sort<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.500> multiply

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
working in conjunction sort of multiply

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.530 
working in conjunction sort of multiply
the<00:04:58.560> tones<00:04:59.160> and<00:04:59.490> possibility<00:05:00.210> is<00:05:00.300> sort<00:05:00.510> of

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
the tones and possibility is sort of

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.890 
the tones and possibility is sort of
exponentially<00:05:02.390> exponentially<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:03.690> there's

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
exponentially exponentially and there's

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.390 
exponentially exponentially and there's
two<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.080> them<00:05:04.200> anyway<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.160> there<00:05:05.280> you<00:05:05.310> go

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
two of them anyway so there you go

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.920 
two of them anyway so there you go
