00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
on my hydrogen project

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.230 
on my hydrogen project
and<00:00:14.750> what<00:00:15.320> I've<00:00:15.470> done<00:00:15.680> is<00:00:16.010> installed<00:00:16.700> two

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240

it'd be bad for the engine if that
happened<00:00:52.460> what<00:00:53.420> i'm<00:00:53.540> doing<00:00:53.810> here<00:00:53.930> is<00:00:53.990> filling

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
now the first road test is going to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.890 
now the first road test is going to
start<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.430> mason<00:01:13.030> michigan

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
start in mason michigan

start in mason michigan
and<00:01:15.200> I'm<00:01:15.500> going<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.680> drive<00:01:16.750> back<00:01:17.750> home<00:01:17.810> a

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
and I'm going to drive back home a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.550 
and I'm going to drive back home a
distance<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:20.020> forty<00:01:21.020> 1.7<00:01:21.860> miles<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:23.410> topped<00:01:24.410> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
distance of forty 1.7 miles I topped the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.040 
distance of forty 1.7 miles I topped the
gas<00:01:24.770> off<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.310> mason<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.090> I'm<00:01:26.630> going<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.840> fill

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
gas off in mason and I'm going to fill

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.130 
gas off in mason and I'm going to fill
it<00:01:27.080> back<00:01:27.290> up<00:01:27.350> in<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.250> Polian<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.750> I'm<00:01:29.990> going

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
it back up in the Polian and I'm going

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.020 
it back up in the Polian and I'm going
to<00:01:30.170> find<00:01:30.380> out<00:01:30.530> exactly<00:01:31.220> how<00:01:31.400> much<00:01:31.460> gas<00:01:31.820> i

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
to find out exactly how much gas i

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.530 
to find out exactly how much gas i
burned

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.300 

how<00:01:35.140> many<00:01:35.290> miles<00:01:35.500> per<00:01:35.680> gallon<00:01:36.130> I'm<00:01:37.000> getting

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
how many miles per gallon I'm getting

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.900 
how many miles per gallon I'm getting
now<00:01:39.310> normally<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.940> car<00:01:40.360> gets<00:01:40.660> up<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:41.460> 38<00:01:42.460> miles

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
now normally the car gets up to 38 miles

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.850 
now normally the car gets up to 38 miles
per<00:01:43.420> gallon<00:01:43.630> highway

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.870 

so<00:01:47.490> i<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.790> my<00:01:47.820> generators<00:01:48.750> filled<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.760> put<00:01:50.760> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
so i got my generators filled up put the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.370 
so i got my generators filled up put the
filler<00:01:51.090> plugs<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:53.510> then<00:01:54.510> i<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> car

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
filler plugs in then i got in the car

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
filler plugs in then i got in the car
and<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.880> powered<00:01:57.330> up<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.720> generators<00:01:58.880> started

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and I powered up the generators started

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.719 
and I powered up the generators started
the<00:02:00.000> engine<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:01.620> it<00:02:02.040> ran<00:02:02.160> pretty<00:02:02.430> good<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:04.729> we

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the engine and it ran pretty good so we

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.570 
the engine and it ran pretty good so we
went<00:02:05.940> out<00:02:06.150> on<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.390> highway<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.460> topped<00:02:08.460> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
went out on the highway and topped it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.340 
went out on the highway and topped it
off<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.790> gas<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:10.490> headed<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.520> home

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.220 

not<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.460> highway<00:02:17.850> began<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.780> sputter<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
not on the highway began to sputter a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
not on the highway began to sputter a
little<00:02:19.530> bit<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.340> stopped<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.970> checked

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
little bit and when we stopped I checked

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.980 
little bit and when we stopped I checked
the<00:02:25.340> filter<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.550> found<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.090> indeed<00:02:27.570> some

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
the filter and found that indeed some

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.010 
the filter and found that indeed some
water<00:02:28.230> had<00:02:28.530> gotten<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.690> I'm<00:02:30.690> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:30.960> to

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
water had gotten so I'm going to have to

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.890 
water had gotten so I'm going to have to
build<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.320> water<00:02:31.530> trap<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.310> stop<00:02:32.580> that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.619 

but<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> encouraging<00:02:37.129> thing<00:02:37.189> is<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:38.090> when<00:02:38.599> I

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
but the encouraging thing is that when I

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.230 
but the encouraging thing is that when I
check<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.110> mileage

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
check the mileage

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.270 
check the mileage
I<00:02:41.300> was<00:02:41.960> getting<00:02:42.730> 48<00:02:43.730> miles

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
I was getting 48 miles

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.520 
I was getting 48 miles
and<00:02:46.209> what<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.540> saw<00:02:46.780> there's<00:02:47.080> well

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and what you just saw there's well

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.370 
and what you just saw there's well

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.449 
indicator light by my leg showing the
power<00:02:51.420> was<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.990> generators<00:02:53.560> we're

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
power was on to the generators we're

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.200 
power was on to the generators we're
traveling<00:02:55.060> at<00:02:55.209> 70<00:02:55.630> miles<00:02:55.810> per<00:02:56.020> hour

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.330 

and<00:03:01.450> aside<00:03:01.990> from<00:03:02.020> getting<00:03:02.410> them<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:03.070> little

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and aside from getting them that little

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.080 
and aside from getting them that little
bit<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.490> water<00:03:04.530> coming<00:03:05.530> through<00:03:05.910> engine<00:03:06.910> ran

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
bit of water coming through engine ran

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.610 
bit of water coming through engine ran
very<00:03:07.390> smoothly

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.039 

so<00:03:13.220> I'm<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.489> have<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.989> make<00:03:14.989> some

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
so I'm going to have to make some

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.410 
so I'm going to have to make some
modifications

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.860 

try<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.110> experiment<00:03:19.800> all<00:03:20.520> over<00:03:20.910> again<00:03:21.150> but

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
try this experiment all over again but

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.569 
try this experiment all over again but
48<00:03:22.380> miles<00:03:22.739> per<00:03:23.069> gallon<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.640> very<00:03:24.330> good
