00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
if you're looking into a processor

platform all I really had to do was

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.140

interfere<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.240> cooler<00:01:26.420> all<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.900> much

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
interfere with the cooler all that much

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.710 
interfere with the cooler all that much
and<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.619> was<00:01:27.770> relatively<00:01:28.310> easy<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.880> do<00:01:29.090> if<00:01:29.330> you

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
and it was relatively easy to do if you

were to do this on your own I would

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.099 
were to do this on your own I would
highly<00:01:31.009> recommend<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.640> proper<00:01:32.149> base<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.689> using

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
highly recommend a proper base and using

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.539 
highly recommend a proper base and using
the<00:01:33.289> mounting<00:01:33.619> hardware<00:01:33.740> from<00:01:34.219> maybe<00:01:34.460> a

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
like feet these feet stop the cooler

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.230

note is that the goal of this video is
to<00:03:19.910> compare<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.420> available<00:03:20.810> stock<00:03:21.110> cooling

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
to compare the available stock cooling

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.190 
to compare the available stock cooling
solutions<00:03:21.980> not<00:03:22.670> which<00:03:23.000> CPU<00:03:23.600> has<00:03:23.900> better

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
solutions not which CPU has better

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.620 
solutions not which CPU has better
thermal<00:03:24.560> output<00:03:24.860> that's<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:26.000> different<00:03:26.330> story

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
thermal output that's a different story

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.750 
thermal output that's a different story
for<00:03:26.900> another<00:03:27.049> time<00:03:27.319> in<00:03:27.920> conclusion<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
for another time in conclusion the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.039 
for another time in conclusion the
coolers<00:03:29.090> are<00:03:29.239> kind<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.540> made<00:03:29.720> for<00:03:29.930> what

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
coolers are kind of made for what

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.360 
coolers are kind of made for what
platform<00:03:30.500> they're<00:03:30.620> going<00:03:30.890> on<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:31.190> if<00:03:31.280> you

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
platform they're going on but if you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.009 
platform they're going on but if you
have<00:03:31.459> an<00:03:31.580> option<00:03:31.850> between<00:03:31.970> an<00:03:32.269> AMD<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.720> Intel

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
have an option between an AMD and Intel

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.650 
have an option between an AMD and Intel
CPU<00:03:33.410> cooler<00:03:33.739> regardless<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.580> your<00:03:34.730> CPU<00:03:35.209> you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
CPU cooler regardless of your CPU you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.539 
CPU cooler regardless of your CPU you
should<00:03:35.840> probably<00:03:36.110> grab<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.680> AMD<00:03:37.069> one<00:03:37.250> either

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
should probably grab the AMD one either

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.130 
should probably grab the AMD one either
solution<00:03:38.090> will<00:03:38.269> definitely<00:03:38.660> get<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.870> job

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
solution will definitely get the job

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.870 
solution will definitely get the job
done<00:03:39.350> if<00:03:39.530> you're<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.769> running<00:03:39.890> at<00:03:40.130> stock<00:03:40.370> but

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
done if you're just running at stock but

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.610 
done if you're just running at stock but
if<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.630> option<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.110> might<00:03:42.350> as<00:03:42.500> well

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
if you have the option you might as well

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.530 
if you have the option you might as well
take<00:03:42.860> it<00:03:43.069> this<00:03:43.459> does<00:03:43.730> draw<00:03:43.970> upon<00:03:44.269> another

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
take it this does draw upon another

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.300 
take it this does draw upon another
