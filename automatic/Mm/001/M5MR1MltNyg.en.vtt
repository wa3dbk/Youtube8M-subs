00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.670
 Subtitles that appear on the screen are basically the same. However, it is possible that only subtitles will be modified later. 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.670
 The design has been changed by adding a timer function based on the metal house tinplate robot New Gear Robot. 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 It is a video of the new gear robot in the original state. There is a problem with the durability of the mechanism, and the operation sound seems to reflect that, and there is an unpleasant feeling. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.130
 Timer function Starts after a short time when the start button is pressed, and automatically stops after a certain time. This operating time can be changed with the variable resistance (the knob on the shoulder in the next image). 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.600
 Indicates the main part of the timer circuit. This circuit is resistant to noise and momentary voltage drops. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 I removed the two original gears and added geared pistons to that space. The red and white disks are the ones with the small gears attached and the disks stuck on top. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.730
 The hand has been added to the mechanical problems with durability, and the operation sound is softer than the original. The metallic operation sound which is not made of plastic can be said to be one of the tastes of tinplate. 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.000
 When the motor starts, a large current drops the power supply voltage, the voltage display needle briefly lowers, and the eye LED also becomes dark. 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.930
 It is a mechanism of the original state. At first glance, the making was really cheap and there was a problem with durability, and no lubricant was applied. 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:26.930
 The left of the next image is the brass pinion gear attached to the motor, which has been worn out. I replaced it with the same 8T plastic pinion gear on the right and added grease to the entire mechanism. The pinion gear that I replaced was intended for expendables, but then I'll keep it for quite a while. 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.200
 The contact area between the crank shaft moving the foot and the groove on the foot side was rubbed with a large force, and both were slightly scraped. 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:48.270
 The crank shaft has extra length and there is a part that has popped out, so a groove made of a plastic square bar is added to the conventional groove. This is expected to significantly improve the durability, and no trouble has actually occurred since then. The following image shows the original state and this added state. 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:07.730
 Crankshafts and grooves can be made to move grease towards the end by the movement of the crankshaft. The lower part of the body has a notch indicated by an arrow so that this part can be checked and greased later. 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:21.200
 It can be said to the bearing of a crank shaft that a big power is applied. It seems that this is supported only by the thickness of the gear box and there is a structural unreasonableness, and it was actually scraped off. 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:34.270
 In order to reinforce the bearing of the crank shaft, the epoxy adhesive shown in the arrow in the following image is embedded around the straight part of the crank shaft to make it a bearing (not shown, but the other side of the gear box is also There is). I have previously applied grease to the crank shaft that is not good for bonding. When the hole is expanded, you need to be careful about positioning. 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:47.270
 In the original, the battery was 2 single batteries, but 2 AA nickel hydrogen batteries were used. In addition, LEDs such as red, green and yellow are voltages that can be used at the last moment, but blue and white are impossible. 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:56.270
 In the original, the "antenna" that moves in conjunction with the hand came out from the left and right shoulders, but this was deleted. The bracket at the base can be turned, and it can be lowered to prevent going out as in the following image. 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.400
 I didn't like the original face, but I made it using the ice cream lid. It is made of metal by painting and tape. 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.130
 The paint is inferior to the previous product and peels off easily. The durability of the mechanism is also so, and it seems that the quality is falling due to the unreasonable cost reduction as a whole. 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:32.130
 The paint for repair that had been peeled off was “Tamiya acrylic paint”, which is a paint for models. The robot's color was not primary red, but red, and yellow was added to red little by little to create a similar color. 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:38.200
 I tried to put an aluminum plate on which the trial color of the primary color red (left side) and the created amber color (right side) was applied on the robot. 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.200
 It is a variation with a transparent dome.
