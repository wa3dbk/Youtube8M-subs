00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.240 

it<00:00:29.420> goes<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.750> little<00:00:29.990> something<00:00:30.140> like<00:00:30.590> this<00:00:30.650> tea

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
it goes a little something like this tea

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.100 
it goes a little something like this tea
I<00:00:32.239> don't<00:00:32.390> believe<00:00:32.510> in<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.689> public<00:00:32.960> school

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
I don't believe in the public school

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.290 
I don't believe in the public school
education<00:00:33.170> I<00:00:33.800> think<00:00:34.309> it<00:00:34.400> perpetuates<00:00:34.820> failure

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
education I think it perpetuates failure

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.360 
education I think it perpetuates failure
but<00:00:35.809> I<00:00:35.870> know<00:00:36.050> there's<00:00:36.380> good<00:00:36.620> teachers<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.309> I

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
but I know there's good teachers and I

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.880 
but I know there's good teachers and I
know<00:00:37.430> there's<00:00:37.790> some<00:00:38.540> good<00:00:38.750> things<00:00:39.080> going<00:00:39.620> on

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
know there's some good things going on

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.460 
know there's some good things going on
but<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:40.160> think<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.699> teachers<00:00:41.120> have<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.260> work

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
but I think the teachers have to work

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.530 
but I think the teachers have to work
against<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.100> system<00:00:43.340> because<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.090> system

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
against the system because the system

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.110 
against the system because the system
they're<00:00:44.690> putting<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:45.199> is<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:45.620> whole<00:00:46.489> testing

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
they're putting in is this whole testing

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.689 
they're putting in is this whole testing
system<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:47.930> think<00:00:48.500> it's<00:00:48.620> incredibly<00:00:48.920> important

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
system I think it's incredibly important

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.340 
system I think it's incredibly important
that<00:00:49.820> people<00:00:50.120> send<00:00:50.420> their<00:00:50.510> kids<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.809> public

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
that people send their kids to public

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.400 
that people send their kids to public
schools<00:00:51.830> I<00:00:52.129> think<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.000> what<00:00:53.960> makes<00:00:54.170> the

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
schools I think the what makes the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.200 
schools I think the what makes the
difference<00:00:54.590> at<00:00:54.980> Hope<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.400> the<00:00:55.519> diversity<00:00:55.879> of

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
difference at Hope is the diversity of

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.290 
difference at Hope is the diversity of
the<00:00:56.390> student<00:00:56.510> body<00:00:56.900> it's<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.159> I<00:00:58.460> think<00:00:58.699> very

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
the student body it's and I think very

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.270 
the student body it's and I think very
often<00:00:59.629> people<00:01:00.050> do<00:01:00.350> not<00:01:00.500> realize<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:01.040> that's

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
often people do not realize that that's

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:13.600 
often people do not realize that that's
the<00:01:01.519> welcome<00:01:12.159> how<00:01:13.159> do<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.250> guys<00:01:13.370> feel<00:01:13.430> about
