00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
is an amazing move that has basically

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
is an amazing move that has basically
two<00:00:25.500> versions<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.220> which<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.460> charge<00:00:26.699> up

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
two versions one in which you charge up

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.570 
two versions one in which you charge up
and<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.930> which<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.590> fly<00:00:28.800> let<00:00:29.160> let<00:00:29.460> it

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and one in which you just fly let let it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.279 
and one in which you just fly let let it
fly<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.029> has<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.570> slightly<00:00:30.929> slower<00:00:31.170> than

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
fly and it has it's slightly slower than

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.450 
fly and it has it's slightly slower than
a<00:00:31.439> regular<00:00:31.470> Galaga

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
a regular Galaga

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.450 
a regular Galaga
alright<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.350> first<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> applying

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
alright so the first way of applying

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
alright so the first way of applying
this<00:00:35.700> move<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.780> opponent<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this move is when your opponent is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
this move is when your opponent is
attacking<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.890> crazy<00:00:38.160> non-stop<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
attacking you all crazy non-stop you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
attacking you all crazy non-stop you
push<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> move<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.680> immediately<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> has

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
push out the move and immediately it has

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.970 
push out the move and immediately it has
a<00:00:41.460> frame<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.090> stagger<00:00:42.870> armor<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.829> your

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
a frame of stagger armor and if your

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.670 
a frame of stagger armor and if your
opponent<00:00:44.370> tries<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.789> escape<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.329> run<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:46.500> try

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
opponent tries to escape or run they try

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
opponent tries to escape or run they try
to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.890> anything<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.460> snap<00:00:47.730> vanish<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:49.079> will

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to do anything but snap vanish they will

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
to do anything but snap vanish they will
get<00:00:49.410> hit<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> very<00:00:50.700> tight<00:00:50.910> timing

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
get hit now there is a very tight timing

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
get hit now there is a very tight timing
where<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.320> ascend<00:00:52.829> or

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
where they can also just ascend or

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.330 
where they can also just ascend or
decent<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.090> timing<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.750> tight<00:00:55.020> it's

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
decent but that timing is so tight it's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.860 
decent but that timing is so tight it's
almost<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.579> even<00:00:56.610> worth<00:00:56.969> trying<00:00:57.210> also

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
almost not even worth trying also

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
almost not even worth trying also
because<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> large<00:00:58.859> hit<00:00:59.039> boxes<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.579> they

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
because of the large hit boxes if they

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.849 
because of the large hit boxes if they
do<00:00:59.879> snap<00:01:00.510> vanish<00:01:00.809> behind<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> time

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
do snap vanish behind you at the time

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.529 
do snap vanish behind you at the time
that<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> release<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> move<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:03.329> will

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that you release the move they will

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.350 
that you release the move they will
still<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:04.049> hit<00:01:04.489> now<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
still get hit now that is not the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.050 
still get hit now that is not the
guarantee<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.460> easy<00:01:08.520> way

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
guarantee that is just a very easy way

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.250 
guarantee that is just a very easy way
to<00:01:09.119> hit<00:01:09.299> somebody<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> heat<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.229> battle

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
to hit somebody in the heat of battle

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.770 
to hit somebody in the heat of battle
because<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.159> hard<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.549> dodge<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.000> move<00:01:12.150> when

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
because it's hard to dodge the move when

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.260 
because it's hard to dodge the move when
you<00:01:12.900> try<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.310> move<00:01:14.610> around<00:01:14.850> or

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you try to actually just move around or

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.700 
you try to actually just move around or
move<00:01:15.420> away<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.110> ascending<00:01:16.590> or

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
move away if you're not ascending or

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070 
move away if you're not ascending or
descending<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.150> hit<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
descending you will get hit with it the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
descending you will get hit with it the
interesting<00:01:19.530> thing<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.820> knock<00:01:21.030> your

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
interesting thing is if you knock your

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
interesting thing is if you knock your
opponent<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> ground<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.890> Tec<00:01:23.220> roll

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.420 
opponent to the ground and they Tec roll
and<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.180> time<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.689> correctly<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.130> always

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and you time it correctly it will always

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.600 
and you time it correctly it will always
hit<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.330> want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> shoot<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> move<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:29.520> want

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
hit you want to shoot the move you want

hit you want to shoot the move you want
to<00:01:29.729> charge<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:31.079> let<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.640> as

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to charge it up and let it go just as

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.630 
to charge it up and let it go just as
they're<00:01:33.299> actually<00:01:33.840> still<00:01:34.380> moving<00:01:34.829> into<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
they're actually still moving into the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.660 
they're actually still moving into the
the<00:01:36.479> roll<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.430> will
