00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.100
 about IT gaming welcome South East in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 this brand new review review 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.400
 dedicated inside helmet warrior 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.110
 exotic for the Titan class 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
 introduced with the wolf family 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.290
 I state that for various reasons 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.389
 I 'll go expose you in this video 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.920
 I hate this helmet I hate it with everything 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.570
 same and bothers me that for the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 class the titan always make pieces 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.769
 more fake armor than useless and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 features that open my render 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.160
 there are very few useful helmets 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.539
 such as statistics that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.980
 it will indeed offer to give intellects 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.750
 discipline that however also on the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 Titan class are always the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.410
 best two statistics to increase 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.300
 especially with the subclass of the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 jumper that would be the subclass with 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 which this helmet should be used for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.940
 as regards instead as for the al 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.649
 usually it will be three, the first is shadow 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.270
 reverse that will increase super energy 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.340
 provided by the killings of monsters of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.719
 Darkness in plain English and in pv 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820
 get more super energy when 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.129
 kill someone does not count in pvp 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 so it's ok here it's a good reason why 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.610
 it uses a lot but with a helmet that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.559
 would have used mainly in the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 pvp there is a why that does not work in the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 pvp and this thing makes no sense 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.260
 the second because instead it will be in fusion 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.400
 which will allow you to restore the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.320
 your health every time 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 you will collect a sphere of light because 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 which as we have already got to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.780
 see it was noticed very much during 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 the red of crota removed that but it is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.960
 rarely uses 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.210
 finally the peculiar reason for this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 piece of armor is decided because that there 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.360
 will provide the unstoppable bonus ability 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.640
 that you can choose alternatively 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.140
 to the shoulder loaded and how 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.970
 effect will provide you greater 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 resistance when you use fist 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.720
 of destruction because casey will be there 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.280
 useful to survive maybe when 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.780
 also use a destruction in the midst of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.369
 enemies that have already seen you and that you 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.110
 they are trying to kill but in the end 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.909
 end you must get there without it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 obviously use the punch then there 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.180
 you will not have a greater resistance e 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.950
 it will work simply when 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.740
 you will use apulia this effect yes 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.909
 takes advantage of once in a million 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.950
 literally also this because 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.320
 useful mainly in the brief because 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.329
 however in the PD it is rarely indeed almost 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.189
 they will never kill while you use punch 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.990
 of destruction and combined with this 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.030
 because there are other skills than almost 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.860
 in the pvp not just a non-exploit is exploited 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.780
 you could 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.970
 use while the other is almost 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.010
 never beyond that we add there is also 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.110
 an aesthetic defect in fact this helmet 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.030
 not half with no shader does not change 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 color and very few shaders that 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.960
 be happy with this helmet conclusions 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.070
 strongly discouraged 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.380
 I'm sorry but it turns out to be 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.040
 practically useless in 99 percent 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.780
 of cases 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.120
 all that can be saved concerns 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.320
 the pvp because in the end the bonus 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.450
 unstoppable you can use 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.190
 together with the shoulder loaded schalken 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.600
 matt and that time out of a million yes 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.430
 exploits that the problem however in the end 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.230
 this is exactly what this helmet is 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.459
 it uses very little compared to 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.040
 lots of other pieces of armor 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.840
 exotic and therefore not boys for how much 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.950
 concerns the interior warrior as everything 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.480
 as usual I thank you for yours 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.920
