until now so hope this is still useful
to<00:00:50.100> people<00:00:50.129> um<00:00:53.930> i<00:00:54.930> won't<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.680> won't<00:00:55.829> rehash

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
to people um i won't i won't rehash

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.510 
to people um i won't i won't rehash
everything<00:00:57.469> from<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.980> original<00:00:59.399> review

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
everything from the the original review

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.410 
everything from the the original review
but<00:01:00.949> basically<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.789> held<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.149> really

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
but basically it's it's held up really

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.090 
but basically it's it's held up really
well<00:01:04.009> i'm<00:01:05.009> still<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.700> happy<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:07.100> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
well i'm still really happy with it you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.870 
well i'm still really happy with it you
can<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> little<00:01:08.880> bit<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> wear<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.300> tear

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
can see a little bit of wear and tear

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
can see a little bit of wear and tear
right<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.630> sure<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
right there not sure if you can see the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
right there not sure if you can see the
shadow<00:01:14.090> but<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.720> material<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:17.780> separating<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
shadow but the material is separating a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.640 
shadow but the material is separating a
little<00:01:19.049> bit<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> internal<00:01:21.650> whatever

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
little bit from the internal whatever

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.179 
little bit from the internal whatever
creating<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.700> stiffness<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.630> i<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
creating that stiffness which i think is

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.609 
creating that stiffness which i think is
cardboard<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:26.490> something<00:01:27.290> but<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.380> doesn't

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
cardboard or something but it doesn't

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.219 
cardboard or something but it doesn't
know<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.920> doesn't<00:01:29.159> affect<00:01:29.430> anything<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.900> of

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
know it doesn't affect anything and of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
know it doesn't affect anything and of
course<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.270> can't<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.659> this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
course it is you can't see it in this

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.100 
course it is you can't see it in this
light<00:01:33.960> probably<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.400> does<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.900> does

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
light probably but it does it does

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.819 
light probably but it does it does
eventually<00:01:37.350> kind<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.130> pick<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.759> dirt<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
eventually kind of pick up some dirt and

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.420 
eventually kind of pick up some dirt and
smudging

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
smudging

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.790 
smudging
so<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.480> is<00:01:42.510> so<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.050> not<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.290> clean<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
so there is so it's not as clean as it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.390 
so there is so it's not as clean as it
was<00:01:44.550> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> beginning<00:01:45.230> I<00:01:46.230> did<00:01:46.650> try<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.160> a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
was in the beginning I did try to get a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.210 
was in the beginning I did try to get a
black<00:01:47.880> version<00:01:48.120> from<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.930> cali<00:01:49.170> requesting<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
black version from a cali requesting a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.420 
black version from a cali requesting a
review<00:01:50.730> unit<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.290> never<00:01:52.440> got<00:01:52.740> they

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
review unit but they never got they

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.430 
review unit but they never got they
never<00:01:53.580> got<00:01:53.760> back<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.150> me<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.320> would

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
never got back to me so that would

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.630 
never got back to me so that would
probably<00:01:55.560> cover<00:01:56.660> cover<00:01:57.660> up<00:01:57.840> any<00:01:58.050> dirt<00:01:58.320> better

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
probably cover cover up any dirt better

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.660 
probably cover cover up any dirt better
still<00:01:59.640> I've<00:02:00.270> taken<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.229> taking<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.190> pad<00:02:02.430> out

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
still I've taken the taking the pad out

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.810 
still I've taken the taking the pad out
several<00:02:03.030> times<00:02:03.830> especially<00:02:04.830> for<00:02:05.340> charging

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
several times especially for charging

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.710 
several times especially for charging
the<00:02:05.970> dock<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:08.310> still<00:02:08.670> snaps<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.390> really

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the dock and it still snaps in really

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.250 
the dock and it still snaps in really
tight<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.740> put<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.070> there<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.950> there<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.070> go

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
tight just put in there and there you go

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.800 
tight just put in there and there you go
again<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.680> said<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.040> original<00:02:17.280> enter

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
again like I said the original enter

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.710 
again like I said the original enter
review<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.770> don't<00:02:20.340> recommend<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.600> know

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
review I don't recommend you know

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.949 
review I don't recommend you know
flailing<00:02:22.590> about<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.120> doesn't<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.930> a

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
flailing about it it doesn't have a

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.870 
flailing about it it doesn't have a
super<00:02:25.380> firm<00:02:25.620> grip<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:27.380> completely

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
super firm grip but it's it's completely

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.750 
super firm grip but it's it's completely
sufficient<00:02:29.880> for<00:02:30.450> keeping<00:02:31.050> into<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.709> pad<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
sufficient for keeping into the pad the

sufficient for keeping into the pad the
the<00:02:35.760> one<00:02:36.120> thing<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.750> am<00:02:37.050> starting<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.800> notice<00:02:38.010> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the one thing I am starting to notice a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.870 
the one thing I am starting to notice a
little<00:02:38.459> bit<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.670> little

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
little bit is now that the little

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.210 
little bit is now that the little
leather<00:02:42.060> tongue<00:02:42.510> has<00:02:43.110> broken<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.190> little

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
leather tongue has broken in a little

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.720 
leather tongue has broken in a little
bit<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:45.180> actually<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.690> little<00:02:45.900> harder<00:02:46.730> to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
bit it's actually a little harder to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.810 
bit it's actually a little harder to
slide<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.810> sometimes<00:02:49.470> sometimes<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.549> wants

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
slide it in sometimes sometimes it wants

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.920 
slide it in sometimes sometimes it wants
to<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:53.030> instead<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.390> straight<00:02:54.450> in

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
to do that instead of going straight in
