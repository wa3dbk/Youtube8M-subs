00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:22.400
Daddy, when are we finally there?
Now, when will we be there?
Are we there yet?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.440
We have just taken off now
and already you're starting to complain

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.280
I'm trying to drive as fast as I can
as fast as I can

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.200
How much longer does it take

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.760
I'm on my last leg

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.440
How much longer?

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.560
You could count all red cars

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.920
or try an even funnier game

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.600
Then you don't have to torture us anymore
don't torture us

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.240
I have tried all that already
and nothing has happened yet

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.920
nothing's happened

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.480
I'm through with all my books

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.400
the earphones are falling out of my ears

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.440
I don't want to paint any more pictures

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.160
I'm bored!!!

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.120
Don't make such a fuss

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.240
We are really close now
really close already

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.480
Why don't you close your ears for a while
maybe you'll fall asleep and we're there in a second

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.680
Then we would have some peace and quiet
what do you say?

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.000
Travelling is frustrating for kids
nobody likes long drives

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.520
you knew it all along!

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.600
Come on, it can't be that bad
next time we'll stay at home

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.200
But all of the sudden we all realize:

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.680
We're there!
