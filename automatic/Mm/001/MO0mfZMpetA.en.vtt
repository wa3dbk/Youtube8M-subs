00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
highlight words so I highlight that word

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.190

options the first option is to copy it
to<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.480> clipboard<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.990> you<00:03:54.050> can<00:03:54.170> use<00:03:54.290> it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
to the clipboard so you can use it

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.650 
to the clipboard so you can use it
somewhere<00:03:54.560> else<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.070> device<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:56.360> second

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
somewhere else in the device the second

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.850 
somewhere else in the device the second
option<00:03:56.750> just<00:03:56.930> there<00:03:57.140> is<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.320> magnifying<00:03:57.770> glass
