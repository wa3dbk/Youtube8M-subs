00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.480 
let's say instead of rice noodles you
could<00:04:55.320> switch<00:04:55.560> in<00:04:55.770> for<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.130> whole<00:04:56.310> grain

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
could switch in for the whole grain

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.950 
could switch in for the whole grain
noodles<00:04:56.640> if<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:56.970> choose<00:04:57.210> help<00:04:57.450> you're<00:04:57.630> over

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
switch those out for different ones and

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.180 
switch those out for different ones and
many<00:05:51.480> times<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.140> was<00:05:52.350> just<00:05:52.440> a<00:05:52.590> little<00:05:52.860> bit<00:05:52.980> of

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
many times that was just a little bit of

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.880 
many times that was just a little bit of
Parmesan<00:05:53.940> cheese<00:05:54.300> this<00:05:55.230> here<00:05:55.410> is<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.530> sampling

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
Parmesan cheese this here is a sampling

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.100 
Parmesan cheese this here is a sampling
of<00:05:56.070> our<00:05:56.220> square<00:05:56.670> Bowl<00:05:56.910> which<00:05:57.150> is<00:05:57.330> it's<00:05:57.990> enough

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
of our square Bowl which is it's enough

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.350 
of our square Bowl which is it's enough
to<00:05:58.350> feed<00:05:58.500> four<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.830> six<00:05:59.040> people<00:05:59.280> and<00:05:59.670> it's

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
actually so many so many vegetables that

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.470 
actually so many so many vegetables that
it's<00:06:03.900> hard<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.200> put<00:06:04.470> a<00:06:04.500> lid<00:06:04.740> on<00:06:04.770> it<00:06:04.920> so<00:06:05.280> yeah<00:06:05.910> you

believe in doubt you just open a new

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.490 
believe in doubt you just open a new
location<00:06:08.640> here<00:06:08.940> at<00:06:09.600> university<00:06:10.080> village<00:06:10.110> so

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
location here at university village so
