importance<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.240> drawing<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.870> architects<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
importance of drawing for architects and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.340 
importance of drawing for architects and
designers<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.630> distinguish<00:00:18.630> between<00:00:18.810> three

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
designers I distinguish between three

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.010 
designers I distinguish between three
types<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.859> architectural<00:00:20.580> drawing<00:00:21.020> sketching

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
types of architectural drawing sketching

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.259

of our environment design drawing and
presentational<00:00:25.170> drawing<00:00:25.849> sketching<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
presentational drawing sketching is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
presentational drawing sketching is
mostly<00:00:27.390> observation<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.289> our<00:00:28.439> environment

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010

communication between an architect and
the<00:00:37.590> general<00:00:37.950> public<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.610> believe<00:00:39.480> as

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the general public I believe as

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
the general public I believe as
architects<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.559> designers<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.579> all

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
architects and designers have to use all

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.990 
architects and designers have to use all
three<00:00:42.500> now<00:00:43.500> let's<00:00:43.770> look<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.129> why<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
three now let's look at why is it so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.290 
three now let's look at why is it so
important<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.570> us<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.079> draw<00:00:46.730> firstly<00:00:47.730> drawing

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
important for us to draw firstly drawing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.619 
important for us to draw firstly drawing
is<00:00:48.629> thinking<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.309> visual<00:00:50.789> recording<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
is thinking it is a visual recording of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
is thinking it is a visual recording of
our<00:00:51.780> thoughts<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> certain<00:00:52.770> moment<00:00:52.850> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
our thoughts at a certain moment this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
our thoughts at a certain moment this
goes<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.329> sketching<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> environment<00:00:55.530> as

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
goes for sketching the environment as

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.000 
goes for sketching the environment as
well<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.190> design<00:00:56.579> sketches<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.329> sketch<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.620> also

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
well as design sketches a sketch is also

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
well as design sketches a sketch is also
one<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> important<00:00:59.910> tools<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.329> design<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
one of the important tools of design it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.680 
one of the important tools of design it
is<00:01:01.500> an<00:01:01.680> indispensable<00:01:02.520> tool<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:03.270> imagining

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
is an indispensable tool for imagining

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
is an indispensable tool for imagining
3d<00:01:04.140> space<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> 2d<00:01:05.220> surface<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:06.360> allows<00:01:06.720> us<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
3d space on a 2d surface it allows us to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
3d space on a 2d surface it allows us to
think<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.040> space<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.640> an<00:01:08.760> abstract<00:01:09.119> way

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
think about the space in an abstract way

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.920 
think about the space in an abstract way
secondly<00:01:11.040> through<00:01:11.670> sketching<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.390> collect<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
secondly through sketching we collect a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
secondly through sketching we collect a
visual<00:01:13.290> library<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.920> forms<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.880> can

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
visual library of forms that we can

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
visual library of forms that we can
later<00:01:15.240> use<00:01:15.420> consciously<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.320> subconsciously

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
later use consciously or subconsciously

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.330 
later use consciously or subconsciously
in<00:01:17.549> our<00:01:17.729> design<00:01:18.119> our<00:01:19.080> environment<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.009> rich

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
in our design our environment is rich

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
in our design our environment is rich
with<00:01:20.490> patterns<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.299> shapes<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.409> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
with patterns and shapes and it is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
with patterns and shapes and it is
especially<00:01:22.830> interesting<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.000> explore<00:01:24.390> new

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
especially interesting to explore new

an understand war we can see and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.219 
an understand war we can see and
understand<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.509> landscape<00:01:36.990> with

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
computer renderings it is also important

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.950 
computer renderings it is also important
to<00:02:35.250> explore<00:02:35.730> different<00:02:36.030> drawing<00:02:36.480> techniques

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
to explore different drawing techniques

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.620 
to explore different drawing techniques
they<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:38.070> only<00:02:38.280> give<00:02:38.730> us<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.060> variety<00:02:39.240> of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
they not only give us a variety of

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.740 
they not only give us a variety of
different<00:02:39.930> recording<00:02:40.650> possibilities<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:42.210> by

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
different recording possibilities but by

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.330 
different recording possibilities but by
choosing<00:02:43.050> different<00:02:43.200> techniques<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.070> drawing

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
choosing different techniques in drawing

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.340 
choosing different techniques in drawing
will<00:02:45.030> reveal<00:02:45.270> something<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.990> how<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.230> choose

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
will reveal something of how we choose

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.910 
will reveal something of how we choose
to<00:02:46.620> see<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.040> landscape<00:02:47.670> or<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.940> object

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
to see the landscape or the object

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.350 
to see the landscape or the object
therefore<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.100> choice<00:02:50.460> of<00:02:50.670> drawing<00:02:50.940> technique

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
therefore a choice of drawing technique

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.580 
therefore a choice of drawing technique
is<00:02:51.600> also<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> result<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.709> our<00:02:52.830> perception<00:02:53.550> I

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
is also a result of our perception I

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.199 
is also a result of our perception I
hope<00:02:55.590> these<00:02:55.800> reasons<00:02:56.340> will<00:02:56.520> encourage<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> to
