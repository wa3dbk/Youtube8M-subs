00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 Hi everyone I am friends and welcome to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.260
 this new tutorial in this video vi 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.780
 I will teach you to build a portal that is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 active and deactivated to ours 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.780
 will 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.520
 and all this based on a lever then 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.230
 let's see immediately how it worked 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.340
 the lever is deactivated the portal 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.470
 disabled 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 if the lever is activated, this is activated 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.849
 that son torch is the portal is activated e 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 we try to disable it we turn off the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.710
 lever the portal deactivates the lash 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.160
 it turns off and the beauty of it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.980
 portal is the beauty of this creation or 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 call it what you want it's that easy 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
 to build so let's see 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.899
 how to do it but above all of course there 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.239
 need a portal and let's go with the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.210
 mirrors we build a portal without doing 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.239
 the saving mode 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 now let's put in here I don't know who it is me 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.000
 they call 2 dispenser portal holes 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.590
 and I recommend not having to map to spencer 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.680
 this way here 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.320
 then we put a lever here and back 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.979
 the lever we put the block any that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 obviously you do n't have banana gloss and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.909
 let's put a recent piece on a piece that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.520
 I am here above a limit set at 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.409
 second tic a repeat link to the first tic 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:29.640
 a lock any rexton torch recite 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:35.400
 and I remain a match with the peter al 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 third tic marton block and i don't know how 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.920
 tell you guys but we've already finished 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.550
 this is the greatest universal crap 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.140
 never existed to be built in minecraft 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.580
 yes in the sense relationship length and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 quantity that I have to build because of 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.700
 this is usually so cool 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.010
 you get a casino instead look 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.230
 here that cool and now let's see if 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.740
 works in the left handouts 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.660
 we have to put a bucket 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.320
 of water while in the larders 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.300
 now we have to put a lighter 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.870
 now if we are particularly rich 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.360
 we can put more lighters for 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.420
 save it to reassure us that the portal 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.210
 work as long as possible 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.060
 now let's activate the lever here you see the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.780
 portal activates deactivates a lever e 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.270
 as you can see the portal is deactivated now 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.400
 for those like me who want to add the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.410
 indication torch which is not that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.160
 it has great utility, however, it is figure 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.730
 see at this point simple then 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.190
 we add the block above this ipt 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.790
 above that a car is stuck here 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.570
 let's put an area and block block 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.420
 gladstone and peter pouring us put 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.310
 in thor squa and we have already finished too 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.050
 the action torch then we activate yes 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.810
 activates the ariston torch activates the 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.930
 portal disable we deactivate the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.690
 santos deactivates the portal is the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.670
 tutorial ends here already because that's all 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 here so I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.209
 maybe you wonder how it works 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.640
 I usually don't do the video explanation 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.820
 same but since it is so short 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 Let's do it then let's do what 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.700
 it happens practically then we leave 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.590
 immediately after the fact what happens when 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.560
 let's activate a lever then that 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.550
 activate the lever this piece is activated 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.540
 that I am here and this I think I am here 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.970
 activate this 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.709
 oh well now I have destroyed a bit of everything 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:48.270
 but I activate this cube here I don't know if 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.210
 did you know but when I want to 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.570
 this is what this active lesson is here 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:58.980
 this cube therefore hypothetically if I 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.900
 put a piston here you see that the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.850
 piston if you like just because the cube 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.460
 is activated by the achieved then 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.780
 we continue to destroy everything though 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.910
 oh well they are things that happen of nothing 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.550
 let's try to put everything away then 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.880
 put a torch and put the rap 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:24.480
 ater and let's see if we can fix something 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.500
 ok perfect and so this e 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.210
 switching 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.920
 now let's move on to carefree then 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:39.840
 turn on the water happens when 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:44.220
 then we push part here up to the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.620
 stone torch is a kind of pulse leaf 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.040
 meter but I'll show you what it's for 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.050
 this step above all I will explain to you what it is 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.660
 now the pass restricts it built in 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.760
 this way here is the cube there is the red 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.640
 dawn you have it so much that it will depend 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.000
 second degree there repeats us to the first 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.620
 degree is the cube and we do so and so 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.510
 there is the torch 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.060
 now the output but here and there would be 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.430
 been dispensed so let's go and see 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.880
 what happens when we deactivate the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.360
 lever 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.180
 look at this very quickly 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.720
 piece of age here is activated and yes 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.320
 deactivate so it practically happens 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.290
 that this torch here when we go 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.770
 to deactivate the lever it is activated and yes 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:37.110
 off for a fraction of a second 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:40.590
 ft of Lazio and it happens that it goes to 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.350
 activate this pantry here and with a little 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.860
 of delay he goes to reactivate it there 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.440
 I show without dispensations so you can 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.230
 see clearly that it lights up first 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.830
 this and then turn that vintages on 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.150
 be careful 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.760
 all new so this is for 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.200
 activate pantry twice because if 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.020
 we only activated it once 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.120
 the water would just come out and we want to 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.920
 that the water comes out to destroy the 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.830
 portal because when the water comes out it does 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.780
 so ta and destroy the portal and after 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.600
 we want a split second 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.290
 after the water re-enters then we give it a 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.620
 second signal that reactivates the dispensations 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.740
 and therefore to have the water withdrawn e 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.540
 this is the simple operation of 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.090
 I think this portal is rather 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.710
 brilliant and for a long time I wanted 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.750
 build such a man but not 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.640
 I never had the chance because i 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.790
 handouts did not have this functionality 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.270
 so now they have it so let's take advantage of it 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.310
 yes I hope you enjoyed the video if 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.560
 you have not understood an explanation 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.150
 tell me maybe I'll try to do it better 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.640
 because I explained it very quickly 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.170
 so I hope I was clear from 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.590
 that point of view 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:07:01.440
 and if you are interested if you are interested i 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.440
 my tutorials sign up and see you 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.320
 video
