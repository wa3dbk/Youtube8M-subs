considered more valuable than gold

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.609 
considered more valuable than gold
when<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> Spaniards<00:00:21.090> found<00:00:21.600> cacao<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.470> they

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
brought this to Europe this would just

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.429 
be food for the kings and queens for
royalty<00:00:28.250> very<00:00:29.250> nutritional<00:00:29.789> food<00:00:30.349> problem<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
royalty very nutritional food problem is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.360 
royalty very nutritional food problem is
that<00:00:31.619> nowadays<00:00:32.930> when<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.440> consume<00:00:34.800> cacao

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that nowadays when when we consume cacao

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.090 
that nowadays when when we consume cacao
products<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.750> normally<00:00:37.200> contain<00:00:37.620> sugar

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
products they normally contain sugar

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
products they normally contain sugar
dairy<00:00:38.719> peanuts<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.200> such<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.469> it's<00:00:43.469> difficult

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
dairy peanuts and such so it's difficult

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.299 
dairy peanuts and such so it's difficult
getting<00:00:43.920> raw<00:00:44.309> cacao<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.620> actually<00:00:46.620> raw<00:00:46.860> cacao

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
getting raw cacao and actually raw cacao

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.090 
getting raw cacao and actually raw cacao
is<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:48.140> has<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.860> highest<00:00:50.430> content<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
is what has the highest content of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.510 
is what has the highest content of
nutrients<00:00:53.100> vitamins<00:00:53.360> minerals<00:00:54.360> antioxidants

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
nutrients vitamins minerals antioxidants

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.450 
nutrients vitamins minerals antioxidants
so<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.850> roast<00:00:57.270> them<00:00:57.629> toast<00:00:58.469> them<00:00:58.800> they

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so when we roast them toast them they

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.680 
so when we roast them toast them they
lose<00:00:59.870> many<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> these<00:01:01.489> attributes<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.270> cacao

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
lose many of these attributes that cacao

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.960 
lose many of these attributes that cacao
has

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
has

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.930 
has
and<00:01:05.800> well<00:01:06.800> you<00:01:07.040> know<00:01:07.160> it's<00:01:07.370> very<00:01:07.460> difficult

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
and well you know it's very difficult

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.030 
and well you know it's very difficult
normally<00:01:08.360> you're<00:01:08.450> gonna<00:01:08.600> find<00:01:08.900> roasted<00:01:09.800> taco

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
normally you're gonna find roasted taco

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.940 
normally you're gonna find roasted taco
that's<00:01:10.550> how<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.120> know<00:01:11.210> people<00:01:11.240> normally<00:01:12.020> sell

that's how you know people normally sell

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.450 
that's how you know people normally sell
it<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:13.760> if<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.060> can<00:01:14.660> get<00:01:14.990> just<00:01:15.410> raw<00:01:15.860> cacao

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
it but if you can get just raw cacao

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.760 
it but if you can get just raw cacao
beans<00:01:16.760> it's<00:01:17.390> very<00:01:17.630> easy<00:01:17.990> just<00:01:18.440> soak<00:01:18.740> them

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
beans it's very easy just soak them

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.940 
beans it's very easy just soak them
overnight<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.700> ferment<00:01:20.090> them<00:01:20.360> lightly<00:01:20.990> soak

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
overnight you ferment them lightly soak

overnight you ferment them lightly soak
them<00:01:22.130> overnight<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.910> then<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:23.420> can<00:01:23.600> just

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
them overnight and then you can just

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.410 
them overnight and then you can just
peel<00:01:24.170> them<00:01:24.410> easily<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.580> peel<00:01:26.030> them<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.330> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
peel them easily you peel them in the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.380 
peel them easily you peel them in the
morning<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.190> know<00:01:28.310> it's<00:01:28.490> it's<00:01:29.030> super

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
morning it's you know it's it's super

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.650 
morning it's you know it's it's super
easy<00:01:29.840> it's<00:01:30.680> easier<00:01:31.100> than<00:01:31.220> roasting<00:01:31.760> them<00:01:31.940> but

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
easy it's easier than roasting them but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.640 
easy it's easier than roasting them but
unfortunately<00:01:33.190> they<00:01:34.570> you'll<00:01:35.570> normally<00:01:36.110> find

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
unfortunately they you'll normally find

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.720 
unfortunately they you'll normally find
them<00:01:36.890> roasted<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.950> if<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.100> benefits<00:01:40.640> that

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
them roasted so if the benefits that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.930 
them roasted so if the benefits that
cacao<00:01:41.180> has<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.140> won't<00:01:42.380> find<00:01:42.680> in<00:01:43.100> processed

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
cacao has you won't find in processed

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.900 
cacao has you won't find in processed
chocolates<00:01:44.480> that<00:01:44.570> have<00:01:44.960> more<00:01:45.260> sugar<00:01:45.680> than

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
chocolates that have more sugar than

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.180 
chocolates that have more sugar than
chocolate<00:01:46.910> than<00:01:47.240> cacao

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
chocolate than cacao

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.420 
chocolate than cacao
but<00:01:49.190> anyways<00:01:49.990> cacao<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.470> very<00:01:52.070> rich<00:01:52.400> in

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
but anyways cacao is very rich in

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.990 
but anyways cacao is very rich in
magnesium<00:01:53.350> magnesium<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.979> actually<00:01:55.490> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
magnesium magnesium is actually the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.490 
magnesium magnesium is actually the
mineral<00:01:56.510> that<00:01:56.540> a<00:01:57.020> most<00:01:57.920> standard<00:01:58.640> diets<00:01:59.060> lack

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
mineral that a most standard diets lack

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.260 
mineral that a most standard diets lack
most<00:02:00.500> people<00:02:00.920> don't<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.460> enough<00:02:01.790> magnesium

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
most people don't have enough magnesium

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.100 
most people don't have enough magnesium
and<00:02:03.070> cacao<00:02:04.070> provides<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.600> very<00:02:05.930> good

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and cacao provides it's a very good

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.520 
and cacao provides it's a very good
source<00:02:06.440> of<00:02:06.590> magnesium<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:08.780> little<00:02:09.110> I'm

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
source of magnesium and this little I'm

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.080 
source of magnesium and this little I'm
going<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.830> show<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.010> this<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.640> cacao

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
going to show you this is the cacao

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.190 
going to show you this is the cacao
cacao<00:02:11.750> beans

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
cacao beans

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.330 
cacao beans
so<00:02:13.330> actually<00:02:14.330> magnesium<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.380> very<00:02:15.890> good<00:02:16.100> for

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
so actually magnesium is very good for

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.750 
so actually magnesium is very good for
for<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.150> whole<00:02:17.920> circular<00:02:18.920> system<00:02:19.250> for<00:02:19.670> the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
for the whole circular system for the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.420 
for the whole circular system for the
heart<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.300> brain<00:02:20.600> for<00:02:21.380> for<00:02:21.920> developing

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
heart for the brain for for developing

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.030 
heart for the brain for for developing
flexibility<00:02:23.500> substantial<00:02:24.500> magnesium<00:02:24.950> is

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
flexibility substantial magnesium is

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.280 
flexibility substantial magnesium is
essential<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.420> most<00:02:26.600> processed<00:02:27.080> food

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
essential and the most processed food

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.070 
essential and the most processed food
don't<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.860> magnesium<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.209> cattle<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.050> a

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
don't have magnesium so cattle is a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.710 
don't have magnesium so cattle is a
great<00:02:30.380> way<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:31.070> getting<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.940> this

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
great way of of getting this this

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.009 
great way of of getting this this
mineral<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:34.250> also<00:02:34.430> has<00:02:34.760> many<00:02:35.360> vitamins<00:02:35.959> like

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
mineral it also has many vitamins like

get some raw cacao because normally when

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.690 
get some raw cacao because normally when
you<00:04:19.110> roast<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.830> loses<00:04:20.010> many<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.580> these

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
you roast it it loses many of these

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.090 
you roast it it loses many of these
properties<00:04:21.140> but<00:04:22.140> still<00:04:22.380> if<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.770> only<00:04:22.920> get

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
properties but still if you can only get

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.180 
properties but still if you can only get
roasted<00:04:23.660> still<00:04:24.660> has<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.230> know<00:04:25.350> some<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:26.040> these

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
roasted still has you know some of these

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.890 
roasted still has you know some of these
things<00:04:26.430> but<00:04:26.790> it's<00:04:27.360> not<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.630> same<00:04:27.840> thing

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
things but it's not the same thing

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.440 
things but it's not the same thing
because<00:04:28.470> for<00:04:28.710> example<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.520> fatty<00:04:29.730> acids<00:04:30.270> get

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
because for example the fatty acids get

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.760 
because for example the fatty acids get
rancid<00:04:31.110> after<00:04:31.890> after<00:04:32.370> roasting<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:33.620> it's<00:04:34.620> not

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
rancid after after roasting and it's not

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.130

it's<00:04:35.220> not<00:04:35.340> healthy<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.720> consume<00:04:37.140> air<00:04:38.100> this

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
it's not healthy to to consume air this
