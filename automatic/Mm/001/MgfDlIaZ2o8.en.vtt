this topic should be viewed from
different<00:03:37.530> perspectives<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.280> mean<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.120> think

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
different perspectives I mean I think

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.630 
different perspectives I mean I think
that<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.410> can<00:03:40.560> interpret<00:03:40.890> management<00:03:41.550> in

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
that you can interpret management in

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.500 
that you can interpret management in
different<00:03:41.970> ways

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
different ways

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.840 
different ways
for<00:03:42.780> example<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.410> an<00:03:43.560> active<00:03:43.860> control<00:03:44.430> or<00:03:44.670> as

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
for example as an active control or as

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.540 
for example as an active control or as
an<00:03:45.000> act<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.300> inspiring<00:03:45.840> people<00:03:46.320> right<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> don't

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
an act of inspiring people right I don't

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.310 
an act of inspiring people right I don't
think<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.120> management<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.750> something<00:03:49.140> which

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
think that management is something which

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.580 
think that management is something which
has<00:03:49.680> has<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.760> control<00:03:51.420> people<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> think

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
has has to control people but I think

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.320 
has has to control people but I think
most<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.280> people<00:03:53.460> out<00:03:53.640> there<00:03:53.790> think<00:03:54.090> that

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
most of the people out there think that

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
most of the people out there think that
this<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:54.900> management<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.940> think<00:03:57.900> that's

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
this is management so I think that's

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.270 
this is management so I think that's
it's<00:03:59.190> maybe<00:03:59.490> time<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.820> rethink<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:01.080> and

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
it's maybe time to rethink it and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.600 
it's maybe time to rethink it and
reframe<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.330> maybe<00:04:03.590> yes<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:04.890> we<00:04:05.340> shouldn't

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
reframe it maybe yes but we shouldn't

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.880 
reframe it maybe yes but we shouldn't
forget<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.510> management<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.170> also<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.680> charge

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
forget that management is also in charge

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.890 
forget that management is also in charge
of<00:04:08.160> creating<00:04:08.370> success<00:04:09.030> for<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.330> company

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
of creating success for the company

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.510 
of creating success for the company
you<00:04:10.140> shouldn't<00:04:10.500> forget<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.770> goals<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.400> the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
you shouldn't forget the goals of the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.730 
you shouldn't forget the goals of the
company<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:12.690> better<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:13.140> management<00:04:13.590> more

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740
