theological significance in that the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.580 
theological significance in that the
answer's<00:01:06.130> no<00:01:06.159> I<00:01:06.400> just<00:01:06.640> simply<00:01:07.180> forgot<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.900> I

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
answer's no I just simply forgot and I

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.630 
answer's no I just simply forgot and I
was<00:01:09.070> writing<00:01:09.760> without<00:01:10.299> a<00:01:10.510> Bible<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.890> me<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.310> I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
was writing without a Bible by me and I

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.150 
was writing without a Bible by me and I
just<00:01:12.940> left<00:01:13.300> those<00:01:13.540> bits<00:01:13.780> out<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.290> having<00:01:14.920> left

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
just left those bits out and having left

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.550 
just left those bits out and having left
it<00:01:15.340> out<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:16.150> couldn't<00:01:16.570> then<00:01:16.780> change<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
it out and I couldn't then change the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.220 
it out and I couldn't then change the
music<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:18.160> make<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.520> fit<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:18.820> I'm<00:01:19.690> afraid<00:01:20.050> it's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
music to make it fit so I'm afraid it's

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
music to make it fit so I'm afraid it's
an<00:01:20.410> incomplete<00:01:20.880> biblical<00:01:21.880> quotation<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
an incomplete biblical quotation and the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.160 
an incomplete biblical quotation and the
soprano<00:01:24.880> soloist<00:01:25.360> introduces<00:01:26.230> this<00:01:26.440> thought

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
soprano soloist introduces this thought

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.610 
soprano soloist introduces this thought
can<00:01:29.170> be<00:01:29.200> sung<00:01:29.680> a<00:01:29.890> little<00:01:30.400> more<00:01:30.700> operatically

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
can be sung a little more operatically

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.340 
can be sung a little more operatically
than<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.830> Paea<00:01:33.370> so<00:01:33.430> it's<00:01:33.970> quite<00:01:34.210> hard<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.870> find

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
than the Paea so it's quite hard to find

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.330 
than the Paea so it's quite hard to find
one<00:01:36.190> soprano<00:01:36.700> who<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:38.110> at<00:01:38.590> home<00:01:38.800> with<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
one soprano who is at home with the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.070 
one soprano who is at home with the
style<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.730> both<00:01:39.970> these<00:01:40.210> movements<00:01:40.870> I<00:01:40.930> mean

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
style of both these movements I mean

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.930 
style of both these movements I mean
basically<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.590> needs<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.860> lyric<00:01:42.130> soprano<00:01:42.520> or<00:01:42.730> it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
basically it needs a lyric soprano or it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.770 
basically it needs a lyric soprano or it
can<00:01:43.150> be<00:01:43.270> done<00:01:43.480> by<00:01:43.690> my<00:01:44.290> boy<00:01:44.500> soprano<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.600> of

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
can be done by my boy soprano but of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.140 
can be done by my boy soprano but of
course<00:01:47.050> it<00:01:47.230> goes<00:01:47.440> up<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.860> top<00:01:48.130> b-flat<00:01:48.670> in<00:01:48.970> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
course it goes up to a top b-flat in the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.350 
course it goes up to a top b-flat in the
solo<00:01:49.510> part<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.640> last<00:01:51.880> thing<00:01:52.330> that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
solo part and that's the last thing that

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.980 
solo part and that's the last thing that
he<00:01:52.990> or<00:01:53.080> she<00:01:53.110> sings<00:01:53.940> from<00:01:54.940> their<00:01:55.090> labors<00:01:55.570> right

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
he or she sings from their labors right

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
he or she sings from their labors right
up<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.380> b-flat<00:01:56.710> there<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:59.020> happened

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
up to b-flat there and that happened

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.080 
up to b-flat there and that happened
purely<00:02:01.000> because<00:02:01.210> when<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.229> was<00:02:02.470> working

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
purely because when I was working

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.039 
purely because when I was working
frantically<00:02:04.090> at<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.300> last<00:02:04.570> minute<00:02:04.960> in

I've absolutely got to write a top

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
so beautifully very practical

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.850 
so beautifully very practical
consideration<00:02:38.060> indeed<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.530> was<00:02:39.710> how

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.080 

and<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:17.170> didn't<00:03:17.440> use<00:03:17.560> any<00:03:17.739> more<00:03:17.920> than<00:03:18.099> that<00:03:18.340> but

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
and I didn't use any more than that but

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.850 
and I didn't use any more than that but
I've<00:03:19.300> just<00:03:19.330> stretched<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:20.080> out<00:03:20.200> very<00:03:20.530> very

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
I've just stretched it out very very

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.760 
I've just stretched it out very very
slowly<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:22.599> is<00:03:22.930> really<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.349> theme<00:03:23.590> of

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
slowly and that is really the theme of

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.670 
slowly and that is really the theme of
the<00:03:23.920> final<00:03:24.310> section<00:03:24.819> where<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:26.319> almost<00:03:26.530> as

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the final section where it's almost as

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.000 
the final section where it's almost as
if<00:03:26.770> time<00:03:27.099> is<00:03:27.310> suspended<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.860> movement<00:03:29.860> is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
if time is suspended the movement is

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.870 
if time is suspended the movement is
slow<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:31.450> are<00:03:31.660> triplets<00:03:32.200> going<00:03:32.620> yeah<00:03:32.920> daddy

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
slow there are triplets going yeah daddy

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.150 
slow there are triplets going yeah daddy
daddy<00:03:34.810> dad<00:03:35.110> daddy<00:03:35.800> on<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.100> harp<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:38.160> guess

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
daddy dad daddy on the harp and I guess

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.940 
daddy dad daddy on the harp and I guess
the<00:03:39.370> influence<00:03:39.970> behind<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.260> music<00:03:41.830> is

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
the influence behind this music is

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.490 
the influence behind this music is
probably<00:03:42.580> Marla<00:03:46.019> interesting<00:03:47.019> he<00:03:47.319> never

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
probably Marla interesting he never

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.740 
probably Marla interesting he never
wrote<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.739> Requiem<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.550> I<00:03:49.299> don't<00:03:49.360> know<00:03:49.569> whether

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
wrote a Requiem and I don't know whether

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.380 
wrote a Requiem and I don't know whether
he'd<00:03:49.989> have<00:03:50.110> approved<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.890> this<00:03:51.100> but<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.610> think

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
he'd have approved of this but I think

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.699 
he'd have approved of this but I think
it's<00:03:52.680> almost<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.130> world<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.360> Adagio<00:03:55.959> from

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
it's almost the world of the Adagio from

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.309 
it's almost the world of the Adagio from
the<00:03:56.799> mala<00:03:57.040> fifth<00:03:57.400> symphony<00:03:57.840> not<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.870> think

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
the mala fifth symphony not I think

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.229 
the mala fifth symphony not I think
something<00:03:59.890> that<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.069> was<00:04:00.250> conscious<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.910> when<00:04:01.209> I

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
something that I was conscious of when I

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.120 
something that I was conscious of when I
wrote<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.750> piece<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.750> that's<00:04:05.380> probably<00:04:05.950> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
wrote the piece but that's probably the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.020 
wrote the piece but that's probably the
world<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.549> inhabits<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:09.250> really<00:04:09.730> brings

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
world it inhabits and this really brings

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.400 
world it inhabits and this really brings
us<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:11.140> very<00:04:11.739> peaceful<00:04:12.630> close<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.049> the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
us to a very peaceful close and the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.890 
us to a very peaceful close and the
theme<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:15.040> opening<00:04:15.489> returns<00:04:16.060> but<00:04:16.450> slowed

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
theme of the opening returns but slowed

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.300 
theme of the opening returns but slowed
down<00:04:17.940> because<00:04:18.940> it's<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.630> recollection<00:04:20.620> one<00:04:21.190> of

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
down because it's a recollection one of

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.550 
down because it's a recollection one of
the<00:04:21.400> things<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:22.450> conductors<00:04:23.050> sometimes<00:04:23.440> do

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
the things that conductors sometimes do

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.360 
the things that conductors sometimes do
wrong<00:04:23.830> with<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.220> piece<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.570> speed<00:04:25.930> up

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
wrong with this piece is to speed up

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.010 
wrong with this piece is to speed up
when<00:04:27.370> we<00:04:27.760> get<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.150> opening<00:04:28.510> theme<00:04:28.750> from

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
when we get the opening theme from

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.659 
when we get the opening theme from
movement<00:04:29.410> one<00:04:29.530> returning<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.250> that's<00:04:30.430> not

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
movement one returning and that's not

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.490 
movement one returning and that's not
supposed<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.180> happen<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:31.810> meant<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.410> be

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
supposed to happen it is meant to be

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.400 
supposed to happen it is meant to be
slower<00:04:32.979> than<00:04:33.669> it<00:04:33.820> was<00:04:34.000> because<00:04:34.539> everything

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
slower than it was because everything

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.820 
slower than it was because everything
has<00:04:35.590> changed<00:04:35.820> we've<00:04:36.820> been<00:04:37.180> through<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:38.620> whole

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
has changed we've been through the whole

has changed we've been through the whole
experience<00:04:39.580> we've<00:04:40.210> travelled<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.260> journey

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
experience we've travelled this journey

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.510 
experience we've travelled this journey
and<00:04:42.070> we've<00:04:43.000> ultimately<00:04:43.660> arrived<00:04:44.200> at<00:04:44.979> eternal

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
and we've ultimately arrived at eternal

and we've ultimately arrived at eternal
peace<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.120> eternal<00:04:46.660> light<00:04:47.289> and<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:49.000> was<00:04:49.150> the

peace and eternal light and that was the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.080 
peace and eternal light and that was the
statement<00:04:49.539> I<00:04:49.810> wanted<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.350> make<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:50.919> it's<00:04:51.789> odd

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
statement I wanted to make and it's odd

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.090 
statement I wanted to make and it's odd
that<00:04:52.479> given<00:04:53.169> that<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:54.190> work<00:04:54.700> had<00:04:55.060> such

that given that the work had such

that given that the work had such
patchwork<00:04:57.100> origins<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:59.800> does<00:05:00.160> actually

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
patchwork origins that it does actually

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.520 
patchwork origins that it does actually
in<00:05:00.880> any<00:05:01.210> sense<00:05:01.539> fit<00:05:01.810> together

in any sense fit together

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.200 
in any sense fit together
I<00:05:02.820> hope<00:05:03.820> perhaps<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.330> does<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:05.070> hope<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.430> in

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
a hundred years ago and what I think I'd

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.310 
a hundred years ago and what I think I'd
say<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.180> that<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:28.460> well<00:05:29.460> first<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.870> text

say to that is well first that the text

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.710 
say to that is well first that the text
of<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.530> Requiem<00:05:31.890> is<00:05:32.130> so<00:05:32.280> timeless<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.600> I

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
of the Requiem is so timeless that I

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.690 
of the Requiem is so timeless that I
don't<00:05:33.960> think<00:05:34.320> there's<00:05:34.500> any<00:05:34.650> need<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.610> the

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
don't think there's any need for the

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.350 
don't think there's any need for the
music<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.210> necessarily<00:05:36.840> be<00:05:37.170> absolutely<00:05:38.010> of

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
music to necessarily be absolutely of

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.190 
music to necessarily be absolutely of
any<00:05:39.360> one<00:05:39.750> particular<00:05:40.280> period<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.750> so<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.780> felt

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
any one particular period and so I felt

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.280 
any one particular period and so I felt
free<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.560> just<00:05:44.070> use<00:05:44.460> whatever<00:05:45.110> styles<00:05:46.110> and

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
free to just use whatever styles and

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.500 
free to just use whatever styles and
ideas<00:05:46.410> going<00:05:47.130> right<00:05:47.340> back<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.610> Gregorian

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
ideas going right back to Gregorian

chant of a thousand years ago and to
incorporate<00:05:52.380> them<00:05:52.920> into<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.490> statement<00:05:53.970> that

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
incorporate them into the statement that

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.880 
incorporate them into the statement that
I<00:05:54.150> wanted<00:05:54.510> to<00:05:54.690> make<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.170> I<00:05:55.470> think<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.740> other

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
I wanted to make and I think the other

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.220 
I wanted to make and I think the other
thing<00:05:56.190> is<00:05:56.340> that<00:05:56.370> although<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:57.630> might<00:05:57.870> say<00:05:58.170> if

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
thing is that although you might say if

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.600 
thing is that although you might say if
you<00:05:58.380> look<00:05:58.530> at<00:05:58.710> any<00:05:58.890> eight<00:05:59.610> bars<00:06:00.120> of<00:06:00.480> this<00:06:00.690> piece

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
you look at any eight bars of this piece

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.600 
you look at any eight bars of this piece
that<00:06:02.610> they<00:06:03.480> could<00:06:03.720> being<00:06:03.930> written<00:06:04.610> well

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
that they could being written well

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.950 
that they could being written well
perhaps<00:06:05.850> not<00:06:06.090> quite<00:06:06.240> a<00:06:06.330> hundred<00:06:06.690> years<00:06:06.870> ago

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
perhaps not quite a hundred years ago

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.340 
perhaps not quite a hundred years ago
but<00:06:07.320> certainly<00:06:07.770> some<00:06:08.010> while<00:06:08.280> ago<00:06:08.610> if<00:06:09.570> you<00:06:10.110> take

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
but certainly some while ago if you take

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.380 
but certainly some while ago if you take
it<00:06:10.500> as<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.650> whole<00:06:10.920> I<00:06:11.130> don't<00:06:11.220> think<00:06:11.850> it<00:06:12.120> could

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
it as a whole I don't think it could

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.150 
it as a whole I don't think it could
have<00:06:12.420> been<00:06:12.540> written<00:06:12.840> any<00:06:13.110> time<00:06:13.530> other<00:06:13.860> than

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
have been written any time other than

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.300 
have been written any time other than
the<00:06:15.000> 1980s<00:06:15.960> and<00:06:16.880> in<00:06:18.110> using<00:06:19.110> different<00:06:19.860> styles

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
the 1980s and in using different styles

the 1980s and in using different styles
and<00:06:20.490> ideas<00:06:20.610> I've<00:06:21.090> tried<00:06:21.390> to<00:06:21.690> pull<00:06:22.470> together

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
and ideas I've tried to pull together

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.490 
and ideas I've tried to pull together
and<00:06:23.700> it's<00:06:23.940> like<00:06:24.000> Marla<00:06:24.570> said<00:06:24.810> about<00:06:25.140> the
