00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.640
 Well now it 's time to check 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.090
 5 volts always 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.160
 remember that I must have 3 volts 3.3 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.270
 votes and 5 volts or louis 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.240
 at this moment I'm going to bail the peak 39 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.500
 pq 39 in the same way you will receive 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.420
 the 18 volts 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.140
 in the drains 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.390
 there is 18 volts remember that this 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.520
 voltage comes in the charger through 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.880
 of the switch that we already analyzed 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.220
 and in terminal 1 2 and 3 that corresponds 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.810
 to the suppliers 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.080
 I have 5 volts in this case 5.1 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.080
 volt 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.559
 If I did not have this voltage at the exit 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.430
 I would have to perform the terminal number 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.430
 4 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.960
 there I am in terminal 4 5.1 volts 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.000
 this voltage comes from max 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.760
 It should be noted that this circuit 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.280
 voltage and max controller 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.680
 also this being fed 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.270
 it must be powered with two voltages 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.750
 one of five and one of 18 volts in case 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.750
 having 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.200
 the connected charger if we have the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.130
 battery, we will logically have the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.729
 battery assembly 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:46.549
 in this circuit in particular the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:50.670
 terminal 17 corresponds to 5 and the 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:54.780
 terminal 20 corresponds to 18 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.430
 I'm going to review them, let's assume that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.920
 I have the two voltages always the voltage 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.990
 always is a permanent montage is something 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.930
 as well as a stand by as the voltages 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.110
 standby on other types of devices 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.910
 which are still present 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.819
 without the team being learned from 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.370
 done if you have realized not 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.410
 I have activated the payment switch 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.980
 checking the card simply with the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.490
 connected charger without giving the order of 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.580
 switched on 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.580
 well I will proceed to check the pin 17 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.700
 of my max this max has 14 terminals 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.700
 per side 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:53.590
 this would correspond to pin 15 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.690
 16 and 17 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.690
 and there I have the five bots 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.550
 in the max now I'm going to check the terminal 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.550
 twenty 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.590
 this is terminal 20 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.920
 and let's look 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.480
 that I also have 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.319
 and 18 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.319
 volts 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:38.019
 I just saw that the max is polarized 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:40.730
 correctly on pin 17 5 pin 20 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.790
 18 points 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.180
 and well then remember that the macs 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.670
 They have a protection of the soldier 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.579
 in this case it is a down could have been 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.340
 bp could have been 11 but could have 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.980
 been licensed to sense the names that 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.129
 are used for protections 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.890
 or bus payment in this case is being 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.550
 referring to 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.990
 terminal result number 6 follows the 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.150
 chip was 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.040
 inactive is to say that I do not have mounts 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.670
 at the exit of the monsters because the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.700
 maks is not polarizing them is not 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.830
 doing work now would be time to 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.900
 see that it is not protected in the max 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.540
 I'm going to check the number terminal 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.610
 6 in this case is the terminal number 6 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.689
 where 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.949
 receives the city voltage that is the 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.949
 Max protection 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:56.779
 and I see that it has 2 volts is varying 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:56.779
 2.4 2.3 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:05.350
 for this I would have to see in the 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.120
 diagram or on the parameters of the chip 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.490
 to see if the voltage that I am 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.160
 checking is the correct 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.160
 in this case yes it is correct since 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.160
 the position the team is working
