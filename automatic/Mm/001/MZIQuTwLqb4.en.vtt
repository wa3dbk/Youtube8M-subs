00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hey guys welcome back to the shop so I

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.079 
hey guys welcome back to the shop so I
was<00:00:03.330> given<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.600> piece<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.430> 10:45<00:00:05.430> today<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:05.819> was

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
was given a piece of 10:45 today I was

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.490 
was given a piece of 10:45 today I was
playing<00:00:06.180> card<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> end<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.790> I<00:00:09.349> decided<00:00:10.349> I

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
playing card on the end and I decided I

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.039 
playing card on the end and I decided I
paired<00:00:10.800> off<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.160> piece<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.690> don't<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.929> get

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
paired off this piece and so don't I get

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.959 
paired off this piece and so don't I get
to<00:00:13.080> looking<00:00:13.410> at<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.860> I'm<00:00:14.040> thinking<00:00:14.460> why

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
to looking at it and I'm thinking why

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.890 
to looking at it and I'm thinking why
would<00:00:15.150> Adam<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.510> course<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
would Adam do with it so of course I

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.170 
would Adam do with it so of course I
start<00:00:19.170> facing<00:00:19.500> off<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.580> front<00:00:20.820> end<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.060> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
start facing off to the front end of it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.150 
start facing off to the front end of it
and<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.930> guess<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.410> time<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.800> little<00:00:22.920> two

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and I guess it's time for a little two

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.640 
and I guess it's time for a little two
horsepower<00:00:23.460> leads<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.330> show<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.470> can

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
horsepower leads to show what they can

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.780 
horsepower leads to show what they can
do<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:30.170> like<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> other<00:00:31.320> guys<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
do so like the other guys I got the I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.410 
do so like the other guys I got the I
get<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> chuck<00:00:33.840> mark<00:00:34.170> feeds<00:00:35.070> engaged<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.969> set

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
get to chuck mark feeds engaged and set

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
get to chuck mark feeds engaged and set
on<00:00:36.570> zero<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.380> don't<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.770> you're<00:00:37.890> gonna<00:00:38.100> be

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
on zero I don't know if you're gonna be

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
on zero I don't know if you're gonna be
able<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> numbers<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.570> not<00:00:40.430> which

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
able to see the numbers or not which

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.270 
able to see the numbers or not which
right<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> couple<00:00:41.820> different<00:00:42.270> angles<00:00:42.570> here

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
right a couple different angles here

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.880 
right a couple different angles here
that's<00:00:44.280> better<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> we'll<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.469> revolution

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that's better so we'll do one revolution

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:59.110 
that's better so we'll do one revolution
of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.610> truck<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.910> brings<00:00:57.210> us<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
of the truck and that brings us up to

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.579 
of the truck and that brings us up to
well<00:01:00.120> we're<00:01:00.390> looking<00:01:00.480> about<00:01:01.010> 27<00:01:03.589> those

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
well we're looking about 27 those

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
well we're looking about 27 those
closest<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> 30<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> with

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
closest I can get to 30 with the with

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
me to 76 RPM closes I had is 300 so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.080 
me to 76 RPM closes I had is 300 so
we'll<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.610> option<00:01:36.000> was

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
we'll go with that the other option was

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.340 
we'll go with that the other option was
190<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.470> we'll<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.740> into<00:01:37.890> 300<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.140> we'll<00:01:40.140> see

to a bit is b-series we got a hand

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.420 
to a bit is b-series we got a hand
ground<00:02:44.600> chipbreaker<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.470> there<00:02:45.680> let's<00:02:46.190> see<00:02:46.370> if

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
ground chipbreaker in there let's see if

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.110 
ground chipbreaker in there let's see if
we<00:02:46.550> can<00:02:46.640> get<00:02:46.760> focus<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.990> just<00:02:49.120> raise

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
we can get focus on that and just raise

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:04.640 
we can get focus on that and just raise
crap<00:02:50.450> right<00:02:50.690> knowing<00:02:51.110> searcher

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650

yeah I think I'll quit while I'm ahead
at<00:04:41.150> sixty<00:04:41.629> thousand<00:04:42.099> it's<00:04:43.099> not<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.280> big<00:04:43.520> Navy

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
at sixty thousand it's not a big Navy

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.040 
at sixty thousand it's not a big Navy
that<00:04:43.969> I<00:04:44.030> mean<00:04:44.180> it's<00:04:44.330> got<00:04:44.539> a<00:04:44.569> two<00:04:44.750> horsepower

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
that I mean it's got a two horsepower

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.550 
that I mean it's got a two horsepower
electric<00:04:45.319> motor<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.870> don't<00:04:48.080> expect<00:04:48.349> too

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
electric motor so you don't expect too

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.189 
electric motor so you don't expect too
much<00:04:48.770> from<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:49.099> so<00:04:50.090> that's<00:04:50.389> not<00:04:50.629> too<00:04:50.810> bad<00:04:51.020> at

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
much from it so that's not too bad at
