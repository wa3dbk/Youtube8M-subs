00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.220
 no no 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.460
 and here 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.899
 In the heart of the Andes, a 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.320
 treasure for feeding all the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.750
 humanity 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.450
 ah 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.700
 Quinoa known by the Incas as the 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.830
 mother of all the beans is the only 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.700
 plant element that contains all the 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.700
 essential amino acids 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.449
 2013 has been designated by the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 united nations as the year 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.579
 International Quinoa 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.579
 ah 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.040
 the wealth of the machine is not only in 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 the grains of their colorful bread leaves their 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.470
 value is above all knowledge 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 accumulated by the Andean peoples what 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.420
 has allowed to preserve its diverse 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 varieties improve their performance and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.410
 develop a gastronomy of the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.720
 quinoa 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.259
 that is the true wealth that we 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.350
 offers a future sown thousands of years ago 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350
 years 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.159
 the biodiversity of quinoa 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 It becomes a powerful tool 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.170
 to fight hunger and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.990
 adaptation to climate change 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.509
 the quinoa has a very good attention to 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.930
 several types of soil because it resists 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.810
 cold can resist the height but 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.340
 also because the quinoa has a 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.340
 adaptation to poor soils 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.190
 there are thousands of small producers 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.990
 family members who will be benefited 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.540
 thanks to the international year of the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.170
 quinoa which will stimulate production 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.709
 and the consumption of this grain 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.770
 we do not deal in products 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:20.380
 chemical or chemical fertilizers then 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.380
 Quinoa is produced completely natural 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.530
 the international year will also encourage 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.160
 scientific research on this 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.750
 so cultivate its nutritional virtues 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.440
 will be part of the diet and trade 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.080
 world 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 with cultural culinary events 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.750
 politicians and academics the year 2013 will be 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.500
 a great celebration of this treasure of 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.500
 the native peoples 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.430
 a true gift from the Andes' for 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.859
 the world 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.859
 a future sown thousands of years ago
