00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 she asks if he said I hope 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.960
 you are well we meet for the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.630
 news of the week there from a grid that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.830
 like debt came out on Thursday night so 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 with a little bit of delay I you 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.430
 give the latest news about 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 signs is what will happen in the 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.730
 weeks ahead so we start everything 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.489
 first is a small assessment of the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.199
 first week post dlcs 2 in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.699
 which porridge we simply 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.379
 give some info about the 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.720
 first wave that was played on the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.640
 tournament two so we see here the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.290
 main spots and main axes 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 of passage of the players so it's good 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.040
 that we can see that most of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.930
 time it was the axes borrowed time 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.210
 for snipers only for research 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 so we can see the stocks here 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.420
 snipers so we took the meadows well 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610
 aloud that evil what they did to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.019
 delicacies of the first week 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.210
 recognize and know and in the 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.400
 second map and and release we want 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 simply the courses that were 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.820
 made by the players most of the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.500
 time on this tablecloth gueye so 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 it's nice enough to take 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.799
 knowledge of all this and it's true 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.119
 that this confirms a little bit the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.460
 first impressions we had 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 about this tournament the osiris is 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.969
 simply the attendance that we 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.840
 the prefers of the first map of the 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.700
 first week 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.890
 so we always continue regarding this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.259
 for me it appeared that some 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.420
 people have found a way pretty 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.609
 impressive for apparently cheating 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.799
 there were invincible players so 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.259
 bengui will seriously look at the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.060
 question to come these cheats and that 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.429
 This is rather good news 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.049
 a madman next it's about the way 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.759
 to do that so will be back the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.170
 Tuesday 2nd June 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.490
 all this lady look to do it 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.859
 know that there have been some small 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.749
 novelties that have been made and who 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.340
 are already developed on the 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:55.740
 waiters just waiting to be 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 triggered next Tuesday since these 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.569
 novelties that we were in range with the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.340
 patch 1.2.0 points reached so in this 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.950
 about how to do everything 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.500
 first concerning the items we will have the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.509
 next week copies 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.910
 boots a fusion rifle and a 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.770
 scout physics then regarding 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.730
 the changes of which there are some 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.190
 little novelties 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.650
 first of all light and eric will be 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.910
 available for purchase from rank 3 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.890
 and lasts 25 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.200
 we do not know, however, whether his purchase 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.580
 will be limited to a certain amount in 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.050
 anyway what is certain is that if this 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 is not the case how to do 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.820
 becomes very very interesting 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.160
 the drop in the cost of items has been 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.709
 also announced by cons we do not have 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.480
 info on the price that will be displayed bed 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.500
 on their wings armor that is 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.600
 show available 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 I hope in any case that it will be the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.190
 last level because the level 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.739
 works there will be an xp boost for 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.290
 your character with the weakest 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.330
 reputation of the three on your account 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.239
 so basically the weakest of your 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.310
 characters will have an xp boost 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.590
 until you get the level of your 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.330
 highest character so always 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.400
 for one and the same account 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.590
 they will also still and always 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.180
 work the rebalancing of the staffs 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.070
 and tears so remember to 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.590
 take with you your best 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.150
 equipment and finally to finish three 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.930
 maps will be added to the new 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.330
 orientation 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.459
 it is therefore the cauldron of the planted o 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.230
 and of an excluded the exact blues on 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.090
 playstation to continue with the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.920
 info about the next patch to 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.530
 to come we have no date for the moment 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.090
 we just know that bungie is focused 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.130
 about the different error codes and 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.530
 other connections that we can 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.630
 meet since the release of the dlc 2 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.400
 also comes the problem of the emblem 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.350
 exotic wicker risks some 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.030
 players do not magnify for cause 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.410
 full inventory and it's the same 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.720
 for the different coatings and 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.310
 vessels that should be doubting and one 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.980
 it is apparently not so 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.630
 bungie will focus on all that 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.459
 is also announced that the look of the 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.410

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.269
 increased and that the bug 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.300
 b ammunition synthesis piling up 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.550
