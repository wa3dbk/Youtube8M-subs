00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.669
 staged 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.640

 that on it that they change a piece when 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.509
 and then it should install that 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.249
 not scoreless 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.919
 it is a strange one 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.189
 for the iPod and the iPhone 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.189

 the incoming post quotes August 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.749
 Actually, this app is going on in the store 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:36.739
 have it

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.289
 Customers want 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.289
 now you can see that she is me again 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.029
 formal description of some of the trace radiation and this obsolete 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.260
 but if 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.080
 usually there is talk

 GEC woke up version of this game offering Oman's can download 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.039

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.590
 from almost every app 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.590
 is there a departure on the PSI inControl g 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:47.870
 but it is pretty 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.330
 the slow and the side and 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.960
 must enter a captcha 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.080
 a little stupid 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.499
 what 17 cannes come media source com 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.870
 by partly already with 1 2 5mw loaded the dossier maxims until then 16 

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:03.680
 Thousands of DSL have 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.740
 So you have Ohnemus game 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.719
 Some even play early 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.159
 At some point, Primacom will need to enter Screen Capture 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.580

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.569
 Son and you click on criticism of the top download 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.360
 wait at the moment 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.849
 and then you see already here drum Parish Clemens Prokop 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.159
 you type here on the Taunus and then you see this rudder wants to stay 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:29.939
 Zone 30 kilos of gold 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.009
 the second 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.110

 Chinatown Wars 585 in the car 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.189
 not even taken so long until I mean 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.889
 with 20 minutes 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.240
 and lock also impeccable and all that I have created so far 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.240
 Brawn we ask and there is already finished but still complicated 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.960
 then Kidman here 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.689
 Prof sparkling 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.009
 in Steyr 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.069
 one moment 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.360
 the pretty fast 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.550
 but after three seconds to play also already installed 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.550
 you go back to his home screen 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.229
 Waiting a moment too late is displayed 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.710
 then pack a bit now 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.990
 and is on it 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.689
 Guttenberg you see 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.369
 at 0 50 street 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:33.389
 does not do it that way 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.969
 quite the range between seems 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.439
 always it works 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.960
 that went fast I mean how long that took until the baptismal water is good 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.520
 cute many endgame 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.680
 but percent 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.029
 you see, it works 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.309
 you can almost nothing at all but no matter 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.110
 to the typical stress goes 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.110
 almost as fast from the App Store and costs a penny 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.800
 the company has previously opportunity 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.899
 ax4 to test or you just do not feel like it is 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:04.230
 pay the first 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.039
 which does not recognize such small programs 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.860
 Pay back money or just before the end of the test with some felt 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.860
 20 know dollars 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.270
 Dietersheim holds the 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.699
 even shortly before just under loading to test them 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.550
 because he practically like me, I take advantage of that is not quite through 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.490
 perhaps 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.490
 Property of all EPS have 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.760
 that I like 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.339
 Visit constantly I find I really think 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.349
 Neuenkirchen speak 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.889
 and around 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.050
 yes I hope you can excuse me 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.039
 I hope you just as much prefer more 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:46.039
 no mistakes 

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.999
 I will probably have more videos in the future 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:52.779
 also about other Schellberg 

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:54.599
 Functions themselves 

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.599
 from the iPod Touch or the one front 

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.009
 Percent of the ashes take place before 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:04.449
 my presentation, so to speak 

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:08.219
 and the buyers again, you may get something in the future 

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:10.319
 there completely 

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.179
 but then I wish a lot of fun 

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:15.369
 on the iPod iPhone 

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:16.639
 Gates belong to each other
