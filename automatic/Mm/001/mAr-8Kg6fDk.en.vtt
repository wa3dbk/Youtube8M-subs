00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.420
 how do you deal with babies born prematurely and especially to the brothers and 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.450
 the 60-year-old helmet that is the subject of the book and film, I want to remember that madlener 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.230
 Hamersveld's difference is that madlener tears want your work and remember one 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.310
 very nice book for the brothers and sisters of a very small baby of one 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.900
 One month old man himself has been married for fifteen years and therein became one 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.869
 traffic accident in slums for years it seemed tired 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.529
 but t is not making a fair play award two 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.270
 I have a lot of display satisfaction for your work yes you get through anyway 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.109
 be a good connection with her time 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.479
 if you see those children evaluating henk international to pass you by 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.340
 that a child of his go home more than twice 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.080
 yes it is grateful to be on the side 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.800
 and colors to year to 15 year olds to offer 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.859
 the coincidence 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.560
 at the point of premature babies, such signs become 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.970
 yes also not fair 7 percent 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.500
 25 percent are premature births and men speak of premature births 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.080
 if there is a pregnancy no more than 37 weeks at least three weeks 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.619
 deficit yes then you can you can wash through a bit of the pre-cured year 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.100
 time I have three children myself 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.360
 yes including a 14 year old and in a competitive late 36 weeks 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.000
 clearly 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.780
 martin gig but again that they actually do 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.860
 well done by flu i can 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.730
 not really saying he let you have some more directing though 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.670
 karaoke set has a night out 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.250
 to be the first 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.790
 but it is more so because of my experience that I still felt like a book like that 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.210
 there is something to write about anp the fed works the can almost on one in the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.340
 ten babies from media group borussia free via is estimated 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.740
 what happens then finally what are the risks in the most important risks 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.610
 of such a baby as if it is born prematurely and yes it is an objective 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.090
 the woman's willingness of the organs 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.420
 he is age 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.620
 the dish is from now on the children here 32 weeks in addition 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.680
 Pregnancy to be born A pretty good program has leaked 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.950
 to endure everything a lot every 32 weeks 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.520
 there is always something more risk of complications that there are also fewer 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.749
 being rich 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:16.799
 For a few years, 4 out of 24 weeks are already saying that the limit should be achievable 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:17.539
 that then 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.419
 also pop 24 weeks the latter only begin to develop 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.519
 and you need one for being able to breathe for the gazet 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.859
 Changing between under 24 weeks is really hard for that 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.829
 save children yes 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.219
 and manager is then born prematurely what then happens to with 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.659
 ten people because the paepe people are left with a lot of questions amsterdam one 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.149
 years not because 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:45.129
 the plant of your wage published childbirths that is often a sponge one 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.709
 complication that 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.560
 For example, to break the French-speaking button will get that one 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.979
 urgent caesarean section 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.709
 indeed it is quite a stressful moment with a lot of uncertainty too 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.369
 to have 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:02.529
 they ask local doctors for years how they treat our child and then it will let go 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.029
 but 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.819
 for children aged six that is also difficult to predict at present 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.649
 no so yes they have to be very patient about the whole process from yes 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.769
 if you were born prematurely, they could not continue 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.879
 you can also find eric after a certain period 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.559
 it will basically not sit in the fences as if that were the club's goal too 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.329
 the name nine months do not play football so they still remain with that 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.790
 uncertainty know no that uncertainty coming out of welberg after being two years 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.209
 with of course if the children go to school and if there is nevertheless a profit 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.169
 yes there are problems or language delay 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.719
 but they do a lot of researching which of the brains to look at and if 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.180
 a child's example has not had an oxygen deficiency and has no brain hemorrhage 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:47.079
 If that was the case she could just be well done because malia involved seafish 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.400
 officer nokia very nice it very nice freddy the book tells the brothers some 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:53.839
 and serge of very small baby died anp 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.479
 but apparently also high because you started from the idea of ​​one of ing 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.950
 tip 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.729
 yes yes look a little year yes 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.220
 looking at your freddy closes the financial year 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.340
 it is derived the two in the first part is for the little ones three years 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.209
 because the church easily image of gv actually to the children of one 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.219
 chick that the counter comes before katwijk 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:20.370
 because many children had that image field yes that would be a small kitchen than the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.040
 men returns I have just to see while crawling with knives 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.250
 And the extra care needed to make a plan with more that no that 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.039
 Then NPM is that the customer can happen 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.720
 be born prematurely 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.169
 the brothers and sisters 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.580
 then with a lot of free need what happens then finally and they will never have the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.640
 really focus on those inside and have in the front 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.680
 other brothers and sisters that you are not without his marks that year 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.680
 it is difficult for parents to explain exactly 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.830
 the easier it is to get what's going on 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.520
 emmen 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.759
 bathing child a child who is given a drip in the incubator 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.979
 it's not that simple because the forts 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.139
 actually and that was the purpose of my book on the one hand and a little 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.729
 more accessible 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.030
 and then there is of course also very much to hear between the church and the whole 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:09.069
 process because 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.309
 too often attention 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:13.259
 both climate hours 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:14.469
 and 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:16.259
 while the brothers and sisters 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.889
 those are also an important title in the part of the family and I have 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.610
 try some tips 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.029
 and also in parts 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.189
 important role actually in the whole process that is a tutsi yet 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:28.230
 not from the parents 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.550
 how to deal with that to yourself and others james a whole chapter 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.500
 passed away 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.680
 he is called that then 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.900
 and there is an explanation of what they can do and also 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.020
 they are just as important as breathing 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.729
 make a train actually all the things that the baby needs to 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.110
 good to develop well a bit of a temporary departure from a 4 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.139
 and I am a separate four-leaf clover, and then bit of warmth ruled 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.250
 actually started in fourth place and the action was my home country by itself 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.849
 janus a6 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.490
 actually it's the caring 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.340
 and also the children who need it a little bit of attention 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.460
 skin contact the island not only new leader halfway usd 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.229
 it is the total package that is important for a good one 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.770
 Developing a baby had the interest of that family actually in Japan 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.520
 can also let them have an air attack in development through communication 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.280
 Of those things I'm going to be a book the trend can be translated throughout 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.550
 many different languages 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.319
