00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
prepare rose first of all a base okay so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.760 
prepare rose first of all a base okay so
I<00:01:20.759> give<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.690> up<00:01:21.780> Foreman<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:23.250> over<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:23.940> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.120 

let's<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.670> shape<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.150> cone

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.730 

this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> base<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.259> will<00:01:37.530> show<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this is the base then I will show you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.560 
this is the base then I will show you
now<00:01:37.979> how<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> pattern<00:01:39.409> those<00:01:40.409> red

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.900 

took<00:01:44.140> our<00:01:44.320> ball<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.830> fondant<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.640> keep

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
took our ball of fondant and this keep

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.530 
took our ball of fondant and this keep
on

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
on

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.140 
on
listen<00:01:51.170> you'd<00:01:51.290> like<00:01:51.470> this

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.039 

perfect

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
perfect

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
perfect
you're<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:01.710> comfortable<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.729> can

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you're not comfortable like that you can

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.809 
you're not comfortable like that you can
do<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
do it with this also and see the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.260 
do it with this also and see the
thickness<00:02:09.319> thickness<00:02:10.319> should<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:11.030> hard<00:02:12.030> very

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
thickness thickness should be hard very

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
thickness thickness should be hard very
thin<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.290> thick<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:15.270> be<00:02:16.430> precise<00:02:17.430> in

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
thin not very thick to be precise in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.900 
thin not very thick to be precise in
which<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.209> are<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.630> handle<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.110> properly

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
which you are you can handle it properly

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.240 
which you are you can handle it properly
so<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.600> how<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.780> prepare<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.290> petal<00:02:22.770> rose

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so this is how we prepare a petal rose

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.330 
so this is how we prepare a petal rose
petal

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
petal

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.130 
petal
don't<00:02:26.340> worry<00:02:26.520> about<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.000> base<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.720> bother

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
don't worry about the base just bother

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.390 
don't worry about the base just bother
about<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:29.040> top<00:02:29.250> most<00:02:29.700> part<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.660> part

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
about the top most part in this part

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.860 
about the top most part in this part
this<00:02:32.400> should<00:02:32.580> be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
this should be

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.960 
this should be
I<00:02:34.230> mean<00:02:35.160> she

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.350 

like<00:02:38.210> this

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.550 

I<00:02:42.390> fired<00:02:43.610> preparator<00:02:44.640> impotence<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.840> now

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
I fired preparator impotence so now

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.530 
I fired preparator impotence so now
let's<00:02:46.800> see<00:02:47.010> how<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> assemble<00:02:48.620> pose

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.190 

the<00:02:54.379> forbade<00:02:54.920> my<00:02:55.159> face

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.620 

since<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.650> police<00:03:02.800> they<00:03:03.069> have

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
since the police they have

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.160 
since the police they have
the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.960 
the
but<00:03:06.740> there<00:03:06.920> will<00:03:07.069> be<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.280> little<00:03:07.550> bit<00:03:07.640> smaller

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
but there will be a little bit smaller

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.559 
but there will be a little bit smaller
one<00:03:09.130> he<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.520> smaller<00:03:10.959> because<00:03:12.790> okay<00:03:13.790> you

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
one he is it smaller because okay you

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:24.530 
one he is it smaller because okay you
need<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.840> roll<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.110> like<00:03:15.500> this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.330 

first<00:03:25.170> petal<00:03:25.409> would<00:03:25.709> be<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.069> way<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.870> made

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
first petal would be in this way I made

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.589 
first petal would be in this way I made
kind<00:03:29.340> of

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.240 

kind<00:03:33.140> of<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.379> poor<00:03:33.590> pocket<00:03:34.040> wristlet<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
kind of a poor pocket wristlet and the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.100 
kind of a poor pocket wristlet and the
next<00:03:37.549> better<00:03:37.819> would<00:03:38.090> be<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.299> little<00:03:38.329> bit<00:03:38.750> more

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
next better would be a little bit more
