out<00:02:36.050> don't<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.710> think<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:36.950> used<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.250> once<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.790> test

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
out don't I think I used it once to test

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.760 
out don't I think I used it once to test
it<00:02:38.120> out<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.360> never<00:02:38.540> use<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.720> again<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.590> you've

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
it out I never use it again and you've

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.620 
it out I never use it again and you've
got<00:02:39.860> facetime<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.340> your<00:02:40.610> phones<00:02:40.820> now<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.330> think

the<00:02:43.730> next<00:02:43.910> step<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.180> think<00:02:44.360> we<00:02:44.450> definitely<00:02:44.570> will

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
the next step I think we definitely will

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.230 
the next step I think we definitely will
be<00:02:45.080> seeing<00:02:45.370> front-facing<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.700> back<00:02:46.880> facing

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
be seeing front-facing and a back facing

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.870 
be seeing front-facing and a back facing
camera<00:02:47.540> high<00:02:48.020> resolution<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.830> like<00:02:49.070> HD<00:02:49.460> movies

camera high resolution to like HD movies

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.250 
camera high resolution to like HD movies
even<00:02:50.120> though<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.420> would<00:02:50.570> be<00:02:50.660> like<00:02:50.690> well<00:02:51.140> let

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
even though this would be like well let

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.870 
even though this would be like well let

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
thing I want which is definitely be

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.620 
thing I want which is definitely be
definitely<00:03:09.080> doable<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.760> port<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.480> side

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
definitely doable is a port on the side

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.300 
definitely doable is a port on the side
right<00:03:11.870> here<00:03:12.050> 30<00:03:12.410> pin<00:03:12.590> connector<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
right here 30 pin connector so that I

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.030 
right here 30 pin connector so that I
can<00:03:13.370> dock<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.880> in<00:03:14.330> landscape<00:03:14.660> mode<00:03:15.040> therefore

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
can dock it in landscape mode therefore

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.740 
can dock it in landscape mode therefore
that<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.459> type<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.940> apple<00:03:17.209> keyboard<00:03:17.360> in

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
that I can type on the apple keyboard in

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.870 
that I can type on the apple keyboard in
landscape<00:03:18.020> mode<00:03:18.400> because<00:03:19.400> right<00:03:19.700> now<00:03:19.730> you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
landscape mode because right now you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.520 
landscape mode because right now you
have<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.300> take<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.570> portrait<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.170> everything

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
have to take the portrait and everything

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.470 
have to take the portrait and everything
looks<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:21.800> much<00:03:21.890> nicer<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.489> landscape<00:03:23.300> like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
looks so much nicer in landscape like

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.090 
looks so much nicer in landscape like
I'm<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.959> mail<00:03:24.170> app<00:03:24.410> you've<00:03:24.620> got<00:03:24.830> all<00:03:24.950> the

guys<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.540> email<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:29.989> think<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.670> 30-pin

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
guys the email so I think a 30-pin

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.640 
guys the email so I think a 30-pin
connector<00:03:31.730> on<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.150> side<00:03:32.390> would<00:03:33.050> be<00:03:33.080> very<00:03:33.500> very

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
connector on the side would be very very

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.380 
connector on the side would be very very
handy<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.610> only<00:03:34.760> problem<00:03:34.970> with<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.360> that

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
handy the only problem with that is that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.050 
handy the only problem with that is that
now<00:03:35.690> you've<00:03:35.870> got<00:03:36.080> cases<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:37.520> have<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.880> have

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
now you've got cases that have to have

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.420 
now you've got cases that have to have
holes<00:03:38.720> all<00:03:39.110> over<00:03:39.170> them<00:03:39.530> for<00:03:39.770> like<00:03:39.890> SD<00:03:40.070> card

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
holes all over them for like SD card

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.240 
holes all over them for like SD card
slots<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.440> but<00:03:42.440> i<00:03:42.530> don't<00:03:42.650> know<00:03:42.769> i<00:03:42.830> think<00:03:42.890> we

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
slots and but i don't know i think we

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.470 
slots and but i don't know i think we
really<00:03:43.550> really<00:03:43.760> need<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:44.030> add<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.150> little<00:03:44.360> bit

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
really really need to add a little bit

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.780 
really really need to add a little bit
more<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:45.410> know<00:03:45.440> functionality<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.700> I

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
more you know functionality to the I

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.190 
more you know functionality to the I
