tree<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.769> while<00:02:32.950> back<00:02:33.159> because<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.430> had<00:02:33.579> dandruff

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.440 
I don't have dandruff anymore I think
that's<00:02:36.069> because<00:02:36.189> my<00:02:36.579> scalp<00:02:36.879> is<00:02:37.060> allowed<00:02:37.420> to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
that's because my scalp is allowed to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.910 
that's because my scalp is allowed to
breathe<00:02:37.810> thanks<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.170> style<00:02:38.379> my<00:02:38.530> hair<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.769> lot

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
though

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.550 
though
mostly<00:03:28.419> because<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.810> can't<00:03:29.079> that<00:03:29.290> would<00:03:29.379> take<00:03:29.530> a

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
mostly because I can't that would take a

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.890 
mostly because I can't that would take a
crapload<00:03:29.799> of<00:03:29.979> soap<00:03:30.220> but<00:03:30.879> I'm<00:03:31.030> also<00:03:31.299> because<00:03:31.720> I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
crapload of soap but I'm also because I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.659 
crapload of soap but I'm also because I
just<00:03:32.049> don't<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:32.859> doesn't<00:03:33.129> take<00:03:33.220> all<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.370> so

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
just don't it doesn't take all that so

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.699 
just don't it doesn't take all that so
you<00:03:34.269> know<00:03:34.389> I<00:03:34.419> just<00:03:34.509> kind<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.959> rub<00:03:35.169> it<00:03:35.199> in<00:03:35.409> making

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
you know I just kind of rub it in making

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.429 
you know I just kind of rub it in making
sure<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.099> there's<00:03:36.430> no<00:03:36.519> like<00:03:37.079> solid<00:03:38.079> chunks

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
sure that there's no like solid chunks

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.020 
sure that there's no like solid chunks
in<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.069> then<00:03:39.519> I'll<00:03:39.609> rinse<00:03:39.759> it<00:03:39.909> out

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
in there and then I'll rinse it out

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.710 
in there and then I'll rinse it out
really<00:03:40.329> really<00:03:40.479> well<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.389> don't<00:03:43.569> like

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
really really well so that I don't like

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.539 
really really well so that I don't like
sounding<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.169> very<00:03:44.319> often<00:03:44.620> Chlo<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:45.129> don't<00:03:45.370> care

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
sounding it very often Chlo I don't care

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.899 
sounding it very often Chlo I don't care
to<00:03:45.639> use<00:03:45.759> the<00:03:45.849> soap<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.329> much<00:03:47.250> I've<00:03:48.250> used<00:03:48.549> baking

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
to use the soap so much I've used baking

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.059 
to use the soap so much I've used baking
soda<00:03:49.120> by<00:03:49.269> itself<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:49.900> I've<00:03:50.019> used<00:03:50.229> apple<00:03:50.949> cider

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
soda by itself and I've used apple cider

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.119 
soda by itself and I've used apple cider
vinegar<00:03:51.189> by<00:03:51.579> itself

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
vinegar by itself

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.649 
vinegar by itself
I<00:03:54.129> haven't<00:03:54.699> do<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.909> recently<00:03:55.239> though<00:03:55.419> I

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
I haven't do that recently though I

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.199 
I haven't do that recently though I
don't<00:03:55.840> know<00:03:55.900> why<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:57.609> that's<00:03:57.729> pretty<00:03:57.849> much<00:03:58.000> it

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
don't know why so that's pretty much it

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.179 
don't know why so that's pretty much it
I<00:03:58.329> don't<00:03:58.479> wrap<00:03:58.629> my<00:03:58.780> hair<00:03:59.019> up<00:03:59.109> at<00:03:59.259> night<00:03:59.439> the<00:04:00.069> way

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
I don't wrap my hair up at night the way

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.289 
I don't wrap my hair up at night the way
I<00:04:00.220> used<00:04:00.609> to<00:04:01.379> probably<00:04:02.379> because<00:04:02.919> it<00:04:03.909> kind<00:04:04.239> of

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
I used to probably because it kind of

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.210 
I used to probably because it kind of
falls<00:04:04.689> a<00:04:04.840> little<00:04:05.049> bit<00:04:05.169> better<00:04:05.319> now<00:04:05.439> when<00:04:05.949> I<00:04:06.040> say

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
falls a little bit better now when I say

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.749 
falls a little bit better now when I say
fall<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.489> mean<00:04:06.759> this<00:04:06.939> is<00:04:07.359> how<00:04:07.509> it<00:04:07.569> falls<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.609> if<00:04:09.609> I

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:09.759 
fall I mean this is how it falls so if I

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.189
