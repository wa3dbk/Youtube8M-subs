00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 Hello, we continue all the lessons 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.450
 creating site promotion 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.280
 I hope you and seeing the previous lesson 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.670
 set a goal to write what 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.250
 materials in the coming months and already 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.870
 move towards this goal determined 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
 the steps of someone moving small 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.320
 steps when moving in large steps 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 long strides but the main thing is to move and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.240
 if you move the goal the goal is nowhere to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.090
 you are not going anywhere and will not run away, let us 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.579
 assume that as a priori content is on 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.430
 the first plan you fill the site 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.219
 regularly and so on and now what 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 regards further action now you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.280
 need to get a few dozen 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.379
 would blades to your site would blades it 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.789
 backlinks then there is some site 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.980
 refers to your site now systems what 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.930
 google yandex enter various filters 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.649
 various innovations 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.660
 there is a dispute from either useful blades 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.930
 for the site but first for the content 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.750
 they are definitely useful for now 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.310
 for a commercial site there is already controversial 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.710
 the question is but so we make the site 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.700
 non-commercial and the content is not our 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.439
 The exercise is the links we need and where 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.970
 same get first links 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.950
 the very first links that were 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.100
 receive we will receive home 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 page with profiles of sites that is, we 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.759
 we will drive our site through the database 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.070
 site profiles it will give us how to increase 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.710
 Used trainings as he said to anyone 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.950
 tic growth will also be observed 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.229
 positions for certain requests afterwards 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.200
 further we will buy with you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.979
 links in various services 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.380
 automatically for procuring cube 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.170
 some services but it will be further 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.659
 and now we are going to get first 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.610
 quality links for our site like 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.979
 can get in can accordingly 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 download this trust site database 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.189
 hand off in hands manually from this 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.710
 the effect will be the effect will be but it will be 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.180
 minimum principle 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.950
 use the fit service 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.569
 site 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.190
 waiter dot ru i am all my resources 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.200
 chased on this site that is, the database 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.690
 this site on the site employees 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.000
 chased away for money prices naturally 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.480
 I would say that guts are more expensive 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.849
 minimum for this kind of services 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.010
 let me show you what tariff to choose as 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.660
 we see there are a lot of tariffs more precisely 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.980
 a little 4 tariffs more precisely 4 options 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.379
 submitting registration services to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.620
 article directory forums 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:43.310
 links will make the site on the engine and head 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.900
 links in the profile of sites well, I recommend 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.739
 you use links from profiles 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.510
 sites 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.590
 let's see more about this 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.709
 You can read the service that will give you 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.910
 run now as for package order 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.420
 you can choose the most minimal 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.519
 package which time a delicacy 50 reverse 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.940
 links sleep to frame for $ 30 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.190
 about 900 rubles is not so much 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.170
 the big price though now should be 7 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.269
 rubles a cube there he is roughly thousands 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.720
 rubles I think they are so much money 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.060
 and save them in standing by any man 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.139
 which starts making websites just 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.170
 tick the next step 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.340
 in the work on the site you will be getting 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.790
 first backlinks 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.250
 here's a package delicacy project for 30 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.139
 dollars is not so much as I have already 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.109
 said above but the effect will be 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.420
 noticeable and your site will get the first links 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.549
 and will already grow for some 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.889
 certain requests dough not all 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.910
 requests but for some we come to requests 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:50.630
 He will definitely grow in the top on this all 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.750

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.810
 links to which we will buy links 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.739
 to the site but this is again after about how 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.169

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.940
