00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.110
 All this 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.819
 so here we are again the payment this start today we present to the island 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.900
 but good, we were already starting 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.020
 I have not said yet that you're a nasty asshole asshole 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 scoundrels 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.580
 he fought to save him 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.240
 fuck if you can not do anything like that 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.770
 good look to celebrate that today is to know if people are going to let this 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500
 month a new section 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.590
 my age all like trying to bribe me 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.930
 look fuck yourself now 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.300
 you know that an embroidery or prison killer has escaped 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.720
 I do not care 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.810
 we looked at the first fight that was between the esmirriado and nescafé kingston 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.820
 for the inter secondary title 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.200
 as he knew and we all knew that the fight was going to be a fucking shit he did 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.450
 to enter the nexus to burst a bit and then give a speech that 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.640
 It was the most entertaining of combat 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.159
 I believe that by saying that the esmirriado retained is enough 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.750
 Well, the next fight was between the fat man and the society of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.520
 doctors against cancer 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.680
 this combat was half that and in the end the fat man landed with two 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.510
 centimeters panic went with his carcinogenic girlfriend leaving the other two 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.200
 sick with him 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.480
 that reminds me that he has escaped 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.070
 remember 4 5 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.690
 that you already told me ostia italia 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.760
 good come, go to the next fight 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.360
 it's what I'm going to do 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.530
 it turns out that after this combat there was a speech of the miserable saying 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.010
 who joined the team of the wwf and then started the fight that was 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.020
 between said or we continue against the rapist of legends' by 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.689
 the title of the wwww www 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.469
 the combat was normalized 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.549
 nothing strange happened until the fact his took a chair and tried to hit the 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.590
 rapist and so he was disqualified and retained the title 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.810
 but it is also that the referee trying to get rid of it ended up rolling 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.989
 like a concrete vulgar 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.179
 power hahaha ndombe party or anything with that 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.519
 well you know that a murderous ordeal has escaped from prison 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:34.659
 can do is a child of 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.509
 fucking son of a bitch 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.759
 'calde' the day you repeat macias torito 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.759
 good and now what the fuck is wrong with the music 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.499
 but good this is 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.290
 now 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.290
 the deleted coord 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.609
 but that has been that host 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.249
 he was the indian choreographer sandip 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.689
 well better we do not forget or that we are going to try 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.249
 come on let's go to the next fight that was between the crazy monster but Spanish 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.789
 bartolo against the mariguana dwarf for the title of falete pesos 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.659
 but what the hell is wrong with you 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.919
 busti i'm telling you marijuana 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.899
 back again you will grow more powerful than this shit of results 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.689
 to see with it that is a nickname and everyone has nicknames 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.669
 but that restart period of adding up equals is the best fighter of all 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.829
 the times and the stories 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.359
 come and if you are happy, you will be better for you 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.419
 Well the next fight is what I just said 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.319
 the fight won it as he knew and we all knew the non-cobalt monster 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.919
 and then as I knew and we all knew also appeared don hurraco vultures 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.599
 scavengers 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.139
 more well-known as the gravedigger 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.680
 Well, this was already what I had to see 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.340
 come back with a while to beat him with a bartolo and the one that ends 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.020
 taking the beating is him 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.590
 Well, it seems a bit strange to me 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.500
 already me but clean is like that 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500
 surely he would smoke something else without losing 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.690
 We already mentioned the last fight against the star event that we all expected but that 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.380
 as always our friend vincent code in a way that can already happen 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.449
 to the history 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.849
 the match itself was of the nexus team against the team shit of the 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.500
 wwf in which they were and I do not follow crist horizon the knife of albacete b or c ben 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.120
 moody s coupé a queer 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.009
 really r 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.400
 the man's old man or late closing a surprise friend 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.949
 and the surprise buddy was then a live bastard 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.110
 puel daniel bra llanes 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.979
 and then all of us that have 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.979
 the two front fingers we said 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.879
 but you also do not like it 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.570
 they eliminate it the first of the year 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.140
 register now but it is the biggest shit that has stepped on a ring in the 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.190
 history of wrestling in general is more I think that yes it's going is even a 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.740
 little better than that fucking son of a bitch that we hope will get him back 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.270
 dismiss and do not want to go and a cleaner I hit him with a mop 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.620
 dirty water and on the face 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.430
 and that the shit gets in his eyes and when a truck goes to the hospital 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.140
 from the trash it ran over and over and that all the shit fell on top of his 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.360
 disfigured corpse 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.599
 that's what I hope it happens 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.960
 I see that the survivor falls 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.310
 I'm glad that the future champion of the wwww 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.600
 the miserable one and he burst it with a varetazo that I wish he had given him a 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.039
 traumatic brain injury of those 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.319
 Well, I do not know since it was on 24 you saw that besides the citizen he 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.559
 alone to the last two of the nexus 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.979
 well, imagine 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.460
 the whole event to shit for a fight 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.750
 We were already looking at the section that I told you that you could present 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.990
 thank goodness you've remembered here is the new 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.779
 the fopac of the day 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.969
 in the seats of today we can see a person 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.900
 is the one you know is your friend and former gardener the baobab and 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.189
 you with a couple of tons more 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.249
 it seems to me that you can go forgetting I will do in your whim composed by 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:43.379
 at least try not to fall belly to not hire your rival 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.699
 well and now to summarize samer slam in general that was well on track but that 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.069
 he fucked up a lot in the last fight to get Daniel back 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.819
 gollan de los cojones that we hope to be fired again for any other 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:55.899
 thing 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:56.780
 no that's all 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.150
 if you did not like me to insult daniel brayan worse for you in the background 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.170
 It knows it's a shit if it's more since makes that payment earn a title 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.059
 that combat directly nor do I put it in the results 

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:12.889
 then there is the thing we see in champions myths within a month 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.500
 already know their divine and all those shits that are said 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.500
 Far from pop 

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:32.409
 signed
