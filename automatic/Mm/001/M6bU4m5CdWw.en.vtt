00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.179 
system info before we get to the other
thing<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> CPU<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.049> b7<00:01:04.500> -<00:01:04.619> 1<00:01:04.799> 5<00:01:05.010> 3

see the scrolling goes quite smooth it's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.300 
see the scrolling goes quite smooth it's
faster<00:01:42.150> than<00:01:42.390> expected<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.680> single<00:01:44.070> core

processor and if you want to look
further<00:01:47.040> into<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.000> double<00:01:48.299> tap

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
further into it you can just double tap
