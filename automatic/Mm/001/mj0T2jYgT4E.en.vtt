00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that it could be forever so I was really

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.850 
that it could be forever so I was really
under<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> impression<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.710> would

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
under the impression that they would

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.290 
under the impression that they would
give<00:00:47.010> us<00:00:47.100> some<00:00:47.309> medicine<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.149> go

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
give us some medicine and it would go

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
give us some medicine and it would go
away<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.899> she<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.800> getting<00:00:50.250> worse
