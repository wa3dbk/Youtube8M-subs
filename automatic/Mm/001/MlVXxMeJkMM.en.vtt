00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it's called D Onion Router and it routes

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.119 
it's called D Onion Router and it routes
the<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:32.399> makes<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.989> internet<00:00:33.989> slower<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.910> it

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
the it makes the internet slower but it

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.530 
the it makes the internet slower but it
makes<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.370> people<00:00:38.820> can't<00:00:39.059> see<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.420> you're

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
makes it so people can't see what you're

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.799 
makes it so people can't see what you're
doing<00:00:39.870> which<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.170> good<00:00:40.559> because<00:00:41.809> censorship

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
doing which is good because censorship

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.410 
doing which is good because censorship
and<00:00:43.020> things<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.739> wrong<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.270> let's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and things like that are wrong and let's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.340 
and things like that are wrong and let's
just<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:46.020> nasty<00:00:46.379> stuff<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.550> um<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
just really nasty stuff but um so the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.220 
just really nasty stuff but um so the
first<00:00:49.620> thing<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> need<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.579> open<00:00:50.820> Cydia

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.569 

loading<00:00:55.230> takes<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.620> while<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.219> pain

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
loading takes a while which is a pain

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.270 
loading takes a while which is a pain
but<00:00:57.420> there's<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.809> faster<00:00:58.320> loading<00:00:58.559> tweak<00:00:58.890> maybe

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
but there's a faster loading tweak maybe

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.819 
but there's a faster loading tweak maybe
I'll<00:00:59.570> talk<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:01.170> tweaks<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.649> have

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
I'll talk about some tweaks that I have

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.210 
I'll talk about some tweaks that I have
in<00:01:01.980> another<00:01:02.070> video<00:01:02.660> because<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:04.470> really

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
in another video because that's really

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190

open a new page and go to check tor

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.690 
open a new page and go to check tor
project<00:03:41.019> org

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:59.470 

tor<00:03:54.340> project.org<00:03:55.340> g<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:58.220> then<00:03:58.400> go<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.360> the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
tor project.org g and then go and so the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.059 
tor project.org g and then go and so the
internet<00:03:59.840> will<00:03:59.989> be<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.170> little<00:04:00.319> slower<00:04:00.560> as<00:04:00.890> you

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
internet will be a little slower as you

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.460 
internet will be a little slower as you
can<00:04:01.250> see<00:04:01.459> it's<00:04:01.610> taking<00:04:01.880> you<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> while<00:04:02.319> which<00:04:03.319> is

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
can see it's taking you a while which is

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.559 
can see it's taking you a while which is
a<00:04:03.500> pain<00:04:03.770> but<00:04:04.130> like<00:04:04.520> I<00:04:04.670> said<00:04:04.880> earlier<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.300> think

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
a pain but like I said earlier I think

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.250 
a pain but like I said earlier I think
it's<00:04:05.720> worth<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:07.300> so<00:04:08.300> as<00:04:08.660> soon<00:04:08.840> as<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.140> loads

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
it's worth it and so as soon as it loads

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.920 
it's worth it and so as soon as it loads
it'll<00:04:09.950> tell<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.370> either<00:04:11.000> yes<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.810> are

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
it'll tell you either yes you are

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.050 
it'll tell you either yes you are
connected<00:04:12.440> or<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.040> know<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.220> aren't<00:04:13.550> connected

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
connected or I know you aren't connected

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.930 
connected or I know you aren't connected
and<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:15.739> think<00:04:16.040> there<00:04:16.160> might<00:04:16.280> be<00:04:16.340> an<00:04:16.519> issue<00:04:16.639> with

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
and I think there might be an issue with

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.610 
and I think there might be an issue with
mine<00:04:17.090> right<00:04:17.269> now<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.870> it's<00:04:18.350> not

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
