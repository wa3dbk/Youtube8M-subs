00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.650
 at youtube jupiter is the money one has 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 by and welcome to stop 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 We comment on the gameplay here 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.029
 social gossip 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.890
 Welcome to the Friday of the staircase week 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.630
 Today in the background of a triple if that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 whole plays only from the black shops 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.529
 gameplay is really sick on everyone 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.720
 case correctly sparked me right 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.400
 also pleases if it is first with it 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.110
 actually completely no matter because no idea 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.329
 I personally stand up more like that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.880
 gameplays bosbach same and you have to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.440
 just perfect is so 100 percent and 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.230
 that in the gameplay I find it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.060
 definitely right on each and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.750
 therefore looks in any case at the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.710
 black ops over the 505 have 1950 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.780
 definitely make him if you are 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.250
 of course, also the six kv 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.720
 In any case judge would be the boys 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.530
 would be really happy about that 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.270
 I just think and last on everyone 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.830
 nike also does the noah for saas 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.670
 disease gameplay and thus is easy 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.390
 not my topic 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.729
 and that's what I thought about 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.650
 documented mp3 gameplay and the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.330
 report for example yesterday 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.350
 I believe yesterday or the day before yesterday I 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.750
 do not know anything a triple camp of mine 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 commented and then there are also 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.840
 still triple nuclear and so on and 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.750
 so on and I 've been haye 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.479
 quite honest for us what or which 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.190
 games or away the cod parts do you like 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.740
 actually most or 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.140
 why is this and max world the of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.940
 or does he find that of treyarch so the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 black ops row or he the modern one 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.220
 warfare row or what 's there 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.020
 still or baseless so and me personally 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.210
 must say for my part i like the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 Infinity was a lot much better and row 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.409
 that actually has no in itself 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.030
 really specific reason but either way 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.470
 a decisive reason but me 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.040
 just find in the whole infinity 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.950
 became one 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.680
 that's just so i dont know how it is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.990
 to express the fall that is in 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.549
 that weapons handling is in my eyes 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.470
 better so no idea is easy 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.170
 cool that feels cool so if you 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.769
 plays alone the specials bonus power 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 for me all black ops parts unimportant 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.020
 So I came there I told myself 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.310
 that I now have such black ops at all 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.440
 I did not celebrate that for me 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.410
 bad was in opinion but that can yes 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.819
 everyone see and 5 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.709
 league together black ops 2 shit and such 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.690
 next , no idea is just easy 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.099
 my opinion and I know for example 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.160
 whether that's the rainbow or too 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.390
 Much of the black ops think the same way 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.950
 and now that I know 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.080
 not exactly as she puts it 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.400
 just so you can wash without end 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.600
 clearly one could in black ops 2 for 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.910
 also wash example 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.120
 but I found that to wash in 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.860
 quotes slowly compared 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.540
 to the infiniti judging channel and the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.940
 special of the bonus has so much for me 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.530
 that much already changes that way 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.630
 it's just so much more of a paradox 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.740
 possibilities small mp3 values special 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.610
 the nation should not fool ourselves, we 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.110
 just overboard 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.480
 you could run through it as 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.400
 the opponents would be nothing and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.230
 Nevertheless, he wants to play that 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.720
 I want to say but it was 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.480
 easy or it's just so much 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.680
 horny if you all the time 24 7 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.110
 just by the enemy 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.180
 a guest could wash it as well 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.420
 soon also ghost gameplays eg white 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.010
 I seem to clear that yes 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.430
 also occupy 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.630
 yes, I think just prove it means yes 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.370
 what i just say just that 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.050
 Session of the Federal now I do so 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.840
 a praise for the special of the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.790
 nation but no one and this one 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.980
 small factor of power makes for me 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.230
 whole infinity was row or what is called 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.870
 the whole of the infinity was in turn 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.360
 so mp3s just better for me 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.220
 so clearly in mw2 there once was 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.200
 but not yet mw1 and played 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.450
 wash constantly as you wanted 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.250
 and somehow I'd no idea two 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.900
 just the people who know each other 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.250
 like two know that the marathon 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.890
 the firepower must be brought in 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.670
 packed what else one asked no 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.070
 I do not care 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.140
 did you catch the ump with the 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.330
 shit on it so are the opponents 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.770
 marched you have your sky of the post 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.290
 suddenly a chopper or your art 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.270
 it all at once the newpark has it cool 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.130
 It felt good it was 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.170
 or it feels cool when you do that 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.240
 do about the missing me just like that at 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.790
 the revered cities eg to black ops 1 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.480
 was so boring for me so boring slowly 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.410
 It was just so, so no idea 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.970
 anyway a retiree 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.280
 Suter I do not know that we just too 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.280
 slow and black ops 2 as well 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.840
 so slow compared to at least 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.370
 can it somehow mean the charger 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.230
 faster than him, for example 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.030
 just the battlefield 3 no question 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.520
 that it is not hard but im 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.050
 compared to the finds there is pure 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.970
 That's easy 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.770
 too slow for me or what is meant to be 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.419
 slow is just slower that way and that 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.310
 Take me somewhere so the fun 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.870
 butt and I play it personally 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.720
 dear the infinity row I am 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.400
 Honestly that's just me 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.500
 warschau friendly and that pleases 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.210
 Me the style of the so and now 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.740
 can you definitely give me yours? 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.539
 Write opinion on what you like 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.979
 better treasurer infinity, let it be 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.750
 to know me in the comments though 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.370
 be possible commented do not forget 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.370
 until next time downhill
