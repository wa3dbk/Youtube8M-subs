 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.910
 I bring you a way to know what 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.440
 Both ram memory supports our pc 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.690
 since many people have asked 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
 how much ram memory can I get 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.039
 expand to my computer now I'm going 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.900
 to show an easy and simple way 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.570
 to know without having to take the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 computer to technical service 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.949
 let's start, we'll go to the link that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.949
 I'll leave in the description of the video 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.390
 the link will take us to this page here 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.390
 we go where it says system scanner 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.500
 and then we click on sky computer 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.030
 we select this box accepting the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.340
 terms and contracts we click and we are 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.040
 download a file but do not panic 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.260
 that is not a virus or anything like that 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.150
 Once downloaded we open the file 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.000
 that we were downloaded and redirected 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.430
 to the next page we wait until 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.560
 I finished scanning where we 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.330
 will show what kind of memory we have and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.360
 how much can we expand the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.310
 good ram memory once it's finished 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.979
 as we can see it will show us the brand and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.130
 model of our computer and we can 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.440
 see what kind of ram memory is among the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.670
 different memories that there are as is 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:36.100

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.270
 etcetera how can you see mine is ddr3 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.690
 shows that I can expand my memory 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.110
 ram up to 16 gigs now I have 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.899
