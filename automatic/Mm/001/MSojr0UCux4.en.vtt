00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:10.989
 news corp 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.909
 the young jonathan todd gold since a few years 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.960
 but I still have trouble 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.779
 to make this moderate rise to keep that I think it's for 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.369
 exercise because I find at short notice in midfield it's all 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.529
 alone in front of a wall 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.019
 catharines we know the driers 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.210
 the godfather of the page 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.310
 for some time I have been impressed by stoning 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.130
 google street view that allows you to see landscapes and mutuals 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.440
 the beautiful forehand on the ground 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.670
 besides the budget it was necessary to spread the mode of displacement to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 foot do it by a structure with the mouse and clicks that I find the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680
 more natural with them 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.840
 I do not do their studies 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 browsing and scrutinize more natural 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.540
 and that's how you I went to barrel of the north gate with 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.550
 him 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.120
 he is very vague 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.410
 so i searched on the internet i saw that a few people aboard the iss 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.450
 had already done that explain that a lot to do and that's how 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.410
 I decided to start 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.410
 I see it's the result 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.180
 the new trailer 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 the resort has the beast in the southern alps 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.220
 the ofac struck at more than specify in the final part what is 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.510
 surprising 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 individually 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.260
 remind him 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.610
 problem I'm doing 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 the strong man of his parents 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 in these pages for what is 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.700
 the three for that triggers 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.140
 before his death 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 the new law 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.990
 I stop here 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.140
 to admire the panorama 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.100
 watch the peaks of mercantour porcelain have modest incomes 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.130
 that one 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.720
 that do not allow to point the point of view 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.639
 I can also look to the right to the left 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.829
 willingness 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.089
 but also some media 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.239
 so that does not change it allows to choose actions in the future 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.459
 I will go to Khartoum Stadium 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.459
 but progress is possible 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.619
 the territory 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.239
 here I see d'astana 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 Bernard Laporte 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.039
 here I stop I'll be at the top 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.919
 this panorama 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.279
 So how does it work 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.279
 especially via sensors on the move 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.769
 if the lobby effect sensors 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.579
 which detects that passing 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.309
 as soon as they are 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.539
 placed under the pedal the pedal laps range the ball goes through two 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.209
 what she did try 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.059
 that is to say if the electric and stone boyer 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.459
 the organizer 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.559
 my client 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:45.079
 so the joysticks 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.790
 I allow you to choose the direction it is not right vocation 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.229
 or left 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.229
 it's as simple as it sends a signal 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.479
 he promised 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.479
 everything comes back in video which is no but he was here 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.650
 during a visit this higher price than in the microprocessor and 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.089
 other outings 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:08.839
 in addition the center nc to receive I took only a handful both 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.549
 can go in the sense of humor with the output so in this case here 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.499
 receives it 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.219
 appointed in the middle of the lobby effect sensors their daily controller 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.219
 direction they are phony 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.559
 a success that pays his taxes fill 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.640
 Kigali had drawn in addition received the dies 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.570
 who determined what are the exit signs to handle he grabs an exit 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.540
 children suffering from NATO command 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.540
 you receive by the club and this all the way save him 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.479
 of death 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.300
 all the more disappointing on the orders compared to the respect of the 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.449
 standard in meeting 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.960
 but for a small 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.199
 he transforms his orders 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.680
 because the best delays of the keys of the keyboard the goal to control what makes them 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.599
 touch 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:54.800
 the harbor 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.080
 put the rails 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.209
 I'm not used to moving in the same line to move forward 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.839
 for now Europe 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:09.109
 for this edition a little gadget I am well aware I assure you in 

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:11.159
 noting that a few weeks 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.949
 daerden five best goalkeepers the metronome of blackcurrant of the apartment 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.599
 the 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.430
 in that case 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.860
 everything will see the light at night as the climate outside 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.370
 e 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.370
 since the time I can aim for the podium 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.609
 even its current law business in the far away world hotels 

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:33.210
 managed 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.460
 at the day 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.419
 on the other hand a post no I bike now there are wheels 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.740
 when I found myself more faure him 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.330
 according to the study 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.500
 it's a very nice place
