00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.040 
finds out that we need shoring or pipe
matching<00:00:09.330> he's<00:00:09.510> still<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> be<00:00:09.929> in

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
matching he's still going to be in

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.299 
matching he's still going to be in
charge<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:10.650> well<00:00:10.679> as<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.099> buyer

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
charge of that as well as the buyer

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.030 
charge of that as well as the buyer
right<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:13.080> right<00:00:13.290> now<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.500> think<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.920> it

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
right so right now we think that it

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.379 
right so right now we think that it
might<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> buyer<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> other<00:00:15.120> side<00:00:15.360> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
might be a buyer on the other side of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.060 
might be a buyer on the other side of
this<00:00:15.540> door<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.650> way<00:00:16.770> we're<00:00:16.890> going<00:00:16.980> to

this door this is the way we're going to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.710 
this door this is the way we're going to
access<00:00:17.369> every<00:00:17.640> space<00:00:17.850> even<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.420> going

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
access every space even if we're going

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.179 
access every space even if we're going
all<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.410> way<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.710> other<00:00:19.800> side<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
all the way to the other side of the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.679 
all the way to the other side of the
ship<00:00:20.279> where<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.640> know<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> fire<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.420> we're

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
ship where we know the fire is we're

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.820 
ship where we know the fire is we're
still<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> access<00:00:22.380> every<00:00:22.619> space

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
still going to access every space

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.910 
still going to access every space
likeness<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.250> we're<00:00:23.550> going<00:00:23.699> even<00:00:24.420> ere<00:00:24.570> long

so we're going to have that access thing

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.609 
so we're going to have that access thing
which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> first<00:00:27.750> man<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> home<00:00:28.439> front

reason we're going to ask permission to
access<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> spaces<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.770> don't<00:00:38.219> think<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
access the spaces we don't think that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
access the spaces we don't think that
there's<00:00:38.670> anything<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.050> took<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
there's anything here but if we took a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
there's anything here but if we took a
missile<00:00:40.710> hit<00:00:40.890> or<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.489> hit<00:00:41.640> something<00:00:41.940> we

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
missile hit or if we hit something we

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.150 
missile hit or if we hit something we
don't<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.199> space<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> filled<00:00:44.129> with

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
don't know this space is filled with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
don't know this space is filled with
water<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.910> fair<00:00:45.059> Locker<00:00:45.300> DC

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
water but there are fair Locker DC

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.690 
water but there are fair Locker DC
central

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
central

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.190 
central
so<00:00:47.060> we<00:00:47.210> don't<00:00:47.360> want<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.570> access<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:47.990> if<00:00:48.080> we

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
so we don't want to access it if we

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.870 
so we don't want to access it if we
already<00:00:48.290> know<00:00:48.470> that<00:00:48.500> it's<00:00:49.130> messed<00:00:49.340> up<00:00:49.490> we'd

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
already know that it's messed up we'd

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.270 
already know that it's messed up we'd
have<00:00:49.970> to<00:00:50.030> all<00:00:50.240> right<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.710> confirmation

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
have to all right so the confirmation

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.380 
have to all right so the confirmation
access<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.730> space

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.870 

then<00:00:55.930> all<00:00:56.079> those<00:00:56.290> teams<00:00:57.250> going<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.579> turn<00:00:57.760> on

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
then all those teams going to turn on

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
into his face it could be on fire do you

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.680 
into his face it could be on fire do you
like<00:01:02.379> your<00:01:02.680> lo's<00:01:03.010> doesn't<00:01:03.400> work<00:01:03.520> right<00:01:03.760> so

like your lo's doesn't work right so
they're<00:01:04.869> going<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.080> charge<00:01:05.110> those<00:01:05.560> don't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250

actually charge the hose is going to

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.390 
actually charge the hose is going to
open<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.320> bail<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.860> he's<00:01:11.890> going<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.190> cycle

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
open the bail and he's going to cycle

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.680 
open the bail and he's going to cycle

all the way through all the way to wide

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.090 
all the way through all the way to wide
angle<00:01:13.720> which<00:01:14.140> we<00:01:14.259> did<00:01:14.440> out<00:01:14.590> there<00:01:14.619> with<00:01:15.040> all

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
angle which we did out there with all

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.260 
angle which we did out there with all
those<00:01:15.220> demo<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:15.640> then<00:01:15.729> all<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.850> way<00:01:15.910> back<00:01:15.970> to

those demo and then all the way back to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.859 
those demo and then all the way back to
solid<00:01:16.570> screen<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.940> narrow<00:01:19.119> angle<00:01:19.330> plug<00:01:19.659> which

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
solid screen to narrow angle plug which

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.300 
solid screen to narrow angle plug which
is<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.110> first<00:01:20.259> thing<00:01:20.500> you<00:01:20.530> guys<00:01:20.740> didn't<00:01:21.040> round

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
is the first thing you guys didn't round

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.620 
is the first thing you guys didn't round
right<00:01:21.580> so<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.600> answer<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.540> guy

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
right so the answer so the guy

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.060 
right so the answer so the guy
information<00:01:26.020> access<00:01:26.350> space<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:26.860> going<00:01:27.009> to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
information access space is going to

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.469 
information access space is going to
look<00:01:27.190> through<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> porthole<00:01:27.820> see<00:01:28.270> there's

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
look through the porthole see there's

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.690 
look through the porthole see there's
any<00:01:28.630> obvious<00:01:28.750> signs<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.289> fire<00:01:29.500> floating<00:01:30.039> what

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
any obvious signs of fire floating what

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.590 
any obvious signs of fire floating what
finally<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.120> he's<00:01:33.300> get<00:01:33.480> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
finally all right now he's get it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.180 
finally all right now he's get it
because<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.440> fire<00:01:34.620> might<00:01:34.800> have<00:01:34.950> been<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
because the fire might have been in

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.170 
because the fire might have been in
there<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.430> might<00:01:35.550> he<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.760> burned<00:01:35.910> itself

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
there and might he just burned itself

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
there and might he just burned itself
out<00:01:36.390> who<00:01:36.630> isn't<00:01:36.930> waiting<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.440> some<00:01:37.530> oxygen

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
out who isn't waiting for some oxygen

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.650 
out who isn't waiting for some oxygen
he's<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.910> check<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.330> see<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.540> there's

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
he's going to check and see if there's

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.120 
he's going to check and see if there's
any<00:01:39.840> heat<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:40.350> he's<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> take<00:01:40.830> off<00:01:41.010> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
any heat so he's going to take off the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.860 
any heat so he's going to take off the
back<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> his<00:01:41.580> glove<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.060> he's<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.780> use

back of his glove and he's going to use
the<00:01:42.960> back<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.320> his<00:01:43.380> hand<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.890> half<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.490> inch

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
the back of his hand about half an inch

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.950 
the back of his hand about half an inch
away<00:01:44.730> from<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.090> door<00:01:45.270> he's<00:01:45.480> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.690> go<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.900> a

away from the door he's going to go on a
Z<00:01:46.110> pattern<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.680> top<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> bottom<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.390> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
Z pattern from top to bottom this is so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.360 
Z pattern from top to bottom this is so
at<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.810> end<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.500> burns<00:01:49.770> himself<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.250> on

at the end if you burns himself with on

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.830 
at the end if you burns himself with on
the<00:01:50.460> back<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.790> his<00:01:50.850> hand<00:01:51.000> he's<00:01:51.360> still<00:01:51.600> some

holding<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.610> way<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> door<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> shaken<00:02:13.650> this

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
holding the way to door in a shaken this

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.830 
holding the way to door in a shaken this
is<00:02:14.160> once<00:02:14.790> again<00:02:14.910> no<00:02:15.120> utilize<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.599> pressure

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
is once again no utilize the pressure

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.839 
is once again no utilize the pressure
yet<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.709> there's<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.980> fire<00:02:17.160> inside<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.760> it's

yet so there's a fire inside and it's
getting<00:02:18.000> oxygen<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.690> not<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.140> explode

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
getting oxygen it's not going to explode

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.440 
getting oxygen it's not going to explode
out<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.069> backdraft<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.299> going

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
out like in backdraft and it's not going
