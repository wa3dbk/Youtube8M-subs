00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:24.370
 Introducing kc Burns's fork flute 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:27.970
 kc Bards is a craftsman making Irish flutes in the US for over 30 years 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:31.570
 Many of the images that I imagined this time are called flutes 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.270
 It should be said that it is a model for practice of Irish flute 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:41.290
 It is a wooden flute 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:44.920
 There are two types of materials: one with the following one and one with the Copter 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.990
 Because the next is made of soft material than the black who 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.440
 Nail also soft also came'm more of 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.700
 Hard sound quality because it is made of solid liquid 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:02.490
 And the volume also increases slightly 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:05.720
 And Shrimp prepared wide type and narrow type and two kinds 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.720
 When compared to employment 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:16.830
 I think that you can understand the pillar difference of the width 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:21.030
 Suppressed especially neat in the way of small woman's hand in a well person who initiated the Irish flute 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:27.840
 Some people are worried if you can 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.520
 It is the smaller root of the finger holes of and probably, I think whether it is possible to suppress the use without problems 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.570
 I will 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.810
 The dead of this area 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.430
 The larger one is slightly larger but 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.880
 There is not so much difference in the pitch volume head 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.979
 If you drop it into 10 sizes and knit it 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.820
 By the way , about the procedure of how this fork attempt is different from the usual 2 round route 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.030
 But 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.110
 First of all 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.290
 Here is the end cap 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.220
 It is equipped, but I do not have to shake 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.230
 Effort is gone as it is 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.490
 And 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.929
 An Irish flute is called a tuning slide 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.600
 There is almost nothing, but this flute has no tuning slide 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.380
 Hmm 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:24.310
 And you may be wondering if you can not do missions inside 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.870
 The adjusted by connecting or disconnecting the between between the I's are tuning and here of the head tube left hand 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 can do 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.690
 Instead of 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.730
 Because a gap will be made 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.319
 A little on the process of high temperature city 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.690
 There may be a laugh 10 going up 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.890
 I think that it is a range that hardly bothers now 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.620
 then 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.950
 Normally the Irish flute is followed by a ring like this 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.650
 Prevent the wood from spreading with moisture 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:00.590
 I have another party but I can not compare it 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.849
 The wood used in the 4 flutes is better than the better of the route made by machine kc burg 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.549
 Some 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:10.269
 The clause may be difficult to carry or woody, but this also affects the nail 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.269
 There is no 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.890
 Then I 'll blow this time Today is mid- July 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:27.330
 The room temperature is about 30 degrees and I have to skip it 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.330
 I can not adjust the pitch, but I think that I can not usually reach here 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.340
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.300
 goo 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.150
 Already 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.950
 Hm 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.340
