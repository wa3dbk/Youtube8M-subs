00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.230
 i 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.610
 you know recently in Mexico I've noticed 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.860
 a big increase in terms of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.570
 game development concerns 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.580
 lately I do not know if they are bearing fruit 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.440
 in schools or if it's the fact that 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.240
 the tools are more accessible than 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.580
 never but the point is that you have to 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.160
 celebrate this increase in development 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.869
 in inspector that I will be my part and 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.179
 I'm going to present these projects that 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.189
 are currently being developed in Mexico and 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.290
 whether they have left or they are in 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.750
 good development to start then 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.900
 let me recommend a project that 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.340
 I found out days ago called bullaka a 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.250
 project that is currently in 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.360
 kickstarter and has taken us by surprise 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.700
 mullah which is an adventure action game 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.040
 and I pose a developed based on the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.230
 mythology of the rarámuris the ethnic group 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.870
 most recognized tarahumara of chihuahua 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.210
 mexico in the story we take the role 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.460
 from a rarámuri called a mule here 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.530
 will have at your disposal a series of 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.230
 weapons and special abilities that he possesses 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.390
 thank you to make a sure amen what 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.400
 they are basically the shamans of the tribe 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.290
 Tarahumara remembers from my video of 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.270
 games in mexico as I mentioned that the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.490
 students in Mexico in a row try to 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.130
 make stories based on mythology 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.439
 and they fail the reason for this 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.030
 failure is that they really do not get in 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.310
 background with the culture they want 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.869
 represent and do nothing outside of what 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.909
 ordinary that could draw attention 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.610
 of a gamer any 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.340
 times seem to be changing and mule 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.840
 that represents that kind of change not yet 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 I can say a lot given that it is in 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.429
 early stages of development it shows 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.950
 that the canvas team that is 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.409
 precisely in chihuahua it is really 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.179
 involved with the Rarámuri culture in 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.039
 your presentation video can see the 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.720
 living together with the people and 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.940
 it shows that they want to publicize their 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.130
 culture through a game that does not 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.350
 disappoint and if something tell me the years 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.959
 of player is and when you make a game 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.840
 with much love to anything it shows 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.280
 and we only win the players between 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.830
 main features of the game 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.560
 excels his art direction which 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.080
 apparently it's something colorful minimalistic 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.000
 and stylized the art of some scenes 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.340
 well it looks like something out of a movie 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 of ghibli and when they compare you to one 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.239
 of the best animation studios 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.940
 Japanese well I think you're doing 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.800
 something good to me in particular what more 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.630
 It is striking that it is based on 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.670
 the Tarahumara mythology since I am 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.530
 fan of mythology in general and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.940
 both the cultures that still inhabit 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.370
 in Mexico as cultures 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.680
 Pre-Columbian are without a doubt incredible 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.750
 one of my favorite books is in fact 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.760
 the popol vuh take some time to 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.710
 read it and you will see how exciting it is 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.170
 get into the world view of these 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.760
 cultures the just think the kind of 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.500
 creatures and legends that this has 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480
 culture is what makes it very 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.730
 pending of this game the game 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.530
 recently just released a campaign 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.180
 of crist art earl where they explain by 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.910
 Complete the features of the game 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.740
 in case you are interested here I will leave 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.020
 the page in the description of this 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.330
 video and sites where you can know more 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.250
 about the game and previously campaigns 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.650
 of Mexican games have been supported 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.260
 like hardcore line hopefully and every time 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.090
 let's see more that I achieved it I already put of my 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.310
 part and I really hope to see the game 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.350
 when the game price actually comes out 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.540
 it will be 10 dollars a price too 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.580
 cheap for the project vicious 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.770
 one of the parts that I like the most 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.570
 video is where they explain that a part of 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.370
 the kickstarter donation will go 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.799
 direct to the preservation of this great 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.959
 culture that still lives in our country and 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.489
 let's hope he always does and for the 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.110
 that they always complain on the page with 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.840
 the comment that they do not know English 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.060
 You can see everything in Spanish in the same 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760
 kickstarter page to see that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.010
 there are no excuses, that's all 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.659
 moment usually I always find out 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.760
 quickly of new Mexican games 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.500
 but if you are a developer in 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.290
 mexico and you have an interesting project 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.120
 and with a lot of work on please 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.579

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.500
