00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.549
 just and tonight we're talking about a 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.040
 profound change of habit of 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.260
 French buy new products 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.519
 is no longer an obligation since 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.469
 long time the second hand market has 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.880
 found its place in our country but 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.430
 now this is also the case for 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.590
 gifts one in two people thinks 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.250

 second-hand products 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.840
 used cars that will also find their 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.700
 place under the tree 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.790
 second-hand games at 50 euros instead of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.980
 300 here once I would have withdrawn 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.960
 even if the halal label absolutely 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.539
 nine goes much hungry volcano 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 also bought used a way to 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 pay less and consume 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.210
 otherwise it is simply no 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.010
 need to necessarily go through 2009 you 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.570
 buy something or use it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.870
 serves you the more you sell it's 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.280
 the new object he works like him a 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.659
 French in two is willing to offer 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.119
 a used product 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.010
 this customer in full test of a hi 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.240
 fi even plans to buy several 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.659
 second-hand items a dozen 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.050
 gift that I have to do 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.240
 there may be other opportunities 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.890
 a budget issue also has a but 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.440
 the second-hand market explodes especially 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.990
 on the internet tablet computers 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.910
 phones and play any kind the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.400
 search for the lowest prices remains the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.120
 priority of the consumer even during 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.070
 celebrations 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.240
 there are a lot less taboos around 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.560
 the occasion probably because 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.660
 the economy has made us very convenient 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.280
 very pragmatic finally people do not 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.760
 are not bothered by receiving gifts 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.620
 second hand 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.780
 and then less and less people who 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.340
 offer used gifts 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.710
 finally are embarrassed or in this case he 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.180
 assumes more and more he besides the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.770
 consumers do not even hesitate to 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.420
 sell their own gifts to 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.890
 The day after Christmas 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.010
 enough to feed this market 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.280
 the occasion a trip 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.280
