00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
went through after the video and blended

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.240 
went through after the video and blended
these<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.380> I'll<00:03:29.500> show<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.859> blending

these and I'll show you a blending

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.210 
these and I'll show you a blending
example<00:03:30.760> shortly<00:03:31.120> but<00:03:31.299> really<00:03:32.139> just<00:03:32.170> did<00:03:32.950> well

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
example shortly but really just did well

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.890 
example shortly but really just did well
with<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.700> layering<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.209> blending<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.750> had

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
with the layering and blending and I had

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.840 
with the layering and blending and I had
no<00:03:35.109> trouble<00:03:35.410> at<00:03:35.680> all<00:03:35.799> with<00:03:36.069> these<00:03:36.609> although

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
no trouble at all with these although

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.330 
no trouble at all with these although
they<00:03:37.090> named<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.630> flesh<00:03:38.260> tone<00:03:38.530> light<00:03:38.799> orange<00:03:39.220> I

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
they named the flesh tone light orange I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.240 
they named the flesh tone light orange I
think<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.700> was<00:03:39.819> just<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.120> language<00:03:40.540> issue<00:03:40.750> but

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
think that was just a language issue but

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.599 
think that was just a language issue but
it<00:03:42.250> was<00:03:42.489> interesting<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:43.450> flesh<00:03:44.260> tone

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
it was interesting because flesh tone

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.949 
it was interesting because flesh tone
just<00:03:45.609> they<00:03:45.850> named<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.239> light<00:03:46.450> orange<00:03:46.660> which

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
just they named it light orange which

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.870 
just they named it light orange which
was<00:03:47.200> weird<00:03:47.380> but<00:03:48.630> like<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.780> said<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.920> smooth

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
was weird but like I said just smooth

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.240 
was weird but like I said just smooth
application<00:03:52.260> easy<00:03:53.260> blend<00:03:53.680> ability<00:03:54.100> these

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
application easy blend ability these

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.670 
application easy blend ability these
sharpened<00:03:54.819> up<00:03:54.970> well<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.569> pencils<00:03:56.049> no

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
sharpened up well the pencils no

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.830 
sharpened up well the pencils no
breakage<00:03:57.340> just<00:03:58.590> not<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.489> soft<00:04:00.910> like<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> Derwent

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
breakage just not so soft like a Derwent

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.990 
breakage just not so soft like a Derwent
but<00:04:02.079> but<00:04:02.380> probably<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.040> lot<00:04:03.430> closer<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
but but probably a lot closer to the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000 
but but probably a lot closer to the
fabric<00:04:04.359> castell<00:04:04.810> polychromos

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.150 

okay<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.870> next<00:04:13.020> thing<00:04:13.230> I'm<00:04:13.470> gonna<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.130> a

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
okay the next thing I'm gonna do is a

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.070 
okay the next thing I'm gonna do is a
little<00:04:14.250> color<00:04:14.670> wheel<00:04:14.970> slick<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.600> do<00:04:15.840> some

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
little color wheel slick and do some

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.200 
little color wheel slick and do some
blending<00:04:16.350> here<00:04:16.860> and<00:04:17.040> I'm<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.370> kind<00:04:18.150> of

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
blending here and I'm just kind of

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.780 
blending here and I'm just kind of
picking<00:04:18.570> out<00:04:18.690> random<00:04:19.320> pencils<00:04:20.130> from<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.520> set

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
picking out random pencils from the set

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.820 
picking out random pencils from the set
trying<00:04:21.360> to<00:04:21.450> keep<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.780> color<00:04:21.990> groups<00:04:22.260> somewhat

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
trying to keep the color groups somewhat

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.680 
trying to keep the color groups somewhat
together<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.490> I'm<00:04:23.580> not<00:04:23.730> so<00:04:24.090> concerned<00:04:24.360> about

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
together but I'm not so concerned about

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.870 
together but I'm not so concerned about
that<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.260> end<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.680> just<00:04:26.130> want<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.550> see<00:04:26.700> how

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
that in the end I just want to see how

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.090 
that in the end I just want to see how
these<00:04:27.060> are<00:04:27.270> blend<00:04:27.540> up<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.710> what<00:04:28.890> that

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
these are blend up and and what that

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.930 
these are blend up and and what that
looks<00:04:29.400> like

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
looks like

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.500 
looks like
so<00:04:30.690> really<00:04:31.290> just<00:04:31.650> again<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.430> love<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.360> way

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
so really just again I love the way

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.440 
so really just again I love the way
these<00:04:33.750> go<00:04:34.050> down<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.650> layering<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.850> if

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
these go down and the layering and if

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.540 
these go down and the layering and if
you've<00:04:36.660> used<00:04:36.930> Mitsubishi<00:04:37.650> color<00:04:38.070> pencils

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550
