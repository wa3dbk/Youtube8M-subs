00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
instead of standing still and just

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810 
instead of standing still and just
having<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.990> beautiful<00:01:19.110> hair<00:01:19.590> campaign<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.700> add

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
beauty and movement and make it more

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.030 
beauty and movement and make it more
stylistic<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.960> added<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.619> dance

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
stylistic so they added this dance

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.420

movement<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.740> created<00:01:29.160> something

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
movement and it really created something

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160 
movement and it really created something
quite<00:01:29.729> dynamic<00:01:29.910> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.450> also<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> hair

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
