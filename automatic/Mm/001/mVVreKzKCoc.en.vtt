00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
minutes so I'm gonna start putting a bit

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.729 
minutes so I'm gonna start putting a bit
of<00:00:43.550> my<00:00:44.449> tank<00:00:44.720> water<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:46.480> every<00:00:47.590> 10<00:00:48.590> 15

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
of my tank water in now every 10 15

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:49.380 
of my tank water in now every 10 15
years<00:00:49.100> or<00:00:49.190> so

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
years or so

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.780 
years or so
so<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.450> see<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.750> levels<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.370> parameters

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
so you see the levels of the parameters

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:07.980 
so you see the levels of the parameters
in<00:00:52.910> my<00:00:53.030> tank<00:00:53.239> rapid<00:00:53.660> Earth

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.840 

so<00:01:10.119> I'm<00:01:11.119> gonna<00:01:11.210> do<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.450> another<00:01:11.780> probably

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850
