00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.540 

slow<00:00:24.410> motion<00:00:24.620> is<00:00:25.010> something<00:00:25.310> that<00:00:25.400> I've<00:00:25.520> been

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
slow motion is something that I've been

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.370 
slow motion is something that I've been
really<00:00:25.910> putting<00:00:26.330> into<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.600> lot<00:00:26.810> of<00:00:26.930> projects

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
really putting into a lot of projects

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.050 
really putting into a lot of projects
right<00:00:27.530> now<00:00:27.590> in<00:00:27.830> music<00:00:28.280> videos<00:00:28.310> it's<00:00:28.820> like<00:00:28.910> the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
right now in music videos it's like the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.610 
right now in music videos it's like the
main<00:00:29.750> thing<00:00:30.260> if<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:30.560> have<00:00:32.050> your<00:00:33.050> video<00:00:33.320> it

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
main thing if you have your video it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.990 
main thing if you have your video it
automatically<00:00:34.100> looks<00:00:34.400> like<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:34.550> music<00:00:34.910> video

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
automatically looks like a music video

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.840 
automatically looks like a music video
and<00:00:35.390> even<00:00:35.989> songs<00:00:36.380> what<00:00:37.220> they'll<00:00:37.370> do<00:00:37.580> is<00:00:37.699> I'll

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
and even songs what they'll do is I'll

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.090 
and even songs what they'll do is I'll
make<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.120> singer<00:00:38.510> sing<00:00:39.110> really<00:00:39.440> fast<00:00:39.920> then

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
make the singer sing really fast then

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.010 
make the singer sing really fast then
they'll<00:00:40.370> slow<00:00:40.699> that<00:00:40.970> down<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.720> give<00:00:41.840> it<00:00:41.930> this

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
they'll slow that down to give it this

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.470 
they'll slow that down to give it this
cool<00:00:42.410> slow<00:00:42.830> motion<00:00:43.280> look<00:00:43.670> one<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.270> things<00:00:44.390> i

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
cool slow motion look one of things i

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.180 
cool slow motion look one of things i
came<00:00:44.720> across<00:00:44.840> right<00:00:45.260> away<00:00:45.680> was<00:00:45.980> when<00:00:46.160> i

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
came across right away was when i

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.340 
came across right away was when i
brought<00:00:46.489> my<00:00:46.699> slow-motion<00:00:47.090> footage<00:00:47.449> into<00:00:48.050> my

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
brought my slow-motion footage into my

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.150 
brought my slow-motion footage into my
editing<00:00:48.650> software<00:00:49.129> which<00:00:49.340> is<00:00:49.580> why<00:00:50.199> i<00:00:51.199> realized

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
editing software which is why i realized

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.569 
editing software which is why i realized
that<00:00:52.610> there<00:00:53.239> was<00:00:53.630> this<00:00:54.020> weird<00:00:54.470> kind<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.220> frame

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
that there was this weird kind of frame

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.710 
that there was this weird kind of frame
blending<00:00:55.940> thing<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.540> looked<00:00:56.660> really

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
blending thing and it looked really

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.600 
blending thing and it looked really
choppy<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.440> kind<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.800> ghosty<00:00:58.280> ish<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:58.520> I

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
choppy and kind of ghosty ish and I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.880 
choppy and kind of ghosty ish and I
didn't<00:00:58.880> know<00:00:59.000> why<00:00:59.300> it<00:00:59.329> gave<00:00:59.630> that<00:00:59.840> effect<00:01:00.260> so

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
didn't know why it gave that effect so

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.040 
didn't know why it gave that effect so
after<00:01:01.040> research<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.059> playing<00:01:02.510> around<00:01:02.719> I

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
after research and playing around I

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.139 
after research and playing around I
found<00:01:03.320> out<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:03.980> because<00:01:04.100> your<00:01:04.729> sequence

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
found out it's because your sequence

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.450 
found out it's because your sequence
settings<00:01:05.360> aren't<00:01:05.690> set<00:01:05.990> correctly<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:07.070> before

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
settings aren't set correctly but before

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.680 
settings aren't set correctly but before
we<00:01:07.610> get<00:01:07.729> to<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:07.910> let's<00:01:08.030> go<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.570> beginning

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
we get to that let's go to the beginning

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.240 
we get to that let's go to the beginning
the<00:01:09.200> first<00:01:09.380> thing<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:09.530> want<00:01:09.649> to<00:01:09.680> focus<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:10.040> is

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
the first thing you want to focus on is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.850 
the first thing you want to focus on is
your<00:01:10.670> camera<00:01:11.149> settings<00:01:11.300> so<00:01:12.140> first<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.590> all<00:01:12.710> you

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
your camera settings so first of all you

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.350 
your camera settings so first of all you
want<00:01:13.039> to<00:01:13.100> make<00:01:13.220> sure<00:01:13.250> that<00:01:13.399> your<00:01:13.729> frame<00:01:14.330> rate

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
want to make sure that your frame rate

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.450 
want to make sure that your frame rate
is<00:01:14.660> as<00:01:14.840> high<00:01:14.869> as<00:01:15.259> possible<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.890> higher<00:01:16.070> frame

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
is as high as possible the higher frame

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.580 
is as high as possible the higher frame
rate<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:17.060> smoother<00:01:17.539> your<00:01:17.750> footage<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.289> going

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
rate the smoother your footage is going

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.010 
rate the smoother your footage is going
to<00:01:18.740> look<00:01:18.920> that's<00:01:19.160> more<00:01:19.340> pictures<00:01:19.880> per<00:01:20.539> second

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
to look that's more pictures per second

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.930 
to look that's more pictures per second
so<00:01:21.170> if<00:01:21.289> you<00:01:21.410> do<00:01:21.649> 24<00:01:22.160> frames<00:01:22.430> it's<00:01:22.640> gonna<00:01:22.789> look

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
so if you do 24 frames it's gonna look

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.050 
so if you do 24 frames it's gonna look
choppy<00:01:23.869> like<00:01:24.259> this<00:01:26.770> or<00:01:27.770> if<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.250> do<00:01:28.399> 60<00:01:28.700> frames

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
choppy like this or if you do 60 frames

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.050 
choppy like this or if you do 60 frames
it's<00:01:29.270> going<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.479> look<00:01:29.630> smooth<00:01:29.990> like<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.359 

so<00:01:34.930> once<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.170> get<00:01:35.350> your<00:01:35.500> frame<00:01:35.799> rate<00:01:35.829> to<00:01:36.250> as

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
so once you get your frame rate to as

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.370 
so once you get your frame rate to as
high<00:01:36.549> as<00:01:36.610> possible<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:37.509> your<00:01:37.659> camera<00:01:37.899> can<00:01:38.170> do

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
high as possible that your camera can do

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.260 
high as possible that your camera can do
you<00:01:38.950> want<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.250> set<00:01:39.430> your<00:01:39.579> shutter<00:01:39.820> speed<00:01:40.000> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
you want to set your shutter speed to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.139 
you want to set your shutter speed to
super<00:01:40.990> choppy<00:01:41.860> looking<00:01:42.399> usually<00:01:42.970> your

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
super choppy looking usually your

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.090 
super choppy looking usually your
shutter<00:01:43.420> speed<00:01:43.539> should<00:01:44.049> be<00:01:44.110> somewhat<00:01:44.619> double

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
shutter speed should be somewhat double

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.770 
shutter speed should be somewhat double
of<00:01:45.280> what<00:01:45.340> your<00:01:45.939> footage<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.390> if<00:01:46.600> you're

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
of what your footage is if you're

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.420 
of what your footage is if you're
shooting<00:01:46.899> 24<00:01:47.530> frames<00:01:47.829> your<00:01:48.039> shutter<00:01:48.310> speed

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
shooting 24 frames your shutter speed

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.279 
shooting 24 frames your shutter speed
should<00:01:48.850> be<00:01:49.000> around<00:01:49.180> 48<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:49.990> if<00:01:50.170> you're

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
should be around 48 and if you're

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.840 
should be around 48 and if you're
shooting<00:01:50.470> 60<00:01:51.039> frames<00:01:51.310> your<00:01:51.520> shutter<00:01:51.729> speed

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
shooting 60 frames your shutter speed

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.990 
shooting 60 frames your shutter speed
should<00:01:52.570> be<00:01:53.189> 160<00:01:54.189> but<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.369> like<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.610> crank<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:54.939> up

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
should be 160 but I like to crank it up

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.359 
should be 160 but I like to crank it up
to<00:01:55.060> even<00:01:55.390> 200<00:01:55.990> next<00:01:56.439> thing<00:01:56.649> you<00:01:56.740> want<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.009> do<00:01:57.159> is

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
make sure you're shooting with a little

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.740 
make sure you're shooting with a little
bit<00:01:59.920> more<00:02:00.100> light<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.909> higher<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.119> frame<00:02:01.539> rate

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
bit more light the higher the frame rate

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.350 
bit more light the higher the frame rate
the<00:02:01.869> less<00:02:02.079> light<00:02:02.710> gets<00:02:03.009> into<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.520> shutter<00:02:03.820> so

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the less light gets into the shutter so

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.460 
the less light gets into the shutter so
it<00:02:04.539> might<00:02:04.750> have<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:05.020> be<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.170> little<00:02:05.350> bit

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
it might have to be a little bit

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.899 
it might have to be a little bit
brighter<00:02:05.590> when<00:02:05.950> you're<00:02:06.100> dealing<00:02:06.280> with<00:02:06.490> lower

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
brighter when you're dealing with lower

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.359 
brighter when you're dealing with lower
shutter<00:02:07.420> speeds<00:02:07.780> like<00:02:07.990> 60<00:02:08.560> frames<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.100> should

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
shutter speeds like 60 frames you should

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.100 
shutter speeds like 60 frames you should
be<00:02:09.489> pretty<00:02:09.700> safe<00:02:09.819> but<00:02:10.509> lets<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.750> start<00:02:10.869> hiking

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
be pretty safe but lets you start hiking

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.990 
be pretty safe but lets you start hiking
up<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> hundreds<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.250> starts<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.880> get

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
up to the hundreds it starts to get

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520 
up to the hundreds it starts to get
darker<00:02:13.630> that's<00:02:13.930> because<00:02:14.170> there's<00:02:14.350> less<00:02:14.470> light

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
darker that's because there's less light

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.710 
darker that's because there's less light
going<00:02:15.010> into<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.519> shutter<00:02:15.760> when<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.330> opening

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
going into the shutter when it's opening

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.250 
going into the shutter when it's opening
because<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.140> going<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.620> fast<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.519> science

that is the ghost effect that I was

talking about before that's because the

put your footage into slow motion for me
I<00:03:17.239> always<00:03:17.390> put<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.900> about<00:03:18.080> seventy<00:03:18.650> percent

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
I always put it to about seventy percent

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.380 
I always put it to about seventy percent
to<00:03:19.340> start<00:03:19.610> with<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:19.849> that's<00:03:19.970> where<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.239> go

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
to start with so that's where you go

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.960 
to start with so that's where you go
into<00:03:20.660> your<00:03:20.690> settings<00:03:21.260> speed<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.130> then<00:03:22.430> slow

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
into your settings speed and then slow

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.259 
into your settings speed and then slow
it<00:03:23.120> down<00:03:24.040> if<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.220> still<00:03:25.459> looks<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.790> little<00:03:25.910> fast

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
it down if it still looks a little fast

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.970 
it down if it still looks a little fast
change<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> percentage<00:03:27.200> accordingly<00:03:27.739> it's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
change the percentage accordingly it's

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.699 
change the percentage accordingly it's
all<00:03:28.280> up<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.540> keep<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.349> mind<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
all up to you just keep in mind the

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.860 
all up to you just keep in mind the
slower<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.099> go<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.430> chop<00:03:31.970> your<00:03:32.150> your<00:03:32.510> footage

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
slower you go the chop your your footage

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.199 
slower you go the chop your your footage
will<00:03:33.080> end<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.349> looking<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.099> with<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.730> footage

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
will end up looking so with this footage

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.759 
will end up looking so with this footage
we're<00:03:35.390> going<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.569> put<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.989> around<00:03:36.260> fifty

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
we're going to put it to around fifty

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.350 
we're going to put it to around fifty
percent<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.370> we'll<00:03:38.000> get<00:03:38.120> something<00:03:38.239> that

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
percent and we'll get something that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.460 
percent and we'll get something that
looks<00:03:38.420> like<00:03:38.569> this<00:03:43.690> just<00:03:44.690> for<00:03:44.870> kicks<00:03:45.110> we'll<00:03:45.319> put

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
looks like this just for kicks we'll put

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.140 
looks like this just for kicks we'll put
it<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.650> ten<00:03:45.860> percent<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.670> looks<00:03:46.819> like<00:03:46.880> this

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
it to ten percent and it looks like this

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.940 
it to ten percent and it looks like this
so<00:03:47.750> as<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.019> see<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.530> first<00:03:48.739> bit<00:03:48.920> of

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
so as you can see the first bit of

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.229 
so as you can see the first bit of
footage<00:03:49.220> looks<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> little<00:03:49.579> bit<00:03:49.730> smoother<00:03:50.090> than

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
footage looks a little bit smoother than

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.569 
footage looks a little bit smoother than
the<00:03:50.329> second<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.860> slower<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.250> go<00:03:52.370> the

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
the second and the slower you go the

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.080 
the second and the slower you go the
choppy<00:03:52.970> or<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.239> will<00:03:53.299> look<00:03:53.480> now<00:03:53.930> there<00:03:54.620> are

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
choppy or it will look now there are

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.759 
choppy or it will look now there are
plugins<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.569> can<00:03:56.750> purchase<00:03:56.959> one<00:03:57.470> being

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
plugins that you can purchase one being

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.830 
plugins that you can purchase one being
called<00:03:58.190> twixtor<00:03:58.819> which<00:03:59.030> basically<00:03:59.329> is<00:03:59.480> like<00:03:59.690> a

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
called twixtor which basically is like a

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.809 
called twixtor which basically is like a
two<00:04:00.049> hundred<00:04:00.170> fifty<00:04:00.410> dollars<00:04:00.799> software<00:04:01.310> that

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
two hundred fifty dollars software that

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.300 
two hundred fifty dollars software that
does<00:04:01.849> frame<00:04:02.660> blending<00:04:02.900> for<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.010> does

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
does frame blending for you and it does

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.000 
does frame blending for you and it does
it<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.849> perfectly<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:06.410> makes<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.829> look

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
it so perfectly that it makes it look

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.349 
it so perfectly that it makes it look
like<00:04:07.040> you're<00:04:07.340> shooting<00:04:07.670> at<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> thousand

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
like you're shooting at a thousand

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.300 
like you're shooting at a thousand
frames<00:04:08.569> per<00:04:08.870> second<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.380> science<00:04:09.769> behind<00:04:09.950> it

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
frames per second the science behind it

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.190 
frames per second the science behind it
is<00:04:10.489> frame<00:04:11.060> blending<00:04:11.239> what<00:04:11.569> it<00:04:11.690> does<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:12.139> it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
is frame blending what it does is it

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.840 
is frame blending what it does is it
just<00:04:12.560> kind<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:12.769> molds<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.430> two<00:04:13.609> shots

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
just kind of molds the two shots

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.300 
just kind of molds the two shots
together<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.510> fades<00:04:15.350> them<00:04:15.739> together<00:04:16.100> what

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
together it fades them together what

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.009 
together it fades them together what
twixtor<00:04:16.850> does<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.539> just<00:04:17.720> kind<00:04:17.959> of

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
twixtor does is it just kind of

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.349 
twixtor does is it just kind of
amplifies<00:04:18.950> that<00:04:19.220> process<00:04:19.789> which<00:04:20.000> basically

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
amplifies that process which basically

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.750 
amplifies that process which basically
between<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.440> two<00:04:21.590> frames<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.160> will<00:04:22.280> connect

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
between the two frames it will connect

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.330 
between the two frames it will connect
them<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.210> mold<00:04:23.450> them<00:04:23.539> together<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:24.979> you'll

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
them and mold them together so you'll

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.640 
them and mold them together so you'll
get<00:04:25.580> kind<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.090> thick<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.450> merge<00:04:26.870> shot<00:04:27.380> so

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
get kind of thick this merge shot so

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.460 
get kind of thick this merge shot so
your<00:04:27.919> eyes<00:04:28.160> will<00:04:28.550> think<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.060> it's<00:04:29.330> all<00:04:29.660> one

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
your eyes will think that it's all one

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.580 
your eyes will think that it's all one
tank<00:04:30.830> which<00:04:31.190> really<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:31.760> not<00:04:31.970> it's<00:04:32.270> just

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
tank which really it's not it's just

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.770 
tank which really it's not it's just
filling<00:04:33.590> in<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.860> gaps<00:04:34.130> with<00:04:34.340> tape<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.180> if<00:04:35.660> you

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
filling in the gaps with tape and if you

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.300 
filling in the gaps with tape and if you
want<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.020> see<00:04:36.139> that<00:04:36.289> process<00:04:36.710> kind<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:37.039> done

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
want to see that process kind of done

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.400 
want to see that process kind of done
there's<00:04:38.060> a<00:04:38.150> guy<00:04:38.270> who<00:04:38.330> does<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.690> with<00:04:38.810> photos

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.480 
you can work over there and basically he
makes<00:04:42.020> slow-motion<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:43.190> out<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.430> the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
makes slow-motion that out of the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.089 
makes slow-motion that out of the
footage<00:04:43.880> but<00:04:44.120> with<00:04:44.330> photography<00:04:45.169> really

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
you get some super slow-motion looks

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.370 
you get some super slow-motion looks
like<00:04:49.669> it's<00:04:49.820> shot<00:04:50.180> at<00:04:50.330> five<00:04:50.570> billion<00:04:50.930> frames
