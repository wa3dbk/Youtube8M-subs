royal<00:02:31.450> would<00:02:31.720> be<00:02:31.840> hard-pressed<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.590> cause<00:02:32.770> a

tremor or something similar

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.440 
tremor or something similar
so<00:02:35.260> why<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.500> tweets<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> calls<00:02:37.240> there

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
so why the tweets and the calls there

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.910 
so why the tweets and the calls there
was<00:02:37.600> definitely<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.670> shift<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.150> shake<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
was definitely a shift and a shake and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.010 
was definitely a shift and a shake and
it<00:02:41.920> seemed<00:02:42.220> exactly<00:02:42.610> like<00:02:43.030> an<00:02:43.209> earthquake<00:02:43.390> but

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
it seemed exactly like an earthquake but

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.690 
it seemed exactly like an earthquake but
it<00:02:44.170> wasn't<00:02:44.680> our<00:02:44.860> instruments<00:02:45.489> are<00:02:45.580> sensitive

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
it wasn't our instruments are sensitive

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.760 
it wasn't our instruments are sensitive
enough<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.900> chicken<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.380> picking<00:02:47.709> at

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
enough that if a chicken is picking at

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.020 
enough that if a chicken is picking at
the<00:02:47.860> ground<00:02:48.040> 20<00:02:48.340> feet<00:02:48.489> away<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.730> can<00:02:48.880> pick

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
the ground 20 feet away you can pick

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.910 
the ground 20 feet away you can pick
that<00:02:49.060> up<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.600> there<00:02:49.900> was<00:02:50.110> no<00:02:50.380> sign<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.739> a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
that up but there was no sign of a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.760 
that up but there was no sign of a

chicken or an earthquake and so just
