00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
our children ideally right and the idea

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.160 
our children ideally right and the idea
that<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:58.920> happening<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.820> hot

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
that that's happening really is hot

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.010 
that that's happening really is hot
here<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:00.560> see<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.720> couldn't<00:02:02.869> be

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
here and I see it it just couldn't be

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.929 
here and I see it it just couldn't be
done<00:02:03.049> without<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.890> financial<00:02:04.100> support<00:02:04.790> and

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
done without the financial support and

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.480 
done without the financial support and
it<00:02:05.659> makes<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.080> difference<00:02:06.439> it<00:02:06.740> really<00:02:07.159> makes<00:02:07.369> a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
it makes a difference it really makes a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.030 
it makes a difference it really makes a
difference<00:02:07.660> people's<00:02:08.660> lives<00:02:08.899> are<00:02:09.140> changing<00:02:09.530> I

definitely influences other youth coming
up<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:31.670> now<00:03:31.850> when<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.090> have<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.299> 19<00:03:32.780> or<00:03:32.870> 20<00:03:33.170> year

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
up so now when you have a 19 or 20 year

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.620 
up so now when you have a 19 or 20 year
old<00:03:33.380> youth<00:03:33.560> he<00:03:33.920> becomes<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.400> mentor<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:35.060> lot<00:03:35.510> of

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
old youth he becomes a mentor a lot of

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.210 
old youth he becomes a mentor a lot of
these<00:03:35.720> youth<00:03:35.959> they<00:03:36.140> don't<00:03:36.320> have<00:03:36.530> mentors<00:03:37.130> they

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
these youth they don't have mentors they

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.470 
these youth they don't have mentors they
don't<00:03:37.370> have<00:03:37.459> people<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:37.760> look<00:03:37.910> up<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.390> they

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
don't have people to look up to and they

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.390 
don't have people to look up to and they
don't<00:03:38.570> even<00:03:38.750> know<00:03:39.019> what<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.890> positive<00:03:40.220> side

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
don't even know what the positive side

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.780 
don't even know what the positive side
looks<00:03:40.640> like<00:03:41.290> youth<00:03:42.290> reach<00:03:42.560> delivers<00:03:43.069> service

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
looks like youth reach delivers service

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.449 
looks like youth reach delivers service
to<00:03:43.940> let<00:03:44.090> them<00:03:44.239> know<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.720> these<00:03:45.560> barriers<00:03:45.829> can

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
to let them know that these barriers can

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.050 
to let them know that these barriers can
be<00:03:46.549> overcome

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
be overcome

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.210 
be overcome
so<00:03:47.420> without<00:03:47.630> programs<00:03:48.170> like<00:03:48.319> this<00:03:48.530> without

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
so without programs like this without

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.309 
so without programs like this without
those<00:03:49.489> donors<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.209> don't<00:03:50.870> know<00:03:50.989> where<00:03:51.290> people
