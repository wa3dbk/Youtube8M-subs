00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.370
 Well, here we have the macbook 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.510
 pro retina already configured and with many 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.560
 installed programs 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.800
 there is everything that this law 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.270
 this we are going to close some tests of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.650
 speed 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.650
 to see how he reacts 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.970
 let's measure how long it takes to turn on 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.720
 with the 3 1 2 3 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.900
 in 14 seconds 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.290
 to then order the whole system 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.290
 operative 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.020
 the engineers know what programs 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.450
 as matlab will be eternities in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.610
 start let's see how long it takes here 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 on the macbook pro 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 1 2 3 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.930
 4 seconds 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.140
 that is awesome 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:38.770
 my laptop works with more than one minute 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 another program a little heavy on 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.979
 eclipse 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.440
 good 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.440
 seven seconds to involve you 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.530
 what makes this computer fast 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.270
 Well, there are several characteristics that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 they conjugate one because it is the processor 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.750
 third generation i7 processor 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.220
 and 7 quad-core airways 2.3 giga 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:23.460
 hertz turbo boost of 3.3 gigahertz has 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:28.340
 RAM memory ddr3 of 1600 megahertz 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.340
 configures it with 16 gigas of ram 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.489
 for several years 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.490
 and well what makes it fast in the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.070
 boot and all that then is the unit of 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.780
 solid state that you have instead of 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.620
 HDD 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.069
 flash memory which is much more 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.069
 quick that 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.490
 that a safe disk has not been taken 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.740
 measurements and it 's roughly four 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.750
 times faster than in reading and 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.360
 writing that a hard drive after 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.720
 we will make comparisons of the hard disk of 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.060
 a mac 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.580
 a macbook prokom 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.670
 with a hard drive and with this one with us 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.410
 well here we see this some 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.170
 characteristics I already mentioned 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.200
 let's see a little more 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.200
 view of 72.3 giga hertz four cores 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.730
 here is the cache memory then 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.660
 we talk about this let's see the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.210
 graphics 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.680
 it is this computer has two 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.590
 gpu graphics processors 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.569
 the processor 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.760
 Intel Mark This is in fact found 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:55.910
 inside the i7 processor as it says here 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.910
 this is 512 megabytes this is the 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.160
 processor that commonly uses this 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:07.569
 computer is a graphics processor 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:10.840
 Low consumption when you require 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.909
 power in graphic processing by 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.659
 example when you run video games or 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.659
 when you do 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.600
 and rendering 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.360
 or simulation 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.240
 in certain programs because the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.290
 second processed graphic that you 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.350
 nvidia geforce gt 660 m this has a 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.350
 giga bytes of memory 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.260
 and well, well 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.310
 by the screen that has we will talk about it 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.270
 on the screen requires some powerful 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.270
 for graphic flavors 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.900
 here it is 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.020
 solid state or flash 256 drive 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.830
 gigabytes and I have nothing more 160 gigs 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.830
 with everything that install 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.380
 16 gigabytes of ram ddr3 memory of 1600 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.380
 myers 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.730
 good in the next video we are going to 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.450
 talk about the retina screen on your 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.450
 resolution 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.719
 in what it affects or in what it benefits 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.770
 let's also talk about processor 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:32.689
 i7 and bridge over the state unit 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.029
 solid we are going to buy with a hard drive 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.790
 and we are going to talk about the 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:40.510
 ddr3 ram memory 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.510
 see you later
