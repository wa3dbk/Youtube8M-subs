here<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> US<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.480> major

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
here in the US now there are some major

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240 
here in the US now there are some major
differences<00:00:25.260> though<00:00:25.439> between<00:00:25.619> tornadoes

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
differences though between tornadoes

that occur in the northern hemisphere

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
that occur in the northern hemisphere
compared<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.349> those<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.680> happen<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.099> the

tornado<00:00:31.260> caught<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.800> tape<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.160> Tuesday

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
tornado caught on tape from Tuesday

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.729 
tornado caught on tape from Tuesday
we're<00:00:33.480> gonna<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.380> Tuscaloosa

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
we're gonna take you into the Tuscaloosa

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.110 
we're gonna take you into the Tuscaloosa
one<00:00:35.100> two<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.550> caught<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.730> tape<00:00:35.850> from

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
one two that was caught on tape from

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.330 
one two that was caught on tape from
last<00:00:36.270> Wednesday<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.050> look<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.739> some

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
last Wednesday and look at some

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
last Wednesday and look at some
differences<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.719> New<00:00:39.840> Zealand

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
differences so this is the New Zealand

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
differences so this is the New Zealand
one<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.920> you're<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> notice<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
one what you're going to notice is the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
one what you're going to notice is the
direction<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> debris<00:00:42.809> flying<00:00:43.200> around

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
direction of the debris flying around

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
direction of the debris flying around
it's<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:43.890> flying<00:00:44.399> around<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it's actually flying around in a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's actually flying around in a
clockwise<00:00:45.780> direction<00:00:46.520> now<00:00:47.520> typically<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
clockwise direction now typically in the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.650 
clockwise direction now typically in the
u.s.<00:00:49.219> 99%<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> time<00:00:50.730> tornadoes<00:00:51.449> will

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
u.s. 99% of the time tornadoes will

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
u.s. 99% of the time tornadoes will
actually<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.320> other<00:00:52.530> way<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:53.039> see

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
actually be the other way you will see

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
actually be the other way you will see
the<00:00:53.460> debris<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.940> around<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the debris going around in a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
the debris going around in a
counterclockwise<00:00:55.320> direction<00:00:55.770> such<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.820> what

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
counterclockwise direction such as what

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
counterclockwise direction such as what
we<00:00:57.059> saw<00:00:57.210> last<00:00:57.449> week<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.050> Tuscaloosa<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.010> we

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
we saw last week in Tuscaloosa that we

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.410 
we saw last week in Tuscaloosa that we
caught<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.430> tape<00:00:59.609> from<00:01:00.030> last<00:01:00.270> Wednesday

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
caught on tape from last Wednesday

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.819 
caught on tape from last Wednesday
here's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> look<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
here's a look at that you can see the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
here's a look at that you can see the
debris<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.640> case<00:01:02.910> again<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.870> around

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
debris in this case again going around

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830 
debris in this case again going around
in<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> counterclockwise<00:01:05.430> direction<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
in that counterclockwise direction this

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.109 
in that counterclockwise direction this
is<00:01:06.900> typical<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> US<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> Northern

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
is typical of the US and of the Northern

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.080 
is typical of the US and of the Northern
Hemisphere<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> southern<00:01:10.350> hemisphere

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090

99%<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> time<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:12.810> saw<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.320> New

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
99% of the time what they saw in New

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.109 
99% of the time what they saw in New
Zealand<00:01:13.470> yesterday<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.700> which

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
Zealand yesterday is what they get which

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
Zealand yesterday is what they get which
is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.570> tornado<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.439> rotate<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
is a tornado that will rotate in a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
is a tornado that will rotate in a
clockwise<00:01:17.790> direction<00:01:18.150> let's<00:01:18.810> talk<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:19.110> why

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
clockwise direction let's talk about why

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
clockwise direction let's talk about why
so<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> northern<00:01:20.580> hemisphere<00:01:20.670> we've

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so here in the northern hemisphere we've

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
so here in the northern hemisphere we've
got<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> jet<00:01:21.570> stream<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> flows<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.409> west

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
got the jet stream that flows from west

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
got the jet stream that flows from west
to<00:01:22.799> east<00:01:22.890> across<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.549> country<00:01:23.880> high<00:01:24.180> pressure

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
to east across the country high pressure

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
to east across the country high pressure
the<00:01:24.689> air<00:01:24.720> around<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.290> blows<00:01:25.500> clockwise<00:01:26.009> around

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the air around it blows clockwise around

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
the air around it blows clockwise around
low<00:01:26.460> pressure<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:27.090> counter<00:01:27.659> clockwise<00:01:27.960> it's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
low pressure it's counter clockwise it's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
low pressure it's counter clockwise it's
the<00:01:28.770> opposite<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.520> southern<00:01:29.759> hemisphere

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the opposite in the southern hemisphere

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.789 
the opposite in the southern hemisphere
the<00:01:30.360> jet<00:01:30.689> stream<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.079> goes<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.560> east

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the jet stream actually goes from east
