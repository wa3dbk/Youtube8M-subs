00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
then i guess the ones that I made with

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.289 
then i guess the ones that I made with
either<00:01:03.239> Zoe<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.080> video<00:01:04.409> did<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.339> come<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
either Zoe or video did not come up so

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.950 
either Zoe or video did not come up so
your<00:01:07.200> original<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.720> install<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.840> ROM

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
your original if you install this ROM

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.010 
your original if you install this ROM
after<00:01:10.970> you've<00:01:11.970> already<00:01:12.299> been<00:01:12.420> using<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.060 
guess it's not pulling them over to show
you<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.140> starts<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.860> turn
