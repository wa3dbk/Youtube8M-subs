talking<00:00:10.170> about<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.620> frame<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.309> I'd<00:00:11.490> like<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
talking about the frame but I'd like to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.009 
talking about the frame but I'd like to
talk<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.269> about<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.660> being<00:00:12.840> an

talk to you about it being an
experimental<00:00:13.620> liquor<00:00:14.219> car<00:00:14.540> what<00:00:15.540> we've<00:00:15.719> done

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
experimental liquor car what we've done

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.769 
experimental liquor car what we've done
here<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.650> built<00:00:16.949> all<00:00:17.490> these<00:00:17.760> cavities<00:00:18.390> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
here is we built all these cavities to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.849 
here is we built all these cavities to
place<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.439> batteries<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.850> frame<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.859> of

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
place the batteries in the frame and of

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.670 
place the batteries in the frame and of
course<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.119> being<00:00:24.330> an<00:00:24.510> experimental<00:00:25.199> car

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
course this being an experimental car

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.880 
course this being an experimental car
we're<00:00:26.609> trying<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.060> eliminate<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.170> front<00:00:28.590> end

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
we're trying to eliminate the front end

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.980 
we're trying to eliminate the front end
meaning<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> steering<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.449> rear<00:00:30.720> end

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
meaning the steering in the rear end

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
meaning the steering in the rear end
being<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.710> differential<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.149> take<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
being with differential if you take a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.520 
being with differential if you take a
look<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:34.140> our<00:00:35.040> prototype<00:00:35.850> model<00:00:36.530> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
look here at our prototype model you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.610 
look here at our prototype model you
kind<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.750> what<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.899> did<00:00:40.110> before<00:00:40.290> we

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
kind of see what we did before we

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.569 
kind of see what we did before we
started<00:00:40.890> building<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.579> car<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:43.190> we<00:00:44.190> put<00:00:44.430> all

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
started building this car is we put all

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.970 
started building this car is we put all
these<00:00:44.730> compartments<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.440> similar

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
these compartments in here very similar

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
these compartments in here very similar
to<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> frame<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.820> looking<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.390> here

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to the frame that you looking in here

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.799 
to the frame that you looking in here
here<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.430> four<00:00:50.760> wheels<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.510> you're

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
here are the four wheels and you're

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.930 
here are the four wheels and you're
starting<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> four<00:00:52.949> wheels<00:00:53.219> show<00:00:53.670> up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
starting to see the four wheels show up

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.930 
starting to see the four wheels show up
here<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.559> take<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> closer<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.430> you'll

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
here if you take a closer look you'll

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.010 
here if you take a closer look you'll
see<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> frame<00:00:57.629> member<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.910> here<00:01:00.020> which

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
see the frame member here and here which

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.770 
see the frame member here and here which
again<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.890> exactly<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.120> frame<00:01:03.359> member

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
again is exactly like the frame member

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.520 
again is exactly like the frame member
here<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> here

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
here and here and here and here

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.420 
here and here and here and here
eventually<00:01:07.530> we're<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> build<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
eventually we're going to build up this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.480 
eventually we're going to build up this
wall<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.330> wall<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> framing<00:01:10.830> system

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
wall in this wall of the framing system

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.560 
wall in this wall of the framing system
but<00:01:12.450> also<00:01:13.220> I'd<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.520> show<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.790> where

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
but also I'd like to show you where

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.130 
but also I'd like to show you where
these<00:01:15.810> batteries<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.040> front<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
these batteries are the front of you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.179 
these batteries are the front of you
these<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.670> simulated<00:01:20.670> batteries<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.509> also

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
these are simulated batteries here also

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
these are simulated batteries here also
the<00:01:23.189> batteries<00:01:23.610> go<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the batteries go all the way up and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.090 
the batteries go all the way up and
underneath<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.860> seat<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:27.560> like<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:28.890> we're

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
underneath the seat and like I say we're

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.600 
underneath the seat and like I say we're
slowly<00:01:29.430> building<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.360> car<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.430> can

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
take a look underneath the car like a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.729 
take a look underneath the car like a
quick<00:02:29.620> showing<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.550> here<00:02:31.650> you'll<00:02:32.650> see

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
quick showing you here you'll see

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.010 
quick showing you here you'll see
underneath<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.400> car<00:02:33.640> how<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.270> wheels<00:02:34.720> are

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
underneath the car how the wheels are

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.050 
underneath the car how the wheels are
spread<00:02:35.380> out<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.800> four<00:02:36.010> corners<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.850> they

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
spread out in the four corners like they

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.030 
spread out in the four corners like they
are<00:02:37.180> spread<00:02:37.690> out<00:02:37.720> here<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.470> these<00:02:38.680> four

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
are spread out here in these four

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.260 
are spread out here in these four
corners<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.400> what<00:02:42.400> we're<00:02:42.580> trying<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.000> do<00:02:43.239> of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
corners so what we're trying to do of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.310 
corners so what we're trying to do of
course<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.820> see<00:02:46.060> how<00:02:46.300> many<00:02:46.510> bad<00:02:46.720> ways<00:02:46.989> we<00:02:47.170> can

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
course to see how many bad ways we can

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.940 
course to see how many bad ways we can
hide<00:02:47.560> underneath<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.190> frame<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:49.950> placing

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
hide underneath the frame and placing

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.630 
hide underneath the frame and placing
the<00:02:51.220> wheels<00:02:51.489> in<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.110> farthest<00:02:53.110> possible

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
the wheels in the farthest possible

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.800 
the wheels in the farthest possible
corners<00:02:54.640> gives<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.510> car<00:02:56.220> huge<00:02:57.810> stability

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
corners gives this car huge stability

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.280 
corners gives this car huge stability
and<00:02:59.760> I'd<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:00.970> point<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> car

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
and I'd like to point to you in the car

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.690 
and I'd like to point to you in the car
behind<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:03.190> over<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.910> run<00:03:04.299> that<00:03:04.600> one

behind you over there and run that one
behind<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.880> here<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:07.420> car

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.130 

very<00:03:19.140> similar<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.680> what<00:03:20.010> we<00:03:20.160> have<00:03:20.340> here<00:03:20.640> again

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
very similar to what we have here again

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
if you take a close look at the car you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.520 
if you take a close look at the car you
can<00:03:25.620> see<00:03:25.890> inside<00:03:26.460> here<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.240> same<00:03:27.600> heavy

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
can see inside here is that same heavy

heavy frame all the way around and if
you<00:03:31.710> take<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.890> look<00:03:32.040> at<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> bottom<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> car

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
you take a look at the bottom of the car

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.260 
you take a look at the bottom of the car
you<00:03:33.510> see<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> flat<00:03:34.110> steel<00:03:34.470> bottom<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:36.090> you'll

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
you see a flat steel bottom but you'll

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.690 
you see a flat steel bottom but you'll
also<00:03:36.510> see<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.080> wheels<00:03:37.320> are<00:03:37.650> pushed<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.550> the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
also see the wheels are pushed to the

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.850 
also see the wheels are pushed to the
coroner's<00:03:39.210> as<00:03:39.390> far<00:03:39.780> as<00:03:39.930> they<00:03:40.050> possibly<00:03:40.080> can

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
very similar to this car here we built

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.510 
very similar to this car here we built
several<00:03:44.310> model<00:03:45.060> cars<00:03:45.330> before<00:03:46.340> we<00:03:47.340> actually

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
several model cars before we actually

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.090 
several model cars before we actually
built<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.210> big<00:03:48.510> big<00:03:48.750> car<00:03:49.050> here<00:03:49.350> let<00:03:49.950> me<00:03:50.070> show

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.280 
you a couple of one model cars this
particular<00:03:54.450> car<00:03:55.020> is<00:03:55.700> Plexiglas<00:03:56.700> and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
particular car is Plexiglas and

particular car is Plexiglas and
styrofoam<00:03:58.290> with<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.130> plywood<00:03:59.520> bottom<00:04:00.330> we<00:04:01.140> have

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
styrofoam with a plywood bottom we have

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.000 
styrofoam with a plywood bottom we have
this<00:04:01.500> running<00:04:01.800> at<00:04:02.100> one<00:04:02.310> time<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.750> then<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.830> use

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
this running at one time and then we use

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.640 
this running at one time and then we use
that<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.400> progress<00:04:05.850> into<00:04:06.240> other<00:04:06.660> cars<00:04:07.020> if<00:04:07.410> you

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
that to progress into other cars if you

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.590 
that to progress into other cars if you
take<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.860> look<00:04:07.980> again<00:04:08.250> you'll<00:04:08.970> see<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.270> very

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
take a look again you'll see that very

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.740 
take a look again you'll see that very
heavy<00:04:10.110> steel<00:04:11.040> frame<00:04:11.670> all<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.270> way<00:04:12.330> around<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
heavy steel frame all the way around the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
type of a side-impact this is the first

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.560 
type of a side-impact this is the first
scale<00:04:21.420> model<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.080> we<00:04:22.200> built<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:24.210> difference

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
scale model that we built the difference

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.330 
scale model that we built the difference
is<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.110> difference<00:04:25.470> in<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.650> heights<00:04:25.950> here<00:04:26.220> it

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
is the difference in the heights here it

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.340 
is the difference in the heights here it
didn't<00:04:26.670> fit<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.000> batteries<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.840> then<00:04:28.080> this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
didn't fit the batteries and then this

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.980 
didn't fit the batteries and then this
one<00:04:28.410> has<00:04:28.770> titanium<00:04:29.280> steel<00:04:30.030> wheels<00:04:30.480> underneath

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
one has titanium steel wheels underneath

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.070 
one has titanium steel wheels underneath
it<00:04:31.490> but<00:04:32.490> still<00:04:32.820> doing<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.420> same<00:04:33.660> thing<00:04:36.080> I'm

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
it but still doing the same thing I'm

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
Greg zanis I wanted to talk to you a

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.730 
Greg zanis I wanted to talk to you a
little<00:04:39.090> bit<00:04:39.180> about<00:04:39.630> why<00:04:40.140> this<00:04:40.200> is<00:04:40.620> an

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
little bit about why this is an

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.620 
little bit about why this is an
experimental<00:04:41.340> card<00:04:41.760> nobody's<00:04:42.150> ever<00:04:42.300> built

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.600 
experimental card nobody's ever built
anything<00:04:42.870> quite<00:04:43.380> like<00:04:43.410> this<00:04:43.650> before<00:04:43.920> and

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
anything quite like this before and
