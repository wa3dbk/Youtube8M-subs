00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.769

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.939
 my dear the importance of a week 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 I know it's because of mismanagement 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.260
 and since then 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 yes, well yes 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.640
 a bullshit 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 has always 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 in this stage needing more than 1 100 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 you know what i think 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.460
 mardy fish n was a feeling of insecurity 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.300
 What would you say? 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 the next day but if it was 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.629

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.119
 This is what I called 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.119
 but the traffic 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.299
 thumb in this round 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.499
 I can not accept 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:04.769
