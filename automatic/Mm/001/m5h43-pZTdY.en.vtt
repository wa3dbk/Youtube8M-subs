one<00:04:17.510> you've<00:04:17.630> got<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.780> very<00:04:18.110> firm<00:04:18.590> suspension

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:19.490

and of course rather good payload and
towing<00:04:23.440> capacity<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.680> does<00:04:25.190> mean<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.430> on

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
towing capacity it does mean that on

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.140 
towing capacity it does mean that on
very<00:04:26.270> undulating<00:04:27.200> or<00:04:27.650> bad<00:04:27.920> pavement<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.640> feel
