00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
you guys are gonna have to bear with me

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.150 
you guys are gonna have to bear with me
it<00:00:09.040> is<00:00:09.340> freezing<00:00:09.969> I<00:00:10.510> think<00:00:10.750> my<00:00:10.900> lens<00:00:11.440> is<00:00:11.799> kind

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
it is freezing I think my lens is kind

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.830 
it is freezing I think my lens is kind
of<00:00:12.219> fogging<00:00:12.520> up<00:00:12.820> and<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.180> Sun<00:00:13.510> is<00:00:13.809> just

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
of fogging up and the Sun is just

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.859 
of fogging up and the Sun is just
starting<00:00:14.260> to<00:00:14.709> peak<00:00:15.039> over<00:00:15.670> that<00:00:16.390> huge<00:00:16.810> tree

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
starting to peak over that huge tree

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.130 
starting to peak over that huge tree
that's<00:00:17.410> blocking<00:00:17.650> it<00:00:18.160> so<00:00:18.660> I'll<00:00:19.660> try<00:00:19.930> to<00:00:19.990> go

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
that's blocking it so I'll try to go

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.930 
that's blocking it so I'll try to go
through<00:00:20.350> this<00:00:20.470> really<00:00:20.710> quickly<00:00:21.040> so<00:00:21.580> the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
through this really quickly so the

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.110 
through this really quickly so the
details<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:22.600> this<00:00:22.840> pattern<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.740> it's<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.700> Dolman

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
details of this pattern is it's a Dolman

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.630 
details of this pattern is it's a Dolman
sleeve<00:00:25.450> so<00:00:25.870> this<00:00:26.050> is<00:00:26.170> all<00:00:26.530> in<00:00:26.800> one<00:00:27.100> sleeve

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
sleeve so this is all in one sleeve

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.960 
sleeve so this is all in one sleeve
right<00:00:27.940> here<00:00:28.300> this<00:00:28.510> is<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.720> 3/4<00:00:29.470> length<00:00:29.970> there

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
right here this is the 3/4 length there

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.510 
right here this is the 3/4 length there
this<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.450> a<00:00:31.480> loop<00:00:31.780> and<00:00:32.079> I<00:00:32.890> know<00:00:33.010> what<00:00:33.280> some<00:00:33.489> of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
this is a loop and I know what some of

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.910 
this is a loop and I know what some of
your<00:00:33.760> thinking<00:00:34.030> well<00:00:34.840> I<00:00:34.870> really<00:00:35.379> can't<00:00:35.649> see

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
your thinking well I really can't see

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.940 
your thinking well I really can't see
the<00:00:36.460> design<00:00:36.910> detail<00:00:37.450> yeah<00:00:38.200> I<00:00:38.440> could<00:00:38.650> have<00:00:38.770> done

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
the design detail yeah I could have done

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.229 
the design detail yeah I could have done
it<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.280> like<00:00:39.579> a<00:00:39.640> black<00:00:40.350> ity<00:00:41.350> but<00:00:41.890> for<00:00:42.700> me<00:00:42.910> I

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
it in like a black ity but for me I

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.080 
it in like a black ity but for me I
wanted<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.710> just<00:00:44.739> give<00:00:45.280> me<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.610> effect<00:00:45.910> of

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
wanted it to just give me the effect of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.569 
wanted it to just give me the effect of
the<00:00:46.210> draping<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.840> not<00:00:47.020> really<00:00:47.380> show<00:00:47.710> up<00:00:47.950> that

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
the draping and not really show up that

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.270 
the draping and not really show up that
design<00:00:49.180> detail<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.510> section<00:00:53.440> here<00:00:53.829> is<00:00:53.980> in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
design detail this section here is in

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.729 
design detail this section here is in
two<00:00:54.520> parts<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.420> there's<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.750> purse<00:00:56.140> seaming

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
two parts so there's a purse seaming

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.920 
two parts so there's a purse seaming
here<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:57.100> give<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.570> shaping<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.809> then

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
here to give it that shaping and then

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.260 
here to give it that shaping and then
the<00:00:59.079> loop<00:00:59.320> is<00:00:59.559> made<00:01:00.450> by<00:01:03.600> inserting<00:01:04.600> into<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
the loop is made by inserting into this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.569 
the loop is made by inserting into this
I<00:01:07.719> think<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.380> fabric<00:01:08.590> what<00:01:08.920> happens<00:01:09.219> here<00:01:09.490> is

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
I think the fabric what happens here is

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.569 
I think the fabric what happens here is
that<00:01:09.609> the<00:01:09.850> fabric<00:01:10.119> is<00:01:10.920> turned<00:01:11.920> down<00:01:12.100> and

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
that the fabric is turned down and

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.090 
that the fabric is turned down and
stitched<00:01:13.569> right<00:01:14.350> here<00:01:14.859> before<00:01:15.850> these<00:01:16.119> two<00:01:16.509> are

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
stitched right here before these two are

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.459 
stitched right here before these two are
joined<00:01:18.100> together<00:01:18.369> so<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.179> you're<00:01:19.359> able<00:01:19.539> to

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
joined together so that you're able to

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.039 
joined together so that you're able to
get<00:01:20.709> like<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.189> kind<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.579> eyelet<00:01:22.090> effect<00:01:22.810> to

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
get like this kind of eyelet effect to

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.459 
get like this kind of eyelet effect to
run<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:24.009> loop<00:01:25.499> it's<00:01:26.499> very<00:01:26.859> simple<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.899> they

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
run that loop it's very simple and they

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.230 
run that loop it's very simple and they
seem<00:01:29.770> like<00:01:29.979> it's<00:01:30.159> hard<00:01:30.369> but<00:01:30.579> it<00:01:30.729> is<00:01:30.850> very

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
seem like it's hard but it is very

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.050 
seem like it's hard but it is very
simple<00:01:31.869> now<00:01:32.469> for<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:33.189> neckline<00:01:33.609> and<00:01:33.789> neckline

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
simple now for the neckline and neckline

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.569 
simple now for the neckline and neckline
is<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.299> rollover<00:01:34.689> neckline<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.679> pattern<00:01:36.249> does

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
is a rollover neckline the pattern does

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.319 
is a rollover neckline the pattern does
not<00:01:36.880> say<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.749> add<00:01:38.289> any<00:01:38.740> stability<00:01:39.099> however<00:01:39.909> I

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
not say to add any stability however I

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.940 
not say to add any stability however I
did<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.929> I'll<00:01:41.049> show<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.319> what<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:41.740> looks

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
did and I'll show you what that looks

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.850 
did and I'll show you what that looks
like<00:01:42.039> right<00:01:42.340> here

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:00.170 

I<00:01:54.030> uses<00:01:55.030> some<00:01:56.430> Nets<00:01:58.290> fusible<00:01:59.290> interfacing

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
I uses some Nets fusible interfacing

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.610 
I uses some Nets fusible interfacing
this<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.480> my<00:02:01.900> fourth<00:02:03.210> version<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:05.290> top

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
this is my fourth version of this top

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.980 
this is my fourth version of this top
because<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.400> absolutely<00:02:06.790> love<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.420> every<00:02:07.810> year

because I absolutely love it every year

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.960 
because I absolutely love it every year
since<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.350> pattern<00:02:08.530> came<00:02:08.920> out<00:02:09.130> I've<00:02:09.399> made<00:02:09.790> it

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
since the pattern came out I've made it

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.770 
since the pattern came out I've made it
it's<00:02:10.260> it's<00:02:11.260> great<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.340> wonderful<00:02:12.820> from<00:02:13.570> an

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it's it's great it's wonderful from an

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's it's great it's wonderful from an
ity<00:02:14.410> fabric<00:02:15.100> which<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.550> what<00:02:16.330> you're<00:02:16.510> seeing

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
ity fabric which I what you're seeing

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.949 
ity fabric which I what you're seeing
right<00:02:16.810> here<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.740> ity<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> sweater

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
right here this is a ity to a sweater

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.960 
right here this is a ity to a sweater
net<00:02:20.440> which<00:02:20.680> I've<00:02:20.830> also<00:02:21.010> made<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.520> out<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.820> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
net which I've also made it out of a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.660 
net which I've also made it out of a
heavier<00:02:22.330> sweater<00:02:22.720> net<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.230> works<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:24.130> all<00:02:24.459> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
heavier sweater net it works for all of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.720 
heavier sweater net it works for all of
that<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.020> did<00:02:26.350> find<00:02:26.709> that<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.550> you're

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
that but I did find that when you're

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.020 
that but I did find that when you're
using<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.180> lighter<00:02:28.420> fabric<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.200> ity

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
using a lighter fabric like that ity

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.090 
using a lighter fabric like that ity
it's<00:02:31.030> nice<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.570> have<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.989> stability<00:02:32.260> here<00:02:32.890> so

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
it's nice to have that stability here so

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.570 
it's nice to have that stability here so
when<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.280> turn<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.120> over<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:35.050> lays

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
when you turn it over it just lays

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.680 
when you turn it over it just lays
really<00:02:36.580> nice<00:02:38.040> yeah<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.940> that's<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.239> seam<00:02:40.480> right

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
really nice yeah and that's a seam right

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.790 
really nice yeah and that's a seam right
here<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.310> back<00:02:44.220> pretty<00:02:45.220> simple<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:47.650> know

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
here now to back pretty simple you know

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.880 
here now to back pretty simple you know
there's<00:02:48.010> really<00:02:48.220> nothing<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.989> has<00:02:50.590> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
there's really nothing to it it has a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.770 
there's really nothing to it it has a
center<00:02:51.640> back<00:02:51.880> seam<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:54.340> could<00:02:54.580> choose<00:02:54.910> if<00:02:55.269> you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
center back seam you could choose if you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.190 
center back seam you could choose if you
want<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.440> eliminate<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:58.900> loved

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
want to eliminate that but I just loved

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.560 
want to eliminate that but I just loved
it<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.880> that's<00:03:01.180> pretty<00:03:02.110> much<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:04.480> I

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
it and that's pretty much it so so I

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.410 
it and that's pretty much it so so I
recommend<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.350> pattern<00:03:06.150> absolutely<00:03:07.150> as<00:03:07.299> I

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
recommend this pattern absolutely as I

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.210 
recommend this pattern absolutely as I
said<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.959> number<00:03:08.140> four<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.950> probably

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
said this is number four and I probably

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.190 
said this is number four and I probably
will<00:03:09.730> make<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.150> again<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.920> think<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:13.209> you

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
will make it again I think that you

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.380 
will make it again I think that you
should<00:03:14.500> get<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.580> one<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:15.970> if<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.209> don't

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
should get this one and if you don't

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.330 
should get this one and if you don't
have<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.750> because<00:03:17.049> it's<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.830> struggle<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.310> find

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
have it because it's a struggle to find

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.729 
have it because it's a struggle to find
patterns<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.209> can<00:03:19.239> use<00:03:19.540> sweater<00:03:20.470> knits

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
patterns that you can use sweater knits

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.560 
patterns that you can use sweater knits
for<00:03:20.950> especially<00:03:21.340> if<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.670> live<00:03:21.820> in<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.090> colder

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
for especially if you live in a colder

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.350 
for especially if you live in a colder
part<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.350> US<00:03:23.799> or<00:03:24.160> wherever<00:03:24.220> you're<00:03:25.000> at<00:03:25.030> in

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
part of the US or wherever you're at in

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.050 
part of the US or wherever you're at in
the<00:03:25.390> world<00:03:25.720> for<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.170> cooler<00:03:26.410> months<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.880> this

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
the world for the cooler months and this

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.930 
the world for the cooler months and this
is<00:03:28.120> one<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:29.140> could<00:03:29.709> work<00:03:29.920> for<00:03:30.220> both<00:03:30.459> summer

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
is one that could work for both summer

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.500 
is one that could work for both summer
and<00:03:31.090> winter<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.500> as<00:03:32.769> promised<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.700> will<00:03:34.030> show
