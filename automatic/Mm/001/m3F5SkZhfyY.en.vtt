one of the main principles of sports
psychology<00:00:04.540> is<00:00:04.990> the<00:00:05.259> idea<00:00:05.529> of<00:00:05.740> focusing<00:00:05.980> on

psychology is the idea of focusing on

psychology is the idea of focusing on
the<00:00:06.430> process<00:00:06.940> and<00:00:07.180> not<00:00:07.270> the<00:00:07.330> outcome<00:00:07.509> in

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
the process and not the outcome in

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.140 
the process and not the outcome in
reality<00:00:08.769> we<00:00:09.309> have<00:00:09.340> no<00:00:09.550> control<00:00:09.880> over<00:00:09.910> the

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
reality we have no control over the

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.030 
reality we have no control over the
result<00:00:10.510> when<00:00:11.170> we<00:00:11.230> have<00:00:11.349> control<00:00:11.590> over<00:00:11.650> is<00:00:11.920> the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
result when we have control over is the

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.190 
result when we have control over is the
process<00:00:12.550> what's<00:00:13.090> the<00:00:13.210> process<00:00:13.450> I'm<00:00:13.780> doing<00:00:14.080> and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
process what's the process I'm doing and

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.419 
process what's the process I'm doing and
how<00:00:14.259> can<00:00:14.320> I<00:00:14.469> improve<00:00:14.559> that<00:00:14.769> because<00:00:15.219> if<00:00:15.340> I

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
how can I improve that because if I

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:23.910 
how can I improve that because if I
improve<00:00:15.639> that<00:00:15.910> then<00:00:16.569> my<00:00:16.720> results<00:00:17.079> will<00:00:17.199> change

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.599 

if<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.070> think<00:00:25.250> about<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:25.550> ancient<00:00:25.789> samurai

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.010 

how<00:00:30.609> did<00:00:30.759> they<00:00:30.820> go<00:00:30.939> into<00:00:31.150> battle<00:00:31.300> they<00:00:31.720> went<00:00:31.900> in

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
how did they go into battle they went in

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.410 
how did they go into battle they went in
being<00:00:32.619> okay<00:00:32.860> with<00:00:32.890> death<00:00:33.220> they<00:00:34.059> went<00:00:34.239> in<00:00:34.300> okay

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
being okay with death they went in okay

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.319 
being okay with death they went in okay
to<00:00:35.020> essentially<00:00:35.800> lose<00:00:36.100> at<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.760> same<00:00:37.030> time

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
to essentially lose at the same time

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.330 
to essentially lose at the same time
they<00:00:37.930> were<00:00:37.989> out<00:00:38.350> there<00:00:38.559> to<00:00:38.829> fight<00:00:39.610> viciously<00:00:40.000> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
they were out there to fight viciously I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.889 
they were out there to fight viciously I
think<00:00:42.340> of<00:00:42.430> that<00:00:42.579> with<00:00:42.730> athletes<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.600> have<00:00:43.750> to

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
think of that with athletes you have to

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.110 
think of that with athletes you have to
be<00:00:43.989> okay<00:00:44.350> with<00:00:44.379> losing<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.100> failing<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.670> be

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
be okay with losing and failing and be

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.470 
be okay with losing and failing and be
in<00:00:46.330> it<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.660> hundred<00:00:47.110> percent<00:00:47.199> I<00:00:48.239> work<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.329> lot

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
in it a hundred percent I work a lot

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.299 
in it a hundred percent I work a lot
with<00:00:49.660> traders<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.440> if<00:00:50.500> I'm<00:00:50.620> applying<00:00:50.800> samurai

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
with traders so if I'm applying samurai

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.950 
with traders so if I'm applying samurai
mind<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.730> something<00:00:52.300> like<00:00:52.420> trading<00:00:52.690> what<00:00:52.870> I'm

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
mind to something like trading what I'm

first of all doing is saying am i
letting<00:00:55.510> my<00:00:55.720> emotions<00:00:56.290> dictate<00:00:57.220> my

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
letting my emotions dictate my

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.759 
letting my emotions dictate my
decision-making<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.659> reactions<00:00:59.230> I<00:00:59.470> help

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
decision-making and reactions I help

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.049 
decision-making and reactions I help
people<00:00:59.860> to<00:01:00.010> get<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:00.339> in<00:01:00.489> line<00:01:00.609> and<00:01:00.850> say<00:01:00.940> we

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
people to get that in line and say we

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.320 
people to get that in line and say we
got<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.270> think<00:01:01.390> like<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.539> samurai<00:01:01.899> here

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
got to think like a samurai here

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.010 
got to think like a samurai here
samurai<00:01:04.330> didn't<00:01:04.570> let<00:01:04.780> their<00:01:04.899> emotions

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
samurai didn't let their emotions

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.430 
samurai didn't let their emotions
dictate<00:01:05.410> things<00:01:06.570> how<00:01:07.570> much<00:01:07.869> are<00:01:08.170> they

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
dictate things how much are they

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.249 
dictate things how much are they
reacting<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:10.119> things<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:10.690> went<00:01:10.930> wrong

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
reacting to things that went wrong

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.169 
reacting to things that went wrong
because<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:12.250> fluctuations<00:01:12.940> in<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.149> market

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
because of fluctuations in the market

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.419 
because of fluctuations in the market
versus<00:01:13.929> a<00:01:13.960> bad<00:01:14.229> decision<00:01:14.649> on<00:01:14.890> their<00:01:15.009> part

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
versus a bad decision on their part

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:16.859 
versus a bad decision on their part
maybe<00:01:15.550> I'm<00:01:15.700> not<00:01:15.850> focusing<00:01:16.509> enough<00:01:16.750> on

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
maybe I'm not focusing enough on

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.359 
maybe I'm not focusing enough on
managing<00:01:17.289> my<00:01:17.380> personnel<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.039> way<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.160> need

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
managing my personnel in the way I need

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.800 
managing my personnel in the way I need
to<00:01:18.460> manage<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:18.910> maybe<00:01:19.210> I'm<00:01:19.390> not<00:01:19.539> actually

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
to manage it maybe I'm not actually

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.200 
to manage it maybe I'm not actually
forcing<00:01:20.470> myself<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:21.070> have<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.399> routine<00:01:21.850> in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
forcing myself to have a routine in

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.810 
forcing myself to have a routine in
which<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.929> break<00:01:23.410> things<00:01:23.679> down<00:01:23.770> slow<00:01:24.340> down<00:01:24.550> take

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
which I break things down slow down take

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.730 
which I break things down slow down take
a<00:01:24.880> breath<00:01:24.970> before<00:01:25.330> I<00:01:25.539> decide<00:01:25.929> and<00:01:26.259> then<00:01:26.530> make<00:01:26.710> a

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
a breath before I decide and then make a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.630 
a breath before I decide and then make a
decision<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:29.110> all<00:01:29.229> function<00:01:30.130> better<00:01:30.310> through

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
decision we all function better through

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.420 
decision we all function better through
stories<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.300> through<00:01:31.960> images<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.250> if<00:01:33.340> I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
stories and through images and so if I

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.130 
stories and through images and so if I
say<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.670> someone<00:01:34.030> listen<00:01:34.390> picture<00:01:34.810> yourself

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140
