00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.820 
imperfection so that's their motto I
already<00:02:54.490> saw<00:02:54.850> three<00:02:55.150> times<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.990> this<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.800> a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
already saw three times and this is a

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.890 
already saw three times and this is a
cleaning<00:02:57.370> cloth<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.790> guess<00:02:58.600> it's<00:02:58.780> not

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
cleaning cloth I guess it's not

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.590 
cleaning cloth I guess it's not
microfiber<00:02:59.380> because<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.820> feels<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.300> little<00:03:01.390> bit

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
microfiber because it feels a little bit

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.570 
microfiber because it feels a little bit
different<00:03:01.990> than<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:03.100> still<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.550> a

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
different than that but still it is a

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.970 
different than that but still it is a
nice<00:03:03.970> clean<00:03:04.360> cloth<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.690> clean<00:03:04.870> your<00:03:05.200> laptop

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
other things in the book I guess that's

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.920
