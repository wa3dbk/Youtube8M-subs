 She went to the site the next question as 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.000
 the church belongs to the literary genre 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.160
 fantasy 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.990
 sinful writing of books which 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.869
 narrate about non-existent worlds and 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.390
 there are no creatures and there wasnâ€™t that if 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.699
 books want people to be kind to 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.880
 For example, our Nikolai raw rice or this 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.029
 novels and the world lord of the rings Tolkiens 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.930
 I have repeatedly said that the church 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.730
 on this occasion, well, does not say there is 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.720
 different fiction writers plus there 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.790
 storytellers are different who are all this 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.880
 come up with write and every writer 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.600
 he contributes some idea to his contempt 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.800
 and now this idea she can be either 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.700
 good to either 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.860
 bad and, respectively, if Tolkien 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.490
 wrote his novel before along with lewis they 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.680
 engaged in order as they say 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.800
 people turn to Christianity in its 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.330
 his century actually gave this to lewis 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.810
 turned out to be more 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.760
 right there as they say very well not 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.920
 quite call veiled thin on 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.170
 got completely veiled and when 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.060
 let's say it was screening before screening 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.820
 has shown that Tolkien is generally Christian 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.150
 said nothing as Lewis's film adaptation 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.670
 she could not otherwise film 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.190
 his novels why because well here they are 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.159
 talk about christ but they talk about him and 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.229
 nothing already there you hide everything goes 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.750
 plaintext well though of course all 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.700
 still depends on the artist so the church 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.500
 Fana is positive about how a writer 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.630
 which novels write some 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 works to people 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.870
 call for good camera order to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.340
 wisdom in the virtues of morality 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.340
 it is welcome
