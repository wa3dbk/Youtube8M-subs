let's<00:00:49.070> start<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> built<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.670> design<00:00:51.000> just

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
let's start with a built in design just

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.840 
let's start with a built in design just
like<00:00:52.079> Samsung<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:52.739> its<00:00:52.890> plastic<00:00:53.399> Sony's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
like Samsung with its plastic Sony's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.000 
like Samsung with its plastic Sony's
standing<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.390> its<00:00:54.570> Omni<00:00:54.840> balanced<00:00:55.170> metal<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
standing by its Omni balanced metal and

standing by its Omni balanced metal and
glass<00:00:56.129> design<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.600> difference<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
glass design the difference is that the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
glass design the difference is that the
only<00:00:58.829> balanced<00:00:59.129> design<00:00:59.309> spent<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.090> received

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
only balanced design spent well received

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.349 
only balanced design spent well received
and<00:01:00.690> we're<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.079> happy<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.980> back
