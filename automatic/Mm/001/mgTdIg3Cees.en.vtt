00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000
 with regard to circulation in

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.760
 are certified mineral waters with 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.590
 a low mineral content 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.599
 It is also interesting to take 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.920
 other liquids that can be added to the 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.280
