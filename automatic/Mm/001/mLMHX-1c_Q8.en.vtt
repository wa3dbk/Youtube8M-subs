00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
any float in the powder and it's not so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.189 
any float in the powder and it's not so
wide<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.480> you're<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.720> gonna<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.990> able<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
wide that you're not gonna be able to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.230 
carve on the groomers so I actually ride
about<00:00:22.710> an<00:00:22.949> 85<00:00:23.220> waist<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.880> kind<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.210> go-to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
about an 85 waist it's kind of my go-to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.240 
about an 85 waist it's kind of my go-to
ski<00:00:25.019> when<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.650> sure<00:00:25.920> where<00:00:26.099> I'm

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
ski when I'm not really sure where I'm

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.380 
ski when I'm not really sure where I'm
gonna<00:00:26.400> ski<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> conditions<00:00:27.330> are

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
gonna ski or what the conditions are

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
gonna ski or what the conditions are
gonna<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.590> ski<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.800> pretty

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
gonna be because this ski can pretty

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.910 
gonna be because this ski can pretty
much<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:30.199> this<00:00:31.199> ski<00:00:31.410> has<00:00:31.650> what's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
much do it all this ski has what's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.770 
much do it all this ski has what's
called<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.189> directional<00:00:32.820> flex<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.480> means

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
called a directional flex which means

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
called a directional flex which means
that<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.649> flex<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:35.670> different

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that the flex is a little bit different

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.270 
that the flex is a little bit different
in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> tip<00:00:36.660> than<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> tail<00:00:37.559> so

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
in the tip than it is in the tail so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
in the tip than it is in the tail so
true<00:00:38.910> Park<00:00:39.300> skis<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:40.079> feel<00:00:40.290> exactly<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
true Park skis will feel exactly the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
true Park skis will feel exactly the
same<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.489> ridden<00:00:41.790> forward<00:00:42.210> versus<00:00:42.570> backward

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
same when ridden forward versus backward

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
same when ridden forward versus backward
these<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.920> different<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
these are a little bit different and the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.360 
these are a little bit different and the
reason<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
reason that they do that is so that it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.400 
reason that they do that is so that it
makes<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> easier<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> turn<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.230> more

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
makes it easier to turn and a lot more

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.560 
makes it easier to turn and a lot more
stable<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:50.039> speed<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.030> you'd<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.420> play

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
stable at speed so if you'd like to play

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.360 
stable at speed so if you'd like to play
around<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> park<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.739> celebrity<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
around in the park the celebrity is a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.950 
around in the park the celebrity is a
twin<00:00:53.730> tip<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.840> great

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
twin tip you can see it so it's great

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.630 
twin tip you can see it so it's great
there<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
there but you also get a lot of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
there but you also get a lot of
performance<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> frontside<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.870> well<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
performance on the frontside as well the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
performance on the frontside as well the
tip<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.160> softer<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.180> got

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
tip is a little bit softer and it's got

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
tip is a little bit softer and it's got
an<00:01:00.449> early<00:01:00.809> riser<00:01:00.989> ocker<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.890> gonna

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
an early riser ocker so it's gonna

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000 
an early riser ocker so it's gonna
initiate<00:01:02.579> turns<00:01:03.120> really<00:01:03.390> easily<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
initiate turns really easily and the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
initiate turns really easily and the
tail<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.000> stiffer<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
tail is a little bit stiffer so when you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870 
tail is a little bit stiffer so when you
get<00:01:07.080> into<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.470> carve<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
get into that carve it's gonna have the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.460 
get into that carve it's gonna have the
power<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> stability<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.290> need

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
power and the stability that you need

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
power and the stability that you need
line<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.670> gave<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.150> what's<00:01:12.450> called<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
line also gave these what's called a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920 
line also gave these what's called a
five<00:01:13.380> side<00:01:13.920> cut<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.549> means<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
five side cut it just means that the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
five side cut it just means that the
radius<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> side<00:01:16.860> cut<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.400> blended<00:01:18.119> it's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
radius of the side cut is blended it's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450 
radius of the side cut is blended it's
different<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.840> different<00:01:18.869> places<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.159> if

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
different in different places so if

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
different in different places so if
you've<00:01:20.580> ever<00:01:20.759> skied<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> pair<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.720> skis

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
you've ever skied on a pair of skis

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.600 
you've ever skied on a pair of skis
where<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.320> seems<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> only<00:01:23.100> wants<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
where it seems like it only wants to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
where it seems like it only wants to
turn<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.259> either<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.830> wants<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
turn you know it either only wants to

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
turn you know it either only wants to
turn<00:01:26.369> wide<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.939> only<00:01:27.030> wants<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.509> turn

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
turn wide or it only wants to turn

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
turn wide or it only wants to turn
really<00:01:28.020> tight<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.040> these<00:01:29.189> skis
