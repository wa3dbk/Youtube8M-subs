while to figure out what this bracket
was<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> how<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.979> went<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> choke

brackets<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.649> piece<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.979> plastic

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
brackets because the piece of plastic

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
brackets because the piece of plastic
you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.939> cracked<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.930> made

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
you can see is cracked so we made

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
you can see is cracked so we made
brackets<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> they're<00:01:58.890> drying<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.490> from

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
brackets and they're drying now from

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.950 
brackets and they're drying now from
paint<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.299> they're<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.659> cover<00:02:00.840> all

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
paint that they're going to cover all

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.560 
paint that they're going to cover all
this

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
this

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.840 
this
so<00:02:03.260> anyways<00:02:03.620> we'll<00:02:03.860> finish<00:02:04.040> wiring<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.640> up

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
so anyways we'll finish wiring this up

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.220 
so anyways we'll finish wiring this up
and<00:02:05.060> then<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:05.300> can<00:02:05.480> see<00:02:05.720> how<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.900> runs<00:02:06.080> that

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
and then we can see how it runs that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:03:02.310 
and then we can see how it runs that
will<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> startup

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:41.449 

yeah

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.800 

looks<00:03:41.579> like<00:03:41.730> we<00:03:41.849> get<00:03:41.939> a<00:03:42.000> lightbulb<00:03:42.359> out<00:03:42.599> in<00:03:42.719> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
looks like we get a lightbulb out in the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:04:02.630 
looks like we get a lightbulb out in the
back

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.430 

and<00:04:03.210> are<00:04:03.480> charging

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.140 

voltage<00:04:10.100> regulator<00:04:10.550> I<00:04:10.640> don't<00:04:10.790> know<00:04:10.850> if<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.030> was

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
voltage regulator I don't know if it was

00:04:11.150 --> 00:05:11.549 
voltage regulator I don't know if it was
good

00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:11.559 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:14.699 

popplers<00:05:12.219> burn<00:05:12.549> up<00:05:12.759> all<00:05:13.029> that<00:05:13.209> paint<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:14.529> help

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:14.709 
popplers burn up all that paint to help

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:15.590 
popplers burn up all that paint to help
us<00:05:14.889> with<00:05:15.129> it

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
us with it

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:29.200 
us with it
that<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.990> pipes<00:05:16.230> has<00:05:16.470> some<00:05:16.680> oil<00:05:16.890> on

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:06:28.100 

deep

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.920 

you

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.800 

well<00:06:32.930> folks<00:06:33.229> it<00:06:33.470> ran<00:06:33.650> pretty<00:06:33.919> good<00:06:34.720> started<00:06:35.720> up

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
well folks it ran pretty good started up

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.379 
well folks it ran pretty good started up
pretty<00:06:36.050> nice<00:06:36.289> and<00:06:36.620> ran<00:06:37.069> a<00:06:37.100> lot<00:06:37.460> smoother<00:06:38.030> and<00:06:38.180> I

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
pretty nice and ran a lot smoother and I

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.120 
pretty nice and ran a lot smoother and I
figured<00:06:38.690> it<00:06:38.780> was<00:06:38.900> going<00:06:39.110> to<00:06:39.169> be<00:06:39.289> those<00:06:39.860> new

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
figured it was going to be those new

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.890 
figured it was going to be those new
piston<00:06:40.520> and<00:06:40.610> rings<00:06:40.849> really<00:06:41.210> helped<00:06:41.479> out<00:06:41.630> I

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
piston and rings really helped out I

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.570 
piston and rings really helped out I
don't<00:06:42.560> know<00:06:42.680> if<00:06:42.710> you<00:06:42.830> could<00:06:42.949> see<00:06:43.160> but<00:06:43.340> it<00:06:43.430> was

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
don't know if you could see but it was

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.279 
don't know if you could see but it was
burning<00:06:43.970> off<00:06:44.090> some<00:06:44.120> stuff<00:06:44.569> as<00:06:44.720> I<00:06:44.870> said<00:06:45.110> in<00:06:45.199> the

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
burning off some stuff as I said in the

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:47.140 
burning off some stuff as I said in the
video<00:06:45.560> it's<00:06:46.340> going<00:06:46.520> to<00:06:46.580> end<00:06:46.699> up<00:06:46.729> burning<00:06:46.970> off

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
video it's going to end up burning off

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.129 
video it's going to end up burning off
some<00:06:47.180> of<00:06:47.419> that<00:06:47.509> paint<00:06:47.810> because<00:06:47.990> this

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
some of that paint because this

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.469 
some of that paint because this
rust-oleum<00:06:48.680> wasn't<00:06:49.160> high<00:06:49.280> temp<00:06:49.610> paint<00:06:49.880> and

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
rust-oleum wasn't high temp paint and

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.870 
rust-oleum wasn't high temp paint and
the<00:06:50.720> stack<00:06:50.990> from<00:06:51.349> the<00:06:51.500> 1277<00:06:52.340> is<00:06:52.580> going<00:06:52.729> to<00:06:52.789> end

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 
the stack from the 1277 is going to end

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.520 
the stack from the 1277 is going to end
up<00:06:52.970> going<00:06:53.120> on<00:06:53.509> here<00:06:53.870> so<00:06:53.990> it'll<00:06:54.110> have<00:06:54.289> a<00:06:54.319> nice

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
up going on here so it'll have a nice

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.040 
up going on here so it'll have a nice
stack<00:06:54.889> muffler<00:06:55.400> and<00:06:55.580> I<00:06:56.509> got<00:06:56.660> to<00:06:56.750> fix<00:06:56.900> the

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
stack muffler and I got to fix the

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.249 
stack muffler and I got to fix the
charging<00:06:57.470> system<00:06:57.620> also<00:06:57.949> like<00:06:58.639> I<00:06:58.759> said<00:06:59.060> I<00:06:59.270> think

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
charging system also like I said I think

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.650 
charging system also like I said I think
this<00:07:00.650> voltage<00:07:01.639> regulator<00:07:02.120> might<00:07:02.300> be<00:07:02.449> bad

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 
this voltage regulator might be bad

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.390 
this voltage regulator might be bad
because<00:07:03.050> they<00:07:03.169> came<00:07:03.349> off<00:07:03.500> of<00:07:03.530> a<00:07:03.710> parts<00:07:04.009> tractor

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
because they came off of a parts tractor

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.650 
because they came off of a parts tractor
we<00:07:04.490> really<00:07:04.729> didn't<00:07:04.940> know<00:07:05.030> if<00:07:05.060> it<00:07:05.240> worked<00:07:05.479> or

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
we really didn't know if it worked or

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.409 
we really didn't know if it worked or
not<00:07:05.720> so<00:07:06.349> I'll<00:07:06.710> have<00:07:06.889> to<00:07:07.039> go<00:07:07.280> through<00:07:07.520> that<00:07:07.699> I'm

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
not so I'll have to go through that I'm

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.670 
not so I'll have to go through that I'm
going<00:07:08.630> to<00:07:08.720> have<00:07:08.810> letting<00:07:09.050> this<00:07:09.169> run<00:07:09.410> for<00:07:09.650> a

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
going to have letting this run for a

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.170 
going to have letting this run for a
little<00:07:09.770> bit<00:07:10.009> longer<00:07:10.190> make<00:07:10.729> sure<00:07:10.910> that<00:07:11.060> the

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180 
little bit longer make sure that the

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.060 
little bit longer make sure that the
piston<00:07:11.509> rings<00:07:11.840> wear<00:07:12.110> themselves<00:07:12.650> in<00:07:12.770> pretty

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
piston rings wear themselves in pretty

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.120 
piston rings wear themselves in pretty
good<00:07:13.250> seem<00:07:14.180> like<00:07:14.330> a<00:07:14.360> drive<00:07:14.690> pretty<00:07:15.500> good<00:07:15.740> drove

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.130 
good seem like a drive pretty good drove

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.950 
good seem like a drive pretty good drove
pretty<00:07:16.340> good<00:07:16.580> off<00:07:16.820> the<00:07:16.880> side<00:07:17.210> of<00:07:17.330> the<00:07:17.419> hill<00:07:17.630> no

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
pretty good off the side of the hill no

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.439 
pretty good off the side of the hill no
problems<00:07:18.410> with<00:07:18.530> that<00:07:18.590> so<00:07:18.979> it<00:07:19.970> turned<00:07:20.210> out<00:07:20.300> to

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:20.449 
problems with that so it turned out to

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.450 
problems with that so it turned out to
be<00:07:20.479> a<00:07:20.599> pretty<00:07:20.900> nice<00:07:21.110> tractor<00:07:21.680> I'm<00:07:21.949> very<00:07:22.160> happy

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
be a pretty nice tractor I'm very happy

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.640 
be a pretty nice tractor I'm very happy
with<00:07:22.580> the<00:07:22.699> way<00:07:22.820> it<00:07:22.940> came<00:07:22.970> out<00:07:23.330> last<00:07:24.289> thing<00:07:24.560> we

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
with the way it came out last thing we

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.800 
with the way it came out last thing we
got<00:07:24.680> to<00:07:24.830> do<00:07:25.039> is<00:07:25.220> paint<00:07:26.060> the<00:07:26.120> wheel<00:07:26.330> rims<00:07:26.599> and

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810 
got to do is paint the wheel rims and

got to do is paint the wheel rims and
everything<00:07:26.870> and<00:07:27.440> that'll<00:07:27.830> be<00:07:27.979> good<00:07:28.220> to<00:07:29.030> go<00:07:29.180> for
