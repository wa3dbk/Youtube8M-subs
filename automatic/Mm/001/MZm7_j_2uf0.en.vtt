before<00:00:17.939> I<00:00:18.150> start<00:00:18.450> though<00:00:18.599> I<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:19.079> to<00:00:19.140> say<00:00:19.289> that

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
before I start though I want to say that

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.080 
before I start though I want to say that
this<00:00:19.500> space<00:00:19.829> actually<00:00:20.430> seems<00:00:20.669> to<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:20.910> held

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
this space actually seems to have held

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.689 
this space actually seems to have held
up<00:00:21.240> pretty<00:00:21.509> well<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:22.020> 31<00:00:22.650> total<00:00:22.949> defensive

wins to date now I realize a das could
have<00:00:26.610> dropped<00:00:26.759> to<00:00:26.969> a<00:00:27.000> lower<00:00:27.270> trophy<00:00:27.779> league

is<00:00:35.010> quite<00:00:35.309> impressive<00:00:35.539> all<00:00:36.539> right<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.840> looking

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
is quite impressive all right so looking

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930 
is quite impressive all right so looking
at<00:00:37.289> this<00:00:37.379> base<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.829> greater<00:00:38.039> detail<00:00:38.460> notice

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
at this base in greater detail notice

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.100 
at this base in greater detail notice
how<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.750> would<00:00:39.840> call<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
how this is what you would call a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.380 
how this is what you would call a
southern<00:00:40.649> teaser<00:00:40.980> type<00:00:41.340> base<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> reason

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
southern teaser type base and the reason

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.700 
southern teaser type base and the reason
is<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.659> Town<00:00:42.870> Hall<00:00:42.899> looks<00:00:43.289> extremely

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
is the Town Hall looks extremely

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.649 
is the Town Hall looks extremely
vulnerable<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.550> that's<00:00:44.730> basically<00:00:44.940> because

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
vulnerable but that's basically because

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.270 
vulnerable but that's basically because
that's<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> designer<00:00:46.769> wants<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that's what the designer wants you to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
that's what the designer wants you to
believe<00:00:47.429> and<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.659> try<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.929> attack<00:00:49.199> from

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
believe and if you do try to attack from

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.139 
believe and if you do try to attack from
the<00:00:49.469> bottom<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:50.219> are<00:00:50.399> met<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.819> bunch<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the bottom you are met with a bunch of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.360 
the bottom you are met with a bunch of
traps<00:00:51.449> Tesla's<00:00:52.230> heroes<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.920> clan<00:00:53.159> castle

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
traps Tesla's heroes and clan castle

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
traps Tesla's heroes and clan castle
troops<00:00:53.719> basically<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.839> stop<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.229> from<00:00:55.260> taking

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
troops basically to stop you from taking

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.130 
troops basically to stop you from taking
that<00:00:55.829> town<00:00:56.100> hall<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:57.149> generally<00:00:57.749> the<00:00:57.929> weak

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that town hall now generally the weak

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.290 
that town hall now generally the weak
point<00:00:58.409> of<00:00:58.589> the<00:00:58.710> southern<00:00:59.010> teaser<00:00:59.249> is<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.089> want

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
point of the southern teaser is you want

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.180 
point of the southern teaser is you want
to<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.479> from<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> top<00:01:00.839> do<00:01:01.409> not<00:01:01.679> take<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.159> bait

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to go from the top do not take the bait

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.969 
to go from the top do not take the bait
at<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> bottom<00:01:02.999> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> base<00:01:03.479> and<00:01:03.979> hopefully

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
at the bottom of the base and hopefully

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.010 
at the bottom of the base and hopefully
on<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> top<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.970> attack<00:01:06.270> from<00:01:06.720> there

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
on the top if you do attack from there

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.990 
on the top if you do attack from there
you<00:01:07.290> destroy<00:01:07.890> enough<00:01:08.220> buildings<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.880> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you destroy enough buildings for that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
you destroy enough buildings for that
fifty<00:01:09.299> percent<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.409> while<00:01:10.680> most<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.190> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
fifty percent now while most of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.890 
fifty percent now while most of the
times<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> weak<00:01:12.000> point<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.690> top

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
times the weak point is from the top

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.440 
times the weak point is from the top
other<00:01:13.229> times<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.190> southern<00:01:15.120> teaser

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
other times there are southern teaser

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
other times there are southern teaser
layouts<00:01:15.810> where<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.710> are<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.370> of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
layouts where there are a lot of

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.920 
layouts where there are a lot of
buildings<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> bottom<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.780> could

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
buildings on the bottom that you could

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
buildings on the bottom that you could
potentially<00:01:19.110> grab<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.160> fifty<00:01:20.490> percent

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
potentially grab for that fifty percent

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
potentially grab for that fifty percent
so<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> weak<00:01:21.900> point<00:01:22.170> isn't<00:01:22.440> always<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.800> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so the weak point isn't always on the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280 
so the weak point isn't always on the
top<00:01:23.070> side<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> base<00:01:23.810> alright<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:24.960> notice

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
top side of the base alright so notice

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
top side of the base alright so notice
how<00:01:25.410> with<00:01:25.560> trophy<00:01:25.890> bases<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> storages<00:01:26.850> are

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
how with trophy bases the storages are

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.150 
how with trophy bases the storages are
on<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.300> outer<00:01:27.510> layer<00:01:27.870> of<00:01:27.900> walls<00:01:28.200> basically

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
on that outer layer of walls basically

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.000 
on that outer layer of walls basically
to<00:01:29.280> act<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:30.150> barricade<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.860> this

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
to act as a barricade now I like this

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.710 
to act as a barricade now I like this
base<00:01:32.280> though<00:01:32.550> because<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:33.180> heroes<00:01:33.480> in<00:01:33.510> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
base though because the heroes in the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
base though because the heroes in the
clan<00:01:33.930> castle<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.530> cover<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.040> base

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
clan castle can cover the base

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
clan castle can cover the base
regardless<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.060> whether<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.510> attacker

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
regardless of whether the attacker

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.020 
regardless of whether the attacker
approaches<00:01:37.530> from<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> top<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> bottom

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
approaches from the top of the bottom

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.150 
approaches from the top of the bottom
now<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.870> most<00:01:40.110> part<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.620> farm<00:01:41.010> I

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
now for the most part when I farm I

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.220 
now for the most part when I farm I
usually<00:01:41.490> hit<00:01:41.880> next<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:42.450> attacking<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
usually hit next when attacking the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.740 
usually hit next when attacking the
southern<00:01:43.500> teaser<00:01:43.920> type<00:01:44.220> basis<00:01:44.750> mainly

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
southern teaser type basis mainly

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.630 
southern teaser type basis mainly
because<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.290> storage<00:01:46.560> placement<00:01:47.100> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because of the storage placement but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
because of the storage placement but
when<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:47.970> trophy<00:01:48.300> pushing<00:01:48.660> sometimes<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
when I was trophy pushing sometimes it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.990 
when I was trophy pushing sometimes it
was<00:01:49.470> easy<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> fifty<00:01:50.400> percent<00:01:50.760> on

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
was easy to get a fifty percent on

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.660 
was easy to get a fifty percent on
southern<00:01:51.720> teaser<00:01:52.140> layouts<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.520> did

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
southern teaser layouts but it did

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
southern teaser layouts but it did
depend<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.240> layout<00:01:54.510> other<00:01:54.750> times<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.350> would

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
depend on the layout other times I would

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.770 
depend on the layout other times I would
fail<00:01:55.950> completely<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.210> depending<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.720> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
fail completely so depending on the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.510 
fail completely so depending on the
actual<00:01:57.960> layout<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.740> southern<00:01:59.010> teaser<00:01:59.250> I
