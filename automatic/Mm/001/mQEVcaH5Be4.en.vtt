or<00:02:10.259> something<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:13.099> but<00:02:14.099> yeah<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.459> is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
or something like that but yeah this is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.240 
or something like that but yeah this is

playable and then when I turned down the
low<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.200> then<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> maximized<00:02:37.920> my<00:02:38.190> video

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760

low and then I maximized my video
graphics<00:02:39.330> settings<00:02:39.769> within<00:02:40.769> windows<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.459> I

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
graphics settings within windows and I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.869 
graphics settings within windows and I
put<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.220> performance<00:02:44.220> instead<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.519> quality

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
put it on performance instead of quality

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.220 
put it on performance instead of quality
and<00:02:44.910> he<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.510> even<00:02:45.750> better<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:48.269> we're<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.510> 47

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and he was even better so so we're at 47

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.170 
and he was even better so so we're at 47
48<00:02:50.099> seconds<00:02:50.459> with<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.819> logo<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.910> go<00:02:54.060> ahead

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
48 seconds with the logo and go ahead

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.070 
48 seconds with the logo and go ahead
and<00:02:54.300> get<00:02:54.390> ready<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.599> stop<00:02:54.870> once<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:56.930> once<00:02:57.930> it's

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
and get ready to stop once it once it's

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.540 
and get ready to stop once it once it's
the<00:02:58.170> desktop<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.709> music<00:02:59.010> comes<00:02:59.159> on<00:02:59.310> that's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
the desktop the music comes on that's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.130 
the desktop the music comes on that's
pretty<00:02:59.790> much<00:02:59.879> a<00:02:59.940> stopped<00:03:00.440> because<00:03:01.940> stop

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
pretty much a stopped because stop

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.780 
pretty much a stopped because stop
clocks<00:03:04.140> there<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:05.459> that's<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.150> ready<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.599> go

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
clocks there and that's it ready to go

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.960 
clocks there and that's it ready to go
so<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.959> looks<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.170> we're<00:03:10.440> at<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.830> minute<00:03:11.310> two

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
so it looks like we're at a minute two

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.449 
so it looks like we're at a minute two
seconds<00:03:12.450> from<00:03:12.650> Folker<00:03:13.650> start<00:03:13.890> which<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.129> crazy

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
seconds from Folker start which is crazy

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.210 
seconds from Folker start which is crazy
because<00:03:14.930> it's<00:03:15.930> only<00:03:16.140> 10<00:03:16.319> seconds<00:03:16.709> smaller<00:03:17.040> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
because it's only 10 seconds smaller to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.720 
because it's only 10 seconds smaller to
start<00:03:17.489> from<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.849> cold<00:03:18.090> start<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.610> that's<00:03:20.610> it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
start from a cold start so that's it

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.199 
start from a cold start so that's it

on three one two three this is just
