00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.940
 I'm a belt coach and today we're going to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.530
 talk about how to run faster in the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.110
 tennis court how to move faster 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.500
 move more neighborhood first we're going to 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.150
 talk about speed in a straight line how 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.160
 accelerate faster by running to rock 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.670
 shox running last minute balls 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.470
 ok let's talk about three elements three 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.780
 or four fundamental elements for 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.220
 to be able to go faster on the court 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.890
 tennis number one 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.620
 we must work to maintain the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.210
 high knees if you keep keeping the 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.060
 knees practicing lifting them 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.520
 knees to help you generate and 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.530
 develop more muscles in the part 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.870
 high of the legs of the quadriceps 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.380
 that we want to create then let's 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.930
 work on the 34 elements by raising 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.310
 the knees lifting the heels 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.640
 let's train also by raising the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.010
 heels to go faster 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.380
 tilt forward with the tip 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.520
 of the feet not with the heels with the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.190
 toes and number 4 pulling with 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 the arms every time one starts with 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.140
 you start you have to help yourself with the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.210
 arms like a train you have to pull with 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.120
 arms and feet not only with 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.660
 the feet ok I 'll give an example of the 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.660
 three now 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.580
 why not 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.709
 this exercise that we are doing 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.659
 right now they are going to help you 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.159
 do go faster is better if you 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.269
 practice with a longer distance 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.269
 like a whole court 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.180
 it was the four examples that 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.360
 you should practice you can repeat it one and 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.879
 again knees up training 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.040
 heels from the back up towards the 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.480
 buttocks 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.310
 pulling with arms 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.920
 and maintaining an inclination with the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.230
 head stepping with the tip of the feet 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.569
 not with the heels 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.129
 thanks for another training class 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.670
 mobility how to be faster in the 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.670
