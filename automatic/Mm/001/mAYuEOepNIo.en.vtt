00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello in this video I want the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.150
 playmobil advent calendar reiterhof short 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.280
 imagine the four to ten years or 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.099
 from four to ten years is suitable 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.590
 how to recognize them costs about 15 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.330
 euro and yes I want to show what's there 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.439
 Everything is in it and above all things like 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
 that then in the finished state 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.600
 this inside may look like this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.160
 Packaging is then here accordingly 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.429
 the calendar with the individual doors 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.859
 you can not see them all here now 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.630
 up here is a 24 he had something like that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.110
 bigger and otherwise they are all here 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 and spread on the back is here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.540
 such an eyelash to impress and to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.489
 hang up the whole and it is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.800
 Also a bit of cardboard like that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.140
 are so erector you then too 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.010
 can set up and so should 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.539
 the whole then so should the whole then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.609
 look when it's done 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'll give it a try and the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.140
 open doors one after the other so here 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 again very briefly this pub on the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 which I have built now and now 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.630
 Let's start with the doors from 1 to 24 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.630
 have fun watching 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.880
 so and already the rider is complete 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.180
 They have noticed now they have noticed 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.650
 are not quite that were 24 steps 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.060
 only 22 people because once is one 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.900
 little bridle in it makes you 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.119
 not so much sense when you do this individually 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.480
 lie down and then there is still so 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.370
 a little puzzle where to go again 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.200
 as a rider can also copy motive 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.140
 which is not what I am either 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.790
 so tingling but so overall is 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.230
 That's a nice thing you can day 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.840
 build up a bit of what's up for the day and 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.850
 here in detail is but one 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.920
 really beautiful riding farm with many 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.190
 details have become a lot of thanks for 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.190
