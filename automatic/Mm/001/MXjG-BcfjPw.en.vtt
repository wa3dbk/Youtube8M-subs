no<00:02:26.969> sorry<00:02:27.750> I've<00:02:28.049> never<00:02:28.230> been<00:02:28.379> like<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.680> long

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
no sorry I've never been like a long

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.770 
no sorry I've never been like a long
time<00:02:29.609> so<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.939> is<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> closest<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.540> we<00:02:30.629> can

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
time so this is the closest that we can

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.099 
time so this is the closest that we can
get<00:02:30.989> right<00:02:31.290> yeah<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:32.569> we<00:02:33.569> packed<00:02:33.719> this<00:02:33.900> one

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
get right yeah and so we packed this one

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.970 
get right yeah and so we packed this one
with<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.489> 768<00:02:35.489> megahertz<00:02:35.969> of<00:02:36.739> processor<00:02:37.739> and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
with a 768 megahertz of processor and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.020 
with a 768 megahertz of processor and
then<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.959> 512mb<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.230> RAM<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.739> 512mb<00:02:41.459> of

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
then we have 512mb of RAM and 512mb of

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.539 
then we have 512mb of RAM and 512mb of
Rome<00:02:42.329> so<00:02:42.599> for<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.500> storage<00:02:43.739> capacity<00:02:44.430> it's

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
Rome so for the storage capacity it's

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.699 
Rome so for the storage capacity it's
big<00:02:45.030> already<00:02:45.540> considering<00:02:46.109> that<00:02:46.230> it's

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
big already considering that it's

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.589 
big already considering that it's
running<00:02:47.189> an<00:02:47.250> eclair<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.359> we<00:02:48.480> all<00:02:48.510> know

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
running an eclair and as we all know

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.520 
running an eclair and as we all know
Eclair<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.829> only<00:02:50.780> input<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.319> or

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
Eclair you can only input the or

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.860 
Eclair you can only input the or
installed<00:02:53.489> applications<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.569> internal

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
installed applications in the internal

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.259 
installed applications in the internal
memory<00:02:55.290> right<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:56.159> packed<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.909> big

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
memory right so we packed in with a big

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.300 
memory right so we packed in with a big
memory<00:02:57.450> photos<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.200> suppose<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:58.889> is<00:02:58.950> already

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
memory photos I suppose this is already

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.459 
memory photos I suppose this is already
charged<00:02:59.760> mmhmm<00:03:00.629> yeah<00:03:00.689> so<00:03:01.319> let's<00:03:01.530> switch<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.680> on

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469
