00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.690
 past and present to be convinced of the opposite side are in the 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.690
 woman but this did not come to share space 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.729
 he stopped the vehicle 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.729
 without leaving 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.869
 funeral was left behind 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.970
 also rely on technology investments to try to 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.310
 meet at the cinema 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.019
 he could not even have received the ticket 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.199
 otherwise 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.199
 is the comfort that technology guarantees 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.090
 can not predict an initiative taken from pv better conditioned 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 the government evaluates 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.780
 this same difference that umberto noticed when the bbb hit the market 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.630
 each of you will feel 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.010
 how technology only digital tv allows 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.650
 the transmission of images 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.480
 in high definition in attack 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.770
 my daughters 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.579
 quality that translates into 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.579
 numbers and still suffered another life 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.720
 on the conventional TV screen 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.330
 each image attraction you see is made up of 480 lines that occupy the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.390
 screen at very high speed already on the TV display said the high definition 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.570
 same image is formed by 1080 lines 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.110
 more than double the number of rows in the same period of time and beyond 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.530
 an amount of lines higher than that time in the underwear of a line 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.110
 number of points much higher than what we had analog system that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.900
 has an image that she has a competition far superior to that other 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 image here 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.060
 this first image is composed of many more lines by much more points 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.100
 which brings this wealth of detail to us and thinks it has a dam it was 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.060
 represented with fewer points and there is a deficiency in representation 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.900
 limitation of the number of points and in this case the 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.780
 image definition is so precise that the sensation one has 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.790
 he's in this week's spot on television, it's like people 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.019
 could well 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.819
 touch the water for example 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.140
 and all this here gets even closer 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.660
 details that this you will now realize because of hd technology 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.629
 with the quality that has already led many producers and lost the chance to assume 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.669
 new equipment that allows high definition image capture 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:31.079
 even before digital TV reaches the region 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.870
 what we do not vote today that they perceived a pattern of evolution that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.870
 it will be the digital tv 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
 this for example changed most of the equipment 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.030
 five hundred thousand reais of care expenses multiply 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.649
 from now on i hope my 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:55.339
 he denied that the same has no way things will evolve very fast this to 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.739
 people buy too late 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.349
 will have a loss 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.349
 It's true in the future. 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:07.689
 today the company already makes recordings in high definition but like the commercial tv 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.329
 is still analogical the viewer does not notice difference but it is an issue 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.490
 of days 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.750
 for example digital from now on, there's no way it's a nostalgia 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.739
 who wants 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 stand aside only promote the same 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:28.640
 verified in the Olympic stadium but how are these married and viana 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.339
 the digital TV can reach the point of the image definition that they are entitled to 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:37.460
 the family has already prepared with the best equipment available 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.949
 in electronics stores 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.229
 concrete the expectation with regard to the future 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.049
 how was it 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.510
 why do not you worry about what you heard 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.360
 a one-off action
