the<00:01:36.180> metal<00:01:36.299> body<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.439> why<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.619> have

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the metal body so that's why we have

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.380 
the metal body so that's why we have
this<00:01:38.009> plastic<00:01:38.520> window<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> back<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
this plastic window at the back of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.780 
this plastic window at the back of the
ipad<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.170> radio<00:01:40.470> transparency<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.640> is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
ipad for radio transparency this is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
ipad for radio transparency this is
something<00:01:41.909> we're<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.360> familiar<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
something we're all familiar with on the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
something we're all familiar with on the
larger<00:01:43.619> iPad<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.280> time<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> plastic<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
larger iPad but this time the plastic is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.359
