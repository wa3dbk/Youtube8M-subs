shortly<00:00:21.750> thereafter<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:22.560> these<00:00:22.740> were<00:00:22.890> in

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
shortly thereafter because these were in

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.790 
shortly thereafter because these were in
very<00:00:23.189> short<00:00:23.460> supply<00:00:24.320> when<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.439> first<00:00:25.619> came

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
very short supply when they first came

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.730 
very short supply when they first came
out<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> he<00:00:27.330> called<00:00:27.570> trying<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> buy<00:00:28.230> this

we<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:36.290> 21<00:00:37.290> years<00:00:37.559> later<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.840> he<00:00:39.840> did<00:00:40.020> decide

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
we are 21 years later and he did decide

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.010 
we are 21 years later and he did decide
to<00:00:40.350> sell<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.950> here's<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> pedal<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to sell this so here's the pedal so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:52.760 
to sell this so here's the pedal so
first<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> dry<00:00:44.340> tone<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> I'm

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
first we just have a dry tone and I'm

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580 
first we just have a dry tone and I'm
going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.420> blend<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:54.930> half<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
going to just blend in about half of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:14.300 
going to just blend in about half of
delay<00:00:56.340> only<00:00:56.550> effect<00:01:11.180> all<00:01:12.180> right<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:13.310> we

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
delay only effect all right and then we

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.740 
delay only effect all right and then we
can<00:01:14.340> mess<00:01:14.820> around<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> regeneration

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
can mess around with the regeneration

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.890 
can mess around with the regeneration
here<00:01:16.080> we'll<00:01:16.170> try<00:01:16.320> turning<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.900> see

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
here we'll try turning it on and see

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.899 
here we'll try turning it on and see
what<00:01:19.020> half<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> does<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.130> effect

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:53.450 

try<00:01:28.450> turning<00:01:28.630> up<00:01:28.840> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.149 

sorry<00:01:58.080> so<00:01:59.080> that's<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.409> delay<00:01:59.680> end<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.009> things

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
sorry so that's the delay end of things

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.800 
sorry so that's the delay end of things
and<00:02:00.280> then<00:02:00.430> if<00:02:00.520> we<00:02:00.610> turn<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.000> harmony<00:02:01.540> on<00:02:01.659> as

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
and then if we turn the harmony on as

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.130 
and then if we turn the harmony on as
well<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:03.610> get<00:02:05.850> chaos<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.180> turn<00:02:08.080> that

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
well we get chaos and turn that

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:29.119 
well we get chaos and turn that
regeneration<00:02:08.709> though

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:38.390 

so<00:02:30.129> you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.280> really<00:02:30.430> go<00:02:30.640> low<00:02:30.940> with<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.390> thing

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.860 

that's<00:02:39.400> through<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> guitar<00:02:40.480> amp

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that's through a guitar amp

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:52.009 
that's through a guitar amp
well<00:02:41.190> Princeton<00:02:46.799> actually<00:02:47.799> hear<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.220> but

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.270 

chords<00:02:53.019> sound<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.530> little<00:02:53.620> weird<00:02:53.920> through<00:02:54.190> this

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
chords sound a little weird through this

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.229 
chords sound a little weird through this
thing<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:58.540> anymore<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:59.940> stretch<00:03:00.940> her<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
thing do anymore that stretch her in the

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.710 
thing do anymore that stretch her in the
delay<00:03:05.609> can<00:03:06.609> actually<00:03:06.879> bring<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.150> mix<00:03:07.480> back

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
delay can actually bring this mix back

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:17.610 
delay can actually bring this mix back
to<00:03:07.900> tomorrow<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.510> that's<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.079> harmony<00:03:17.590> and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
to tomorrow so that's the harmony and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.349 
to tomorrow so that's the harmony and
then<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.840> harmony<00:03:19.840> B<00:03:20.079> section<00:03:21.090> seems<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.239> be<00:03:22.329> a

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
then the harmony B section seems to be a

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:42.410 
then the harmony B section seems to be a
momentary<00:03:22.900> switch<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.859> these

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.750 

and<00:03:43.290> then<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.560> switches<00:03:43.740> back<00:03:46.520> switches<00:03:47.520> back

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
and then it switches back switches back

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.580 
and then it switches back switches back
when<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.350> release<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.380> switch<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:51.150> then

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
when you release the switch and then

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.470 
when you release the switch and then
that's<00:03:52.590> pretty<00:03:52.920> much<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.459> that's<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
that's pretty much it that's the the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.360 
that's pretty much it that's the the
Grand<00:03:54.720> Tour<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.620> course<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.040> switch<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
Grand Tour of course you can switch the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.210 
Grand Tour of course you can switch the
pedal<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.910> effect<00:03:57.900> off<00:03:58.170> and<00:04:00.860> back<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.040> just

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
pedal the effect off and back to just

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.420 
pedal the effect off and back to just
normal<00:04:02.550> strat<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:04.170> that's<00:04:04.380> an<00:04:05.040> overview<00:04:05.100> of

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
normal strat so that's an overview of

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.010 
normal strat so that's an overview of
the<00:04:05.550> pedal<00:04:05.880> I'll<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.300> kind<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.630> do<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> walk

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
the pedal I'll just kind of do a walk

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:22.780 
the pedal I'll just kind of do a walk
around<00:04:08.690> here<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:10.020> what<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.680> looks<00:04:10.860> like

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:32.159 

pretty<00:04:23.790> clean<00:04:24.120> condition

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:56.909 

since<00:04:32.860> upside-down

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.640 

and<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.789> think<00:04:57.939> we<00:04:58.090> should<00:04:58.150> probably<00:04:58.469> hear<00:04:59.469> it<00:04:59.590> a

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
and I think we should probably hear it a

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:58.450 
and I think we should probably hear it a
little<00:04:59.740> bit<00:04:59.949> more<00:05:05.370> before<00:05:06.370> we<00:05:06.550> go<00:05:23.039> okay

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.999 

thanks<00:05:59.460> for<00:05:59.580> checking<00:05:59.699> it<00:05:59.909> out
