these things I just couldn't believe how
good<00:02:56.520> they<00:02:56.640> were<00:02:56.900> Windsor<00:02:57.900> Newton<00:02:58.050> pan<00:02:58.440> and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
good they were Windsor Newton pan and

differently<00:03:00.740> many<00:03:01.740> artists<00:03:02.220> take<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.970> tube

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
differently many artists take the tube

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.870 
differently many artists take the tube
color<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.780> squeeze<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.680> out<00:03:04.800> onto<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.459> pallet

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
color and squeeze it out onto a pallet

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.870 
color and squeeze it out onto a pallet
and<00:03:06.060> they<00:03:06.720> allow<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.020> color<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.590> dry<00:03:07.880> this

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
and they allow the color to dry this

what<00:03:11.190> will<00:03:11.280> happen<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.000> color<00:03:12.209> becomes

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
what will happen is the color becomes

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.020 
what will happen is the color becomes
very<00:03:12.720> dry<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.560> some<00:03:13.740> cases<00:03:13.950> gray<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.640> it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
because there were the small pans but

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.490 
because there were the small pans but
now<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.360> we<00:03:48.420> have<00:03:48.660> these<00:03:48.840> large<00:03:49.080> pans
