00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
better now I kind of break it down to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.450 
better now I kind of break it down to
you<00:00:47.399> my<00:00:47.579> opinion<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.239> matter<00:00:49.309> first<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you my opinion on this matter first of

you my opinion on this matter first of
all<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:50.879> windows<00:00:51.239> seven<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> be

all I think windows seven is going to be

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
all I think windows seven is going to be
a<00:00:52.020> necessary<00:00:52.289> upgrade<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.190> windows<00:00:53.460> XP<00:00:53.579> users

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
a necessary upgrade for windows XP users

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
a necessary upgrade for windows XP users
I<00:00:54.270> mean<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I mean it's going to be in you have to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.369 
I mean it's going to be in you have to
upgrade<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> were<00:00:56.879> using<00:00:57.059> Windows<00:00:57.420> XP<00:00:57.690> you

upgrade if you were using Windows XP you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.080 
upgrade if you were using Windows XP you
definitely<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:59.280> windows<00:00:59.579> seven<00:00:59.609> because<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
definitely get windows seven because the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.580 
definitely get windows seven because the
econo<00:01:00.359> behind<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> curve<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> very

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
econo behind the curve at the very

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
econo behind the curve at the very
outdated<00:01:02.129> operating<00:01:02.820> system<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.510> probably

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
outdated operating system which probably

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
outdated operating system which probably
one<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.049> fine<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.460> running<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
one is fine now but you can be running a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
one is fine now but you can be running a
lot<00:01:06.030> better<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.540> renault<00:01:06.780> 7<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.590> for

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
lot better with renault 7 now for

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.399 
lot better with renault 7 now for
Windows<00:01:08.070> Vista<00:01:08.189> users<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:10.020> when

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
Windows Vista users not so much when

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
Windows Vista users not so much when
Windows<00:01:10.920> Vista<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.670> stable<00:01:11.970> right<00:01:12.150> now

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
Windows Vista is pretty stable right now

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.510 
Windows Vista is pretty stable right now
you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> necessary<00:01:14.040> upgrade

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you know it's not a necessary upgrade

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.980 
you know it's not a necessary upgrade
for<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> users<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> should

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
for you users but I think you should

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050 
for you users but I think you should
probably<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.500> least<00:01:16.650> try<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> bait<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
probably at least try to bait out and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.520 
probably at least try to bait out and
you<00:01:18.150> probably<00:01:18.420> end<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.810> liking<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.439> it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you probably end up liking it because it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.020 
you probably end up liking it because it
is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> lot<00:01:19.950> better<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> lot<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.640> fluent

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
is a lot better a lot more fluent

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
is a lot better a lot more fluent
definitely<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> lot<00:01:21.840> more<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.080> appealing<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
definitely a lot more I appealing and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
definitely a lot more I appealing and
more<00:01:23.189> user-friendly<00:01:23.869> windows<00:01:24.869> seven<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
more user-friendly windows seven is

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.580 
more user-friendly windows seven is
compared<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> vista<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.689> front<00:01:28.380> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
compared to vista so on that front I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.030 
compared to vista so on that front I
think<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> Windows<00:01:30.110> Windows<00:01:31.110> 7<00:01:31.500> has<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> lot

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
think that Windows Windows 7 has a lot

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520 
think that Windows Windows 7 has a lot
to<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.790> gain<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.840> trust<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.380> his

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to do to really gain the trust of his

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.710 
to do to really gain the trust of his
customers<00:01:34.829> back<00:01:35.310> due<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.299> problems<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
customers back due to the problems that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.270 
customers back due to the problems that
Windows<00:01:37.079> Vista<00:01:37.170> had<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> beginning<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
Windows Vista had at the beginning and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.390 
Windows Vista had at the beginning and
due<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> outdoor<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.250> so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
due to a lot of outdoor about it and so

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.889 
due to a lot of outdoor about it and so
it<00:01:41.610> definitely<00:01:42.000> has<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it definitely has a lot more on the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.749 
it definitely has a lot more on the
shoulders<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> plane<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.549> think

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
shoulders but at the plane with I think

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.399 
shoulders but at the plane with I think
Microsoft<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.540> has<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> winner<00:01:46.290> right

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
Microsoft is really has a winner right

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.350 
Microsoft is really has a winner right
now<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.549> definitely<00:01:47.909> taking<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> step

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
now and the definitely taking a step

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
now and the definitely taking a step
forward<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:49.110> direction<00:01:49.140> there's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
forward in the right direction there's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.740 
forward in the right direction there's
snow<00:01:50.340> leopard<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.360> even<00:01:51.630> much

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
snow leopard it's not really even much

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
snow leopard it's not really even much
unnecessary<00:01:52.049> upgrade<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.070> everybody

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490

of like what Apple is doing snow leopard
with<00:02:29.220> opencl<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.900> Windows<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.350> having

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
with opencl so Windows is having

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.770 
with opencl so Windows is having
something<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.130> kind<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.430> similar<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.820> what's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
looking for from the pc perspective it's

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.070 
looking for from the pc perspective it's
definitely<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> be<00:03:35.400> better<00:03:35.760> because<00:03:36.720> it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
definitely going to be better because it

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.199 
definitely going to be better because it
definitely<00:03:37.709> improves<00:03:38.519> on<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.760> lot<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.030> things

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
definitely improves on a lot of things

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.080 
definitely improves on a lot of things
that<00:03:39.300> Windows<00:03:39.630> Vista<00:03:39.750> was<00:03:40.080> lacking<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:41.090> and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
that Windows Vista was lacking and and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.430 
that Windows Vista was lacking and and
definitely<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.810> going<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> be<00:03:43.110> one<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.350> those

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
definitely is going to be one of those

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.380 
definitely is going to be one of those
things<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.800> really<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.250> trying<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.610> when

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
things that really just trying to when

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.699 
things that really just trying to when
the<00:03:45.540> customer<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:45.900> back<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.260> like<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.650> said

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
the customer is back and like I said

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.470 
the customer is back and like I said
before<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.220> does<00:03:47.340> do<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.580> great<00:03:47.880> job<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.239> that

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
before it does do a great job of that

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.449 
before it does do a great job of that
and<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.290> snow<00:03:49.470> leopard<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.830> really<00:03:50.040> not<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.430> of

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
and so snow leopard is really not one of

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.470 
and so snow leopard is really not one of
those<00:03:50.610> type<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.850> updates<00:03:51.420> i<00:03:51.600> can't<00:03:51.840> really

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
those type of updates i can't really

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.030 
those type of updates i can't really
combative<00:03:54.480> league<00:03:54.750> compare<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.530> windows

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
combative league compare that to windows

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.590 
combative league compare that to windows
7<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.430> far<00:03:56.610> as<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.850> concerned<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.450> don't

know it just doesn't just not as a big

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.900

of<00:04:07.590> an<00:04:07.680> update<00:04:07.860> as<00:04:08.130> windows<00:04:08.400> seven<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:08.790> I

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
of an update as windows seven is I

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.340 
of an update as windows seven is I
really<00:04:09.090> think<00:04:09.299> Villa<00:04:09.570> 7<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:09.900> pretty<00:04:10.110> good

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
really think Villa 7 is pretty good

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.160 
really think Villa 7 is pretty good
pretty<00:04:10.560> solid<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.519> my<00:04:12.030> point<00:04:12.299> on<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.540> my<00:04:12.750> final

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
pretty solid so my point on it my final

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.259 
pretty solid so my point on it my final
opinion<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.620> think<00:04:13.650> 107<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.820> more<00:04:15.090> necessary

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
opinion I think 107 is a more necessary

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.719 
opinion I think 107 is a more necessary
upgrade<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.260> in<00:04:16.440> my<00:04:16.919> opinion<00:04:17.220> that's<00:04:17.370> why<00:04:17.580> it

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
upgrade that in my opinion that's why it

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.640 
upgrade that in my opinion that's why it
will<00:04:17.820> be<00:04:17.940> better<00:04:18.150> not<00:04:18.750> necessary<00:04:19.229> that<00:04:19.530> it's

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
will be better not necessary that it's

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.529 
will be better not necessary that it's
going<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.830> be<00:04:19.919> better<00:04:20.580> technologies<00:04:21.359> and

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
going to be better technologies and

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.690 
going to be better technologies and
still<00:04:21.750> leopard<00:04:22.080> but<00:04:22.740> as<00:04:22.950> far<00:04:23.130> as<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.340> consumer

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
still leopard but as far as a consumer

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.500 
still leopard but as far as a consumer
outlook<00:04:24.300> 107<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:24.900> definitely<00:04:25.229> going<00:04:25.320> to

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
outlook 107 is definitely going to
