Copeland at a very disappointing year a
year<00:00:26.609> after<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.720> think<00:00:28.279> Florida<00:00:29.279> squad<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
year after and I think Florida squad and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.459 
year after and I think Florida squad and
the<00:00:31.349> coaching<00:00:31.920> staff<00:00:32.690> you<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.809> Tony<00:00:34.140> we

the coaching staff you know Tony we

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.639 
the coaching staff you know Tony we
would<00:00:34.620> learn<00:00:34.829> much<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.940> year<00:00:36.649> you

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
would learn much I think that year you

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.049 
would learn much I think that year you
know<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.950> year<00:00:38.129> after<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.640> want<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> heighten

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
know the year after we want to heighten

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.360 
know the year after we want to heighten
cop<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.719> terms<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:41.910> motivation<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
cop in terms of you know motivation and

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
cop in terms of you know motivation and
keeping<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.210> know<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.750> being

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
keeping going you know not not being

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.670 
keeping going you know not not being
satisfied<00:00:46.250> with<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.730> win<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.680> think

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
satisfied with just one win so I think

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.790 
satisfied with just one win so I think
the<00:00:50.219> experience<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.750> experience<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the experience of that experience of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.549 
the experience of that experience of
winning<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:54.079> not<00:00:55.079> been<00:00:55.440> able

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
winning it and then just not been able

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500 
winning it and then just not been able
to<00:00:55.739> find<00:00:55.890> ourselves<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.640> following<00:00:57.030> seasons

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to find ourselves the following seasons

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
to find ourselves the following seasons
nothing<00:00:57.780> able<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> find<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.500> highs<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
nothing able to find the highs of the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
nothing able to find the highs of the
previous<00:00:59.460> year<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> following<00:01:00.149> seas<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
previous year the following seas and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.900 
previous year the following seas and
probably<00:01:01.379> give<00:01:01.559> us<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> lot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> experience<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
probably give us a lot of experience and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.899 
probably give us a lot of experience and
then<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.739> year<00:01:05.010> we've<00:01:05.460> been<00:01:05.640> quite

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
then you know this year we've been quite

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.420 
then you know this year we've been quite
consistent<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.780> had<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> lull<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> middle

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
consistent we had a lull in the middle

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.020 
consistent we had a lull in the middle
of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> sea

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of the sea

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.250 
of the sea
we<00:01:09.240> lost<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.990> Ulster<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> fund<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.260> have

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
we lost to Ulster on to fund and have

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
we lost to Ulster on to fund and have
from<00:01:13.440> that<00:01:13.560> we've<00:01:13.830> been<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.250> well<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> think

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
from that we've been going well I think

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.450 
from that we've been going well I think
probably<00:01:15.840> competition<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.830> places<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.430> well

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
probably competition for places as well

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.430 
probably competition for places as well
in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> most<00:01:18.090> societies<00:01:18.450> been<00:01:18.840> massive<00:01:19.290> it's

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
in the most societies been massive it's

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.230 
in the most societies been massive it's
probably<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.920> something<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.460> had<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.060> we

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
probably not something we had that we

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.289 
probably not something we had that we
had<00:01:21.420> before<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.299> squatters

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
had before but you look at a squatters

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.139 
had before but you look at a squatters
that<00:01:25.140> blade<00:01:25.440> wireless<00:01:26.009> 6a<00:01:26.430> shins<00:01:26.670> around<00:01:27.000> they

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
that blade wireless 6a shins around they

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.080 
that blade wireless 6a shins around they
got<00:01:27.530> 14.7<00:01:28.530> possible<00:01:29.040> 15<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> micros

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
got 14.7 possible 15 in the micros

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.930 
got 14.7 possible 15 in the micros
League<00:01:30.300> so<00:01:30.950> competition<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.130> places<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.729> very

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
League so competition for places is very

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.760 
League so competition for places is very
high<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.840> means<00:01:34.080> everyone<00:01:34.470> is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
high as well and that means everyone is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.430 
high as well and that means everyone is
destroying<00:01:35.520> every<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.210> bit<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.259> do

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
destroying every little bit they can do

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.760 
destroying every little bit they can do
to<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> best<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.670> themselves<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.590> I'm<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
to get the best of themselves and I'm a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.340 
to get the best of themselves and I'm a
combination<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.640> lot<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.090> things

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
combination of a lot of little things

you take a breather maybe after getting

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
you take a breather maybe after getting
to<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> peak<00:01:53.550> or<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.300> think<00:01:54.539> we<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

in the comfortable but they even last

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.150 
in the comfortable but they even last
weekend<00:04:04.170> against<00:04:04.440> anchor<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.830> seemed<00:04:05.010> like

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
weekend against anchor it seemed like

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.450 
weekend against anchor it seemed like
you<00:04:05.280> can<00:04:05.460> move<00:04:05.550> up<00:04:05.700> another<00:04:05.940> couple<00:04:06.300> levels

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
you can move up another couple levels

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
you can move up another couple levels
interested<00:04:08.460> more<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.060> know

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
interested more in you know

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.530 
interested more in you know
I<00:04:10.069> don't<00:04:11.069> think<00:04:11.280> we<00:04:11.370> played<00:04:11.580> five<00:04:11.879> to<00:04:12.150> one<00:04:12.330> last

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
I don't think we played five to one last

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.020 
I don't think we played five to one last
week<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.900> think<00:04:12.959> we<00:04:13.349> are<00:04:13.980> work<00:04:14.340> great<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:14.879> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
week I think we are work great and the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.210 
week I think we are work great and the
intensity<00:04:15.510> with<00:04:15.840> failures<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.470> desire<00:04:16.979> we

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
intensity with failures and desire we

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.909 
intensity with failures and desire we
played<00:04:17.489> was<00:04:17.699> excellent<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.449> probably<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.620> lot

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
played was excellent but probably a lot

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.210 
played was excellent but probably a lot
of<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> finer<00:04:20.400> details<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:21.209> need<00:04:21.800> to<00:04:22.800> beat<00:04:22.979> to

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
of the finer details we need to beat to

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.250 
of the finer details we need to beat to
beat<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.639> Ospreys<00:04:24.120> property<00:04:24.510> wasn't<00:04:24.690> weren't

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
beat the Ospreys property wasn't weren't

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.530 
beat the Ospreys property wasn't weren't
there<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:25.860> I'm<00:04:26.040> that's<00:04:26.490> something<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:26.940> we've

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
there so I'm that's something that we've

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.250 
there so I'm that's something that we've
tried<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.139> focus<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.770> bit<00:04:28.979> this<00:04:29.160> week<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.580> to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
tried to focus on a bit this week is to

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.870 
tried to focus on a bit this week is to
make<00:04:31.260> sure<00:04:31.290> we<00:04:31.650> play<00:04:31.889> with<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.280> same

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
make sure we play with the same

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.939 
make sure we play with the same
intensity<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.690> make<00:04:33.840> sure<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.260> would<00:04:34.710> make

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
intensity and make sure that would make

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.350 
intensity and make sure that would make
sure<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.370> week<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.820> all<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.090> finer

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
sure this week that all the finer

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.140 
sure this week that all the finer
details<00:04:36.479> in<00:04:37.080> there<00:04:37.260> as<00:04:37.410> well<00:04:37.970> lujan<00:04:38.970> you're

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
details in there as well lujan you're

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.870 
details in there as well lujan you're
looking<00:04:39.419> for<00:04:39.860> yeah<00:04:40.860> very<00:04:41.130> much<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.610> mean

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
looking for yeah very much so I mean

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.850 
looking for yeah very much so I mean
that<00:04:42.090> we've<00:04:42.449> been<00:04:42.630> winning<00:04:42.780> games<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.530> that's

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
that we've been winning games and that's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.800 
that we've been winning games and that's
that's<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.669> most<00:04:44.820> enjoyable<00:04:45.210> part<00:04:45.660> of

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
that's the most enjoyable part of

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.960 
that's the most enjoyable part of
probably<00:04:45.990> that's<00:04:46.289> when<00:04:46.669> Morales<00:04:47.669> at<00:04:47.850> its

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
probably that's when Morales at its

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.060 
probably that's when Morales at its
highest<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.600> teeth<00:04:48.810> that's<00:04:49.139> when<00:04:49.380> you

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
highest in the teeth that's when you

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.560 
highest in the teeth that's when you
bounce<00:04:50.280> into<00:04:50.610> training<00:04:50.970> when<00:04:51.270> you're<00:04:51.389> reading

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
bounce into training when you're reading

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.460 
bounce into training when you're reading
so<00:04:51.990> on<00:04:52.340> that's<00:04:53.340> that's<00:04:53.669> that's<00:04:54.080> that's<00:04:55.080> why<00:04:55.320> we

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
so on that's that's that's that's why we

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.439 
so on that's that's that's that's why we
play<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.740> mean<00:04:55.979> it's<00:04:56.160> it's<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.490> horrible<00:04:56.789> job<00:04:57.120> the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
finding its way of isolating yourselves

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.159 
finding its way of isolating yourselves

but there's about a lot of

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.420 
but there's about a lot of
internationals<00:05:13.819> from<00:05:14.060> both<00:05:14.240> sites<00:05:15.249> but<00:05:16.249> yeah

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
internationals from both sites but yeah

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.279 
internationals from both sites but yeah
we<00:05:16.639> know<00:05:16.789> each<00:05:16.909> other<00:05:17.120> very<00:05:17.210> well<00:05:17.449> world<00:05:17.990> ball

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
we know each other very well world ball

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.800 
we know each other very well world ball
from<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.949> few<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.639> us<00:05:19.759> that<00:05:19.819> play<00:05:20.180> international

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
from a few of us that play international

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.510 
from a few of us that play international
against<00:05:21.020> each<00:05:21.169> other<00:05:21.379> and<00:05:21.560> from<00:05:21.919> playing<00:05:22.189> each

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
against each other and from playing each

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.059 
against each other and from playing each
other<00:05:22.669> they<00:05:23.629> get<00:05:23.779> to<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.020> magnas<00:05:24.379> new<00:05:24.560> year<00:05:24.919> in

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
other they get to the magnas new year in

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.709 
other they get to the magnas new year in
year<00:05:25.249> out<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.699> I<00:05:25.759> think<00:05:25.999> might've<00:05:26.240> morning<00:05:26.569> in

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
year out and I think might've morning in

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.260 
year out and I think might've morning in
four<00:05:27.139> years<00:05:27.319> ago<00:05:27.680> we<00:05:27.889> had<00:05:28.069> them<00:05:28.279> in<00:05:28.909> our<00:05:29.060> group

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
four years ago we had them in our group

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.839 
four years ago we had them in our group
in<00:05:29.449> the<00:05:29.479> Heineken<00:05:29.659> Cup<00:05:30.080> as<00:05:30.259> well<00:05:30.469> so<00:05:30.770> yeah<00:05:31.669> we

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
in the Heineken Cup as well so yeah we

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.100 
in the Heineken Cup as well so yeah we
know<00:05:31.999> each<00:05:32.120> other<00:05:32.300> very<00:05:32.389> well<00:05:32.659> and<00:05:32.840> that's

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
know each other very well and that's

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.779 
know each other very well and that's
what<00:05:33.379> I<00:05:33.409> make<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.860> probably<00:05:34.189> an<00:05:34.310> epic<00:05:34.610> battle

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
what I make it probably an epic battle

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.159 
what I make it probably an epic battle
with<00:05:35.379> would<00:05:36.379> probably<00:05:37.360> probably<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.930> know<00:05:38.960> it

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
with would probably probably you know it

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.779 
with would probably probably you know it
might<00:05:39.319> be<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.680> greatest<00:05:39.919> game<00:05:40.189> to<00:05:40.370> watch<00:05:40.520> I'd

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
might be the greatest game to watch I'd

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.089 
might be the greatest game to watch I'd
say<00:05:40.999> because<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:42.229> more<00:05:42.439> you're<00:05:42.620> not<00:05:42.650> teams

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
say because the more you're not teams

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.040 
say because the more you're not teams
know<00:05:43.370> each<00:05:43.400> other<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.939> less<00:05:43.969> chance<00:05:44.389> you<00:05:44.870> have

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
know each other the less chance you have

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.149 
know each other the less chance you have
of<00:05:45.879> breaking<00:05:46.879> windows<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.979> that<00:05:48.979> will

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159
