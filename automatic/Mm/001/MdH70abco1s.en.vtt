00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.650
 at startup, plo 1 uses 15 to 45 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.960
 I'm starting to think because they're so 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.029
 Standard variant of every body shooter 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.560
 used on but you may have to 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.850
 Do not start on tiptoe like 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.970
 increase the power a bit more 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.140
 But it is definitely not a must 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.010
 try the ball slightly below the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 middle to meet 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.280
 this gives the ball more topspin 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.470
 so easily bypasses the wall kilo 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.600
 connects the inside of his foot 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.820
 There are two options on the one hand 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.100
 You can behead more, that is, more 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.080
 on the other hand, effet also has something 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.590
 more power I have you both way times 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.930
 shown briefly on a football boot 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.760
 Overall, april uses a lot 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.820
 quiet start only in the last step 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.680
 builds up his power though piano 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.479
 his leg does not jump so extremely through 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.820
 the other football play the also the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.890
 mastering effet ball gets his 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.260
 ball and his wrong too very much 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.729
 much effet and body and that too 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.810
 maybe the difficult but also that 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.810
 special about his technique 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
 more 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.380
 hopped 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.530
 this one can
