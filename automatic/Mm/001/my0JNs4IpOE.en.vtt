get<00:02:11.549> brighter<00:02:11.790> dark<00:02:12.450> sides<00:02:12.690> go<00:02:12.959> darker<00:02:13.650> and

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
get brighter dark sides go darker and

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.979 
get brighter dark sides go darker and
you've<00:02:14.579> got<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.790> focus<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> because

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
you've got your focus and because

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.140 
you've got your focus and because
there's<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.380> split<00:02:16.620> prism<00:02:17.070> inside<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:18.030> get

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
there's a split prism inside you can get

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.849 
there's a split prism inside you can get
really<00:02:18.359> accurate<00:02:18.480> focus<00:02:19.019> with<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.290> lovely

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
really accurate focus with this lovely

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.910 
really accurate focus with this lovely
depth<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.160> field<00:02:20.480> although<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.600> an<00:02:21.690> f/8<00:02:22.019> it's

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
depth of field although it's an f/8 it's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.810 
depth of field although it's an f/8 it's
actually<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.109> bigger<00:02:25.410> format<00:02:25.890> than<00:02:26.220> 6/6

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
actually it's a bigger format than 6/6

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.330 
actually it's a bigger format than 6/6
so<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.390> get<00:02:27.540> really<00:02:27.750> nice<00:02:27.900> tup<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.320> field

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.960 

only<00:02:32.340> looks<00:02:32.609> really<00:02:32.970> fun<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> focused<00:02:33.720> there

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
only looks really fun and focused there

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.729 
only looks really fun and focused there
it's<00:02:35.970> got<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> nice<00:02:36.390> aluminum<00:02:36.780> finish<00:02:37.290> as<00:02:37.560> well

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
it's got a nice aluminum finish as well

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.710 
it's got a nice aluminum finish as well
sort<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.600> polished<00:02:39.600> aluminium<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:41.359> on<00:02:42.359> top

sort of polished aluminium and on top

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.990 
sort of polished aluminium and on top
here<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.859> slightly<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.670> put<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
here on the slightly you can put a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.270 
here on the slightly you can put a
filter<00:02:45.299> in<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.319> shoot<00:02:46.530> 600

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
filter in there so you can shoot 600

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.490 
filter in there so you can shoot 600
film<00:02:48.030> as<00:02:48.209> well

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
film as well

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.220 
film as well
got<00:02:50.040> some<00:02:50.220> shots<00:02:50.460> here<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> show<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:52.020> is

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
got some shots here to show you this is

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.350 
got some shots here to show you this is
on<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.560> color<00:02:53.010> protection<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.000> new<00:02:54.120> film

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
on the color protection the new film

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.660 
on the color protection the new film
they've<00:02:54.510> got<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.290> black<00:02:55.650> border

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
they've got this is black border

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.660 
they've got this is black border
silver<00:02:58.250> silver<00:02:59.250> shade<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.820> got<00:03:00.750> some<00:03:00.930> more<00:03:01.670> two

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
silver silver shade I got some more two

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.670 
silver silver shade I got some more two
shots<00:03:02.940> here<00:03:03.060> from<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.660> color<00:03:04.200> protection

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
shots here from the color protection

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.450 
shots here from the color protection
film<00:03:05.930> with<00:03:06.930> these<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:08.010> they're<00:03:08.340> actually

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
film with these because they're actually

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.420 
film with these because they're actually
more<00:03:09.120> sensitive<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.750> light<00:03:09.780> they<00:03:10.440> over<00:03:11.040> expose

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
more sensitive to light they over expose

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.730 
more sensitive to light they over expose
so<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.150> put<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.510> slider<00:03:12.840> down<00:03:13.320> to

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
so you have to put the slider down to

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.070 
so you have to put the slider down to
about<00:03:13.920> two-thirds<00:03:14.700> with<00:03:15.000> stop<00:03:15.210> lower<00:03:20.990> but<00:03:21.990> the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
about two-thirds with stop lower but the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.430 
about two-thirds with stop lower but the
only<00:03:22.230> problem<00:03:22.440> with<00:03:22.740> this<00:03:22.890> one<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:24.290> when<00:03:25.290> you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
only problem with this one is when you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.250 
only problem with this one is when you
when<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.160> close<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.910> camera<00:03:27.150> down<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:28.050> will

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
when you close the camera down it will

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.550 
when you close the camera down it will
reset<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.820> middle<00:03:30.060> again<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:31.140> every<00:03:31.380> time

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
reset to the middle again so every time

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.810 
reset to the middle again so every time
you<00:03:31.650> open<00:03:31.710> up<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> camera<00:03:32.250> you've<00:03:32.550> got<00:03:32.730> to

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
you open up the camera you've got to

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.460 
you open up the camera you've got to
remember<00:03:33.000> you've<00:03:33.450> got<00:03:33.480> more<00:03:33.810> sensitive<00:03:34.290> film

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
remember you've got more sensitive film

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.080 
remember you've got more sensitive film
in<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.010> then<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.460> change<00:03:35.730> that

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
in there and then just change that

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:52.070 
in there and then just change that
exposure<00:03:36.600> down<00:03:36.900> like<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:50.210> so<00:03:51.210> I<00:03:51.240> mostly<00:03:51.750> keep

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
exposure down like that so I mostly keep

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.170 
exposure down like that so I mostly keep
this<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.710> ever<00:03:52.920> already<00:03:53.130> case<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:54.120> you

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
this and it's ever already case so you

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.790 
this and it's ever already case so you
just<00:03:54.420> open<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.780> up<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.110> shoot<00:03:55.350> straight<00:03:55.530> away

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
just open it up and shoot straight away

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.640 
just open it up and shoot straight away
I<00:03:56.510> find<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.630> bit<00:03:57.750> more<00:03:57.900> convenient<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.500> have

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
I find it a bit more convenient to have

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.360 
I find it a bit more convenient to have
it<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.890> my<00:03:59.310> side<00:03:59.550> rather<00:04:00.090> than<00:04:00.240> in<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.420> bag

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
it on my side rather than in the bag

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.960 
it on my side rather than in the bag
and<00:04:02.450> when<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.480> was<00:04:03.750> rescanning<00:04:04.320> this<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:05.700> does

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
and when I was rescanning this it does

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.810 
and when I was rescanning this it does
take<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.300> long<00:04:06.600> time<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.550> do<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.580> bit<00:04:08.790> of

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
take a long time and do a bit of

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.910 
take a long time and do a bit of
research<00:04:09.110> because<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.200> can't<00:04:10.440> make<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.620> big

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
research because you can't make a big

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.440 
research because you can't make a big
mess<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.610> you're<00:04:11.730> not<00:04:11.820> careful<00:04:12.030> I

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
mess of this if you're not careful I

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.480 
mess of this if you're not careful I
ended<00:04:13.050> up<00:04:13.080> having<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.410> use<00:04:13.650> petrol<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.340> put

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
ended up having to use petrol to put

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.849 
ended up having to use petrol to put
some<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:14.850> on<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.270> thought<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:16.770> like

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
some of this on I thought I go for like

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.590 
some of this on I thought I go for like
a<00:04:16.890> tan<00:04:17.270> dark<00:04:18.270> brown<00:04:18.540> blue<00:04:20.299> if<00:04:21.299> you've<00:04:21.450> ever

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
little bit sad but I think it looks

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.840 
little bit sad but I think it looks
quite<00:04:25.350> cool<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.860> same<00:04:26.130> sort<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.400> style<00:04:26.670> as

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
quite cool the same sort of style as

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:38.620 
quite cool the same sort of style as
