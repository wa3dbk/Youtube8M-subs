00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.780
 hello everyone good I'll move on 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.780
 explain what it consists of 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.960
 is a web page design using 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.570
 pixels or through percentages I'm going to 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.360
 do a small demonstration now 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.460
 same and you will see the clear 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.880
 differences between a thing and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.400
 another good I have created here a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.369
 desktop a file that is contains 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.609
 good funds I'm going to edit it I'm going to put 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.609
 tests 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.210
 and I'm going to edit it and I'm going to edit it with 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.170
 dreamweaver driver is an editor of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.390
 texts that I use to program 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.309
 that for me is right now of the 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.129
 best in the market but good 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.800
 anyone could be worth it, I'm going to edit it 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.050
 with this you are going to see first I am going to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.470
 explain how it is structured and 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.990
 then let's see 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.960
 all right 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.830
 here I have done two tests first 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.170
 I have styles using pixels and 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.790
 by percentages the only thing that changes 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.670
 here is simply this figure here 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.590
 we have 980 pixels and here we have a 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.630
 40% 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.470
 this is the big difference and what are you going 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.210
 to both of you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.930
 and then we have the structuring down 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.970
 the body with a page is worth a page 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.710
 that wraps what is the head er the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.050
 body that inside the body wraps the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.240
 left column the right column and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.920
 we had the footer then here we have 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 Well, the styles I've made 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.120
 duplication of styles to go more 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.490
 Quick 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.350
 I mention this and I have right now 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.730
 created these styles through 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.940
 percentages 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.160
 first of all I will explain to you 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.160
 pixel pixel is better 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.039
 they are very well it depends for what things I 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.880
 for example now I'm not very supportive 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.820
 to use pixels more than anything because every 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.229
 once in the statistics they say that the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090
 mobile phones are more used than 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.509
 computers then clear people 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 when he is at home he is very 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.740
 likely to be viewing your web page at 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 through a mobile this has a lot 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.060
 importance because we have to 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.160
 be aware that we must adapt 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.650
 our website to devices 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.420
 mobile and not just fish 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.700
 screen dimensions that has a 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.739
 mobile device are logically a lot 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.390
 lower than a pc then this 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.400
 all this we have to have 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.049
 us in our mind at the time of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.740
 schedule a web page and do the 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.380
 design right now 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.870
 all right 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.180
 I'm going to explain to you a little bit what it is that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.000
 I have made myself first created the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.480
 structuring as I have told you we have 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.650
 the body together with its elements and of and 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.150
 then we create the styles 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.370
 I have put the styles 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.440
 directly in this file by going a 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.990
 little faster but you can do us 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.240
 put a css file and here link carlo 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.620
 there are not any problems I have 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.810
 made directly here for ya I say 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.150
 to go faster 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.770
 here the post styles using 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.860
 good pixels 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.160
 you're going to see that not all are pixels I 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.440
 I do is combine but rather to 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.500
 body you always have to put a hundred 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.920
 One hundred is worth the way I do it 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.570
 you could do it using pixels 980 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.950
 pixels and avoid this video 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.590
 avoid page and directly to the body 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.600
 put it 980 pixels I have the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.390
 custom of doing it like this always 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.120
 of generation by a hundred and then already 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.610
 structure myself 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.220
 l got it in 980 pixels I came out from 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.620
 page that the one that returns to head the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.569
 body and footer 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.799
 this so you can see it better I'm going to 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.799
 put well structure 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.590
 moody inside you can page on page 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.630
 this and inside the body this then you 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.120
 has gotten general styles and the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.390
 result of this would follow the next 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.390
 with chrome 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.540
 is loading in mass would seem like this 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.099
 Ok it looks good as we can see but 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.719
 what's happening we're seeing it well in a 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.909
 screen of thousand 360 pixels then no 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.489
 it's worth it because because if we 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.850
 we make the following check the way 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.669
 it looks good still good still good 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.840
 still fine still in still but what 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.770
 he's saving to the limit 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.150
 the one who called above all those adopted 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.690
 this is a mobile screen like 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.690
 we can see 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.970
 these dimensions is a screen of 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.670
 mobile 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.620
 this is a 10 tablet screen 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.900
 inches is still looking bad 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.020
 because we have to create for the right 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.050
 it looks bad it looks bad 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.530
 now it looks good then it's worth it 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.849
 where do I go we have to adapt this 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.660
 we have to adapt it and we also have 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.250
 to adapt it by percentages 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.440
 so you can see the difference with the 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.440
 percentages commented on this 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.320
 I put this here the difference in the 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.340
 next I have 40% I'm going to put 50 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.470
 so that it's more like 980 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.240
 I have 50% the only difference 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.460
 this number 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.199
 of this one 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.199
 ok i keep 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.700
 I come back 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.700
 here I update 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.229
 I'm minimizing 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.610
 I'm already in the foundation of the tablet of 10 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.529
 inches is still looking smaller 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.659
 because it's normal but you can still see 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.449
 thus minimizing organizing and 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.449
 minimizing I go towards mobile I'm going towards 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.199
 mobile 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.699
 what happens is no longer hidden, that is to say 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.910
 you can still see the dimensions of 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.430
 mobile 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.340
 but you still see everything is not followed 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.750
 seeing only red then this is very 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.000
 important because here the only thing 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.770
 we do is adapt our page to 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.230
 all dimensions not only for 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.040
 mobile we are adapting the both for 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.960
 iPad devices as you can 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.290
 propositives of the mobile tablet pcs 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.180
 portable is all kinds of dimensions 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.220
 in addition there are more ways logically of 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.710
 doing it using pixels is also 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.310
 could but good this is a design 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.310
 general structuring 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.060
 for all screen dimensions 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.910
 it is simply this that I wanted you 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.370
 comment if you have any kind of doubt 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.960
 you hesitate to enter my page www studies 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.180
 web dot is 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.430
 and I can solve all those doubts 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.600
 that you have many thanks for watching this 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.600
 video tutorial and until another
