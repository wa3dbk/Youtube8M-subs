hey guys welcome to this week's episode

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.280 
hey guys welcome to this week's episode
of<00:00:01.800> blunder<00:00:02.460> explained<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.300> this<00:00:03.570> episode<00:00:04.080> I'm

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
of blunder explained in this episode I'm

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.230 
of blunder explained in this episode I'm
going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> be<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.740> over<00:00:05.040> drivers<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.940> how

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
going to be going over drivers and how

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.020 
going to be going over drivers and how
to<00:00:06.299> use<00:00:06.480> them<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.589> driver<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.250> basically<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
to use them so a driver is basically a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.480 
to use them so a driver is basically a
way<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.679> control<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:12.049> value<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.380> an<00:00:13.799> object<00:00:14.340> by

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
way to control a value on an object by

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
way to control a value on an object by
using<00:00:14.820> another<00:00:15.150> object<00:00:15.450> as<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> variable<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
using another object as a variable to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.279 
using another object as a variable to
that<00:00:16.980> value<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.660> in<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.750> case<00:00:18.960> we're<00:00:19.170> going

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
that value so in this case we're going

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.279 
that value so in this case we're going
to<00:00:19.350> be<00:00:19.439> using<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.580> Y<00:00:21.300> location<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:22.020> this

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
to be using the Y location of this

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.519 
to be using the Y location of this
object<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.789> rotate<00:00:24.390> these<00:00:24.779> wheels<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> x

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
object to rotate these wheels on the x

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.130 
object to rotate these wheels on the x
axis<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.160> we're<00:00:26.970> gonna<00:00:27.090> select<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.630> wheel<00:00:27.810> and

value of maximum value all of those will
do<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> same<00:01:18.210> thing<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.200> one

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
do the same thing if we just have one

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.300 
do the same thing if we just have one
variable<00:01:21.650> except<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.860> scripted<00:01:23.250> expression

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
variable except for scripted expression

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.560 
variable except for scripted expression
which<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.750> let<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.340> type<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.790> script

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
which will just let you type in a script

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.969 
which will just let you type in a script
script<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.060> small<00:01:30.060> Python<00:01:30.299> expression<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
script or a small Python expression to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.359 
script or a small Python expression to
control<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.759> variable<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:34.079> basically<00:01:35.070> what

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
control the variable but basically what

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.300 
control the variable but basically what
we<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.380> select<00:01:37.380> average<00:01:37.950> values

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
we want to do is select average values

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
we want to do is select average values
what<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> select<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:39.710> select

what I'm going to select and then select
the<00:01:40.920> Y<00:01:41.159> location<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.329> should<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.659> good

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the Y location and that should be good

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.440 
the Y location and that should be good
so<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.189> select<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.850> select<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> car

all right so now
if<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:14.269> select<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.440> car<00:02:15.650> as<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.519> can<00:02:16.700> see<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
if we select a car as you can see the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.820 
if we select a car as you can see the
wheel<00:02:17.510> both<00:02:17.870> wheels<00:02:18.140> rotate<00:02:18.680> with<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.920> car<00:02:19.190> so

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
wheel both wheels rotate with the car so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.920 
wheel both wheels rotate with the car so
those<00:02:21.830> are<00:02:22.069> drivers<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.700> also<00:02:23.060> do<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> lot

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
those are drivers you can also do a lot

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.289 
those are drivers you can also do a lot
more<00:02:24.230> than<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:27.489> location<00:02:28.489> rotation<00:02:28.940> and

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
more than just location rotation and

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.750 
more than just location rotation and
scale<00:02:29.540> here<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.709> if<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> want<00:02:31.159> to<00:02:31.220> change<00:02:31.489> it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
scale here so if you want to change it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.600 
scale here so if you want to change it
to<00:02:32.090> single<00:02:32.450> property<00:02:33.049> there<00:02:33.680> are<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.950> bunch<00:02:34.430> of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
to single property there are a bunch of

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.160 
to single property there are a bunch of
more<00:02:35.180> types<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.440> can<00:02:36.620> control<00:02:37.040> your

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
more types that you can control your

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.080 
more types that you can control your
object<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:41.060> also<00:02:41.690> there's<00:02:42.379> distance

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
object with and also there's distance

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.349 
object with and also there's distance
rational<00:02:44.090> difference<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.750> those<00:02:45.230> deal<00:02:45.920> with

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
rational difference and those deal with

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.210 
rational difference and those deal with
multiple<00:02:47.359> variables<00:02:48.170> I'm<00:02:48.410> pretty<00:02:48.739> sure<00:02:48.920> or<00:02:49.190> I

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
multiple variables I'm pretty sure or I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.490 
multiple variables I'm pretty sure or I
guess<00:02:50.000> bones<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.810> case<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:53.470> we're<00:02:54.470> just

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
guess bones in this case so we're just

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.559 
guess bones in this case so we're just
using<00:02:54.739> transform<00:02:55.190> channel<00:02:55.549> this<00:02:55.640> time<00:02:55.700> but

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
using transform channel this time but

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.809 
using transform channel this time but
those<00:02:57.260> are<00:02:57.410> drivers<00:02:57.769> thanks<00:02:58.250> for<00:02:58.370> watching

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
those are drivers thanks for watching

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.019 
those are drivers thanks for watching
and<00:02:59.090> I'll<00:02:59.510> see<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.750> next<00:02:59.810> time
