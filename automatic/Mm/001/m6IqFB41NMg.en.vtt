00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
towards the first and second week of

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.620 
towards the first and second week of

October before it comes out it is very

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.180 
October before it comes out it is very
possible<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.410> could<00:01:32.560> come<00:01:32.770> out<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.980> very

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
possible that it could come out the very

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.010 
possible that it could come out the very
last<00:01:33.340> week<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.730> September<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:34.510> I<00:01:34.690> highly

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
last week of September but I highly

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.080 
last week of September but I highly
doubt<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.440> considering<00:01:36.400> they<00:01:36.580> haven't<00:01:36.910> put<00:01:37.060> it

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
doubt it considering they haven't put it

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.950 
doubt it considering they haven't put it
into<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.300> cert<00:01:37.540> test<00:01:37.750> yet<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:40.000> order<00:01:40.780> for<00:01:40.870> him

into the cert test yet in order for him

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.050 
into the cert test yet in order for him
to<00:01:41.050> come<00:01:41.290> out<00:01:41.440> last<00:01:42.100> week<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.610> September
