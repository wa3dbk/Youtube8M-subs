wheels<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> come<00:00:55.170> off<00:00:55.350> set<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.520> really

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
wheels do you come off set if you really

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.979 
wheels do you come off set if you really
want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> even<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.390> where<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.809> wheels

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
right you could flip them but I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.459 
right you could flip them but I

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
personally recommend just rotating your

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229 
personally recommend just rotating your
wheels<00:01:01.649> cuz<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.070> notice<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> slight

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
wheels cuz it will notice just a slight

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
wheels cuz it will notice just a slight
difference<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> wheel<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
difference in the wheel that's how I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.120 
difference in the wheel that's how I
just<00:01:05.129> put<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.400> deals<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:06.350> after<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.530> two

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
just put these deals on after about two

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.060 
just put these deals on after about two
