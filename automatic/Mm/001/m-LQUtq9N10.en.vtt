quality pictures in low light and this

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.320 
quality pictures in low light and this
is<00:04:44.830> something<00:04:45.009> that<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.759> g11<00:04:45.969> is

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
is something that the the g11 is

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.600 
is something that the the g11 is
striving<00:04:46.719> to<00:04:46.960> do<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:47.889> think<00:04:47.949> perhaps<00:04:48.280> this

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
striving to do and I think perhaps this

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.909 
striving to do and I think perhaps this
is<00:04:48.759> a<00:04:48.930> nail<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.139> coffin<00:04:50.169> of<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.740> more
