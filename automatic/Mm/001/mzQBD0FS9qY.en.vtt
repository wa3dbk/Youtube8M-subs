00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030 

now<00:00:00.930> we're<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.199> go<00:00:01.319> through<00:00:01.350> dribbling

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
now we're going to go through dribbling

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.400 
now we're going to go through dribbling
and<00:00:02.760> when<00:00:02.909> we<00:00:03.000> dribble<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:03.990> don't<00:00:04.110> dribble

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
and when we dribble we don't dribble

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.280 
and when we dribble we don't dribble
with<00:00:04.710> our<00:00:04.980> toe<00:00:05.509> because<00:00:06.509> we<00:00:06.629> lose<00:00:06.779> control<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
with our toe because we lose control the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.350 
with our toe because we lose control the
ball<00:00:07.500> we<00:00:08.340> don't<00:00:08.490> dribble<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.179> because

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
ball we don't dribble like this because

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.930 
ball we don't dribble like this because
it's<00:00:09.510> very<00:00:09.599> hard<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.900> run<00:00:10.200> at<00:00:10.440> full<00:00:11.370> speed<00:00:11.700> like

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
it's very hard to run at full speed like

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.089 
it's very hard to run at full speed like
that<00:00:12.179> but<00:00:13.110> we're<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> teach<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.860> few

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
that but we're going to teach a few

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.310 
that but we're going to teach a few
different<00:00:14.190> ways<00:00:14.519> through<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> cones<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.660> how

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
different ways through the cones of how

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.960 
different ways through the cones of how
to<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.650> build<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.369> what<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.580> want<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> do<00:00:17.880> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
to just build up what we want to do is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.660 
to just build up what we want to do is
we<00:00:18.060> want<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.270> build<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.250> ability<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.550> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
we want to build up the ability to be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.269 
we want to build up the ability to be
able<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.029> dribble<00:00:21.210> at<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> slow<00:00:21.720> pace<00:00:21.980> to<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
able to dribble at a slow pace to get it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.820 
able to dribble at a slow pace to get it
into<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.550> run<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.869> into<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.289> run<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
into a run to get it into a run to a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
into a run to get it into a run to a
faster<00:00:26.369> run<00:00:26.550> almost<00:00:26.760> into<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> sprint<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:28.170> when

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
faster run almost into a sprint but when

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.630 
faster run almost into a sprint but when
we<00:00:28.349> dribble<00:00:28.680> we've<00:00:28.800> got<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> cone<00:00:29.250> setup<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we dribble we've got the cone setup and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.710 
we dribble we've got the cone setup and
it's<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:29.970> very<00:00:30.029> simple<00:00:30.480> we're<00:00:30.599> going

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it's going to be very simple we're going

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
it's going to be very simple we're going
to<00:00:30.779> use<00:00:30.960> almost<00:00:31.380> we're<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> use<00:00:31.859> try<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to use almost we're going to use try to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
to use almost we're going to use try to
use<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.550> used<00:00:32.730> earlier<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> passing

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
use what we used earlier with a passing

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.270 
use what we used earlier with a passing
technique<00:00:33.870> we're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> pass<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> ball

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
technique we're going to pass the ball

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.740 
technique we're going to pass the ball
through<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:36.000> we're<00:00:36.660> going

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
through here with the right we're going

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.600 
through here with the right we're going
to<00:00:36.840> come<00:00:36.960> back<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> left<00:00:37.860> here

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
to come back here with the left here

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.220 
to come back here with the left here
with<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.120> left<00:00:40.100> right<00:00:41.100> left<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:43.110> we

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
with the right left right left and we

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860 
with the right left right left and we
come<00:00:43.410> back<00:00:43.610> that's<00:00:44.610> where<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.690> way

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
come back that's where we that's one way

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.500 
come back that's where we that's one way
of<00:00:45.899> doing<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.410> we're<00:00:46.500> using<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.100> way

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
of doing it and we're using this way

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
of doing it and we're using this way
right<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:48.899> using<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.320> left<00:00:49.910> but<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.059> we

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
right and we're using the left but if we

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
right and we're using the left but if we
want<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.539> specific<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.190> with

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
want to be specific we can do this with

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
want to be specific we can do this with
right<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.210> foot<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
right with one foot and we can do it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.630 
right with one foot and we can do it
with<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> right<00:00:55.680> foot<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.250> pass<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
with the right foot because we pass it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
with the right foot because we pass it
through<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.870> we'll<00:00:57.989> pass<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> ball

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
through here so we'll pass the ball

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
through here so we'll pass the ball
through<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.579> here<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.300> we'll

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
through this here in here and then we'll

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
through this here in here and then we'll
dribble<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> outside<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.520> we'll

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
dribble back with the outside then we'll

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
dribble back with the outside then we'll
come<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.690> foot<00:01:03.719> inside

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
come in here with the right foot inside

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
come in here with the right foot inside
and<00:01:04.949> we're<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.369> outside<00:01:05.909> we're<00:01:06.689> going

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and we're going outside we're going

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800 
and we're going outside we're going
inside<00:01:07.340> we're<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.610> outside<00:01:09.180> that's<00:01:09.570> we

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
inside we're going outside that's we

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
inside we're going outside that's we
work<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.439> foot<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.580> back

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
work on the right foot then we go back

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.490 
work on the right foot then we go back
and<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> left<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:13.229> push

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and we do it with the left we push

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
and we do it with the left we push
through<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.299> push

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
through here this way then we push

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
through here this way then we push
through<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:16.350> we're<00:01:16.950> coming

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
through here this way we're coming

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.940 
through here this way we're coming
through<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.090> we're<00:01:18.240> using<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> inside

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
through what we're using the inside

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
through what we're using the inside
we're<00:01:19.950> using<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> outside<00:01:20.580> we're<00:01:21.210> pushing

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
we're using the outside we're pushing

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.990 
we're using the outside we're pushing
the<00:01:21.570> ball<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.960> inside<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.790> pushing

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the ball in the inside and we're pushing

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140 
the ball in the inside and we're pushing
to<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> outside<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.710> dribble<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.939> if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
to the outside so when we dribble and if

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.039 
to the outside so when we dribble and if
you<00:01:27.240> stand<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.540> i'll<00:01:27.659> show<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> little

you stand there i'll show you a little
bit<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.979> stand<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.340> front<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> ball

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
bit will stand in front of the ball

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.660 
bit will stand in front of the ball
because<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.799> can't<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> ball<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.610> you

that's<00:01:46.229> when<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.380> dribble<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> do

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that's when we dribble we're going to do

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
that's when we dribble we're going to do
head<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.490> balls<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.420> front<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.869> is

what we want to be able to do I can look

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.100 
what we want to be able to do I can look
at<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> camera<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.570> always<00:01:51.810> where

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
at the camera and I know always where

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.530 
at the camera and I know always where
the<00:01:52.170> ball<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.350> okay<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.909> that's<00:01:54.090> part<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the ball is okay so that's part of the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
the ball is okay so that's part of the
trick<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:56.310> trying<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> dribble<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> then

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
trick of of trying to dribble but then

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
trick of of trying to dribble but then
we<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.210> again<00:02:00.450> we're<00:02:01.170> only<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> use<00:02:01.530> two

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
we go again we're only going to use two

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
we go again we're only going to use two
parts<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.219> our<00:02:02.340> feet<00:02:02.549> we're<00:02:03.329> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> use

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
parts of our feet we're going to use

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.800 
parts of our feet we're going to use
this<00:02:04.500> side<00:02:05.210> because<00:02:06.210> we're<00:02:06.360> dribbling<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810

the<00:02:22.440> passing<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> dribbling<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the passing is here the dribbling is the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.420 
the passing is here the dribbling is the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
same thing here here and then we're

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.550 
same thing here here and then we're
bending<00:02:26.610> here<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:27.989> here<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:30.410> here<00:02:31.410> and

here<00:02:31.970> that's<00:02:32.970> what<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.269> try<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.480> use<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.720> even

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
here that's what we try to use it even

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.180 
here that's what we try to use it even
from<00:02:33.959> behind<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.380> can<00:02:34.500> still<00:02:34.709> see<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.950> this

come back push come back you can see
that<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:48.480> beauty<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.870> dribbling<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:51.030> can

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
that the beauty of dribbling as you can

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.240 
that the beauty of dribbling as you can
use<00:02:51.269> any<00:02:51.510> part<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.840> your<00:02:51.930> feet<00:02:52.200> long<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
use any part of your feet long as the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.100 
use any part of your feet long as the
ball<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.549> front<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.970> born<00:02:54.780> thing<00:02:54.989> is

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
ball is in front of you born thing is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.900 
ball is in front of you born thing is
always<00:02:55.260> look<00:02:55.530> forward<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.640> be<00:02:56.730> under

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
always look forward and to be under

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.850 
always look forward and to be under
control<00:02:57.080> because<00:02:58.080> dribbling<00:02:58.560> isn't<00:02:58.739> about

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
control because dribbling isn't about

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.059 
control because dribbling isn't about
kicking<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> ball<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:01.470> ball<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.860> far

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
kicking the ball the ball is that far

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.199 
kicking the ball the ball is that far
ahead<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.280> me<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.549> there's<00:03:02.670> nobody<00:03:03.180> else

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209

around<00:03:03.390> me<00:03:03.599> in<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.780> field<00:03:03.989> that's<00:03:04.980> okay<00:03:05.959> but

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
around me in the field that's okay but

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.350 
around me in the field that's okay but
if<00:03:07.140> there's<00:03:07.319> somebody<00:03:07.560> around<00:03:07.830> me<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:09.150> ball

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
if there's somebody around me the ball

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.250 
if there's somebody around me the ball
shouldn't<00:03:09.599> be<00:03:09.660> any<00:03:09.810> further<00:03:09.959> than<00:03:10.200> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
shouldn't be any further than that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.460 
shouldn't be any further than that
because<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.549> see<00:03:11.700> there<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.140> can<00:03:13.140> see<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.319> guy

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.170 
because I can see there I can see a guy
in<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.709> distance<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.640> know<00:03:14.700> my<00:03:14.910> balls

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
in the distance and I know my balls

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.240 
in the distance and I know my balls
right<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.750> I'll<00:03:15.840> back<00:03:16.019> up<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.799> I'll

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
right there so I'll back up and I'll

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.190 
right there so I'll back up and I'll
stare<00:03:17.459> at<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.609> camera<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.000> whole<00:03:18.120> time<00:03:18.200> and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
stare at the camera the whole time and

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.020 
stare at the camera the whole time and
i'll<00:03:19.980> still<00:03:20.100> be<00:03:20.280> able<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.459> dribble<00:03:20.609> my<00:03:20.820> ball

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
i'll still be able to dribble my ball

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.080 
i'll still be able to dribble my ball
under<00:03:21.840> control<00:03:22.260> because<00:03:23.160> i<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.670> out<00:03:23.760> far

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
under control because i have it out far

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.750 
under control because i have it out far
enough<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.620> i<00:03:25.650> don't<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.130> look<00:03:26.400> down<00:03:26.549> this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
enough so i don't have to look down this

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.340 
enough so i don't have to look down this
is<00:03:26.940> not<00:03:27.090> dribbling<00:03:27.480> because<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.230> know<00:03:28.320> what

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
is not dribbling because you know what

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.160 
is not dribbling because you know what
if<00:03:28.620> i<00:03:28.799> do<00:03:28.859> this<00:03:29.100> i<00:03:29.450> may<00:03:30.450> run<00:03:30.660> into<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.959> camera

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
if i do this i may run into the camera

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.650 
if i do this i may run into the camera
and<00:03:31.500> that's<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.310> good<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:33.269> that's<00:03:33.329> the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
and that's not good and that's the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.599 
and that's not good and that's the
important<00:03:33.989> thing<00:03:34.049> when<00:03:34.290> we<00:03:34.410> dribble<00:03:34.799> head<00:03:35.430> up

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
important thing when we dribble head up
