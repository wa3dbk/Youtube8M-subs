00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:44.969
 taipan is the most poisonous snake in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.460

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 class this mouse belongs to an expert in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.040
 In general, there are more stickers there. 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 In short, I have 6 pairs of these on glue 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:45.829
 keyboard that with a keyboard 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.539
 she also belongs to the expert class 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.579
 green lights like a mouse mouse 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.759
 she pulsates then you can 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.000
 make it pulsing there is a button 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:04.530
 Macro and game recordings 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.679

 response time is 1 millisecond and here it is 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.329
 rug itself 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.160
 what I can not say it seems that the mouse 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:35.549
 will quickly wear off but it's not 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:41.519
 plastic public pretty now he 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:43.709
 quite so nice to the touch and here 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.269
 These are the teflon legs of the mouse 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:54.630
 will be erased and like that 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:03:00.200
 let's get to the keyboard and mouse itself 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:05.340
 similar in general here and so looks 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 the keyboard itself here palm rest 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.000

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:17.880

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.139
 carbon that's what i said pulsing u 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:28.250
 She icon design is very convenient for all 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:28.250
 grip types with my fingers 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.650
 so here 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.150
 in general, I can say it is still 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.350
 will support 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:51.000
 it supports razer software razer 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:55.200
 synapse 20 mouse and keyboard sound 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.690
 She is so good at mouse cry me 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:04.220

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.220
 battlefield 3 and the usual bad company 2 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:11.840
 low profile keyboard in style 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.490
 the laptop is done that is it not 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.140
 mechanical not membrane that is with us 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.440
 there is a functional key and here it is more 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:27.900
 niche illumination gaming mod lighting 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:32.040
 macro recording and so on 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:40.560
 say the backlight is very nice well in 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:43.680
 Generally, this software is our setting. 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.970
 keyboard and here are the mouse settings 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.730
 day is 1800 now everything is in general 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.919
 at the mouth 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:05:02.880
 now i will pause the recordings turn off 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:04.410
 flash and show how it is without flash 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.000
 glows because with 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.000
 flash hinders 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:21.110
 even close the curtains so that you can see better 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.110
 Illumination all such suspend 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:31.650
 I keep writing everything and that's how it is 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:35.820
 lights look generally in the dark we 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.910
 Yesterday the final evening I was completely stunned 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.640

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:52.980
 so dark green cool backlight and in 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:58.800

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.770
