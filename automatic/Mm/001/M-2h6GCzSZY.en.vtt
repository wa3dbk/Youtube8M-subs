 for youtube it's the pick szeged and 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.150
 Welcome to this vehicle guide of 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.950
 the attachments in this case of the jets 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.300
 or reaction cases is a screen 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.530
 interactive can click on 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.150
 anyone in any of the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.220
 attachments and will take them to the video 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.900
 corresponding if the guide is online 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.430
 if not then you can subscribe to 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.710
 also the subscribe button also 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.509
 it works also we are going to upload other 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.880
 vehicles finishing the reaction hunt 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.349
 if they liked the video or it was useful to them 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.119
 final please give me like 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.070
 subscribe so you do not miss any 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.660
 episode and let's start with the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.090
 heat seekers that is the episode 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.860
 of this week that are the search engines of 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.330
 heat for first first first what 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.160
 are the heat seekers are two 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.850
 missiles can be equipped as weapons 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.770
 high schools 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.930
 apart from the main gun barrel 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.630
 that they have of the submachine gun that they have 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.610
 the jet for example and can be equipped 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.170
 in any type of jet that is, 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.210
 jet fighters or aircraft 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.390
 type toner ball of fort hood that can 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.730
 find in rolls what is the use of these 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.710
 missiles once you get in the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 objective you can shoot the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.439
 missiles are going to follow the enemy either 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.450
 plane or helicopter since you can not no 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.380
 you can look at something else that is not 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.060
 flying 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.170
 that is, even if you see a tank flying 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.810
 You can not fix him rather me 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.390
 I mean helicopters and jets this 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 addition is itself the first 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.549
 they unlock though it is the second 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.229
 addition that in theory is unlocked to 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.640
 what do I mean that obviously the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.079
 flares if you have not seen the episode 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.210
 previous can look for it in the channel 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.420
 even according to this one week ago the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.039
 video of the flares do not require 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.030
 points to be unlocked so 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.670
 so much is unlocked from the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.700
 principle and what are the missiles 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.490
 it would be the next addition available 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.970
 that is unlocked with 1,200 points 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.770
 actions within the jet is to say all 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.990
 the points all the deaths all that 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.580
 do inside a jet is going to count towards 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.220
 that rating and once we 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.640
 together the 1200 will have the search engines 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.289
 of heat ok let's see how it is used 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.569
 here I have my little script because it 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.659
 they ask how this is used is very 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.819
 easy done with it what is pc 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.920
 you can change the weapons one is for the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.870
 main cannon for the machine gun and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.489
 two is for the secondary missile 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.030
 possibly the missiles are either the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.520
 missiles 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.890
 or what would be the heat seekers 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.510
 well here they change to number two they will have 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 your heat sight once you are in the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.340
 range more or less a little close but 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.959
 not as close as you more or less 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.819
 and to achieve is not a precise distance 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.000
 generally laying this changes the 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.190
 of the patch and others but once they are 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.040
 a certain distance that they will focus 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.660
 to the other jet with the live sight I 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.940
 start to blink and it's going to be like 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.130
 they try to fix with a missile of 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.110
 heat like a sting grown iglÃ¡ to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.690
 blink me once the square 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.660
 blake white coffee orange stop 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.970
 blink if you are going to hear a tone followed 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.790
 and you can already send one or both 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.190
 missiles towards the enemy that's how it 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.130
 used in the in what would be xbox and 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.739
 Playstation 3 can change it with me 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.470
 with triangle and in that way select 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.170
 the weapon either missiles or machine guns 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.000
 to your liking and choice very well already 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.890
 we have the basics in fact it's pretty 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.080
 simple these missiles have nothing 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.060
 to see that there is not much technique nor 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.950
 a lot to learn just you 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.340
 they set a goal to launch the missiles 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.129
 as if as 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.930
 in any other weapon and it's that way 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.280
 simple some tips that I would give you here 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.530
 is what matters most how 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.360
 use them correctly these tips 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.069
 good has a heat seeker 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.500
 generally the stinger and in the acronym 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.209
 you can see that they have a missile 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.489
 to shoot do not have two missiles is 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.519
 say shoot a reload and bulnes 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.230
 for the other here what they have is 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.840
 two missiles at your disposal that is 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.930
 you can send the two together one then the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.480
 another and so more or less use them to your 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.310
 mercy here is the first trick to send it 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.470
 one after the other for example in the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.599
 in jets it is more common when more or 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.610
 less are going at the same speed and you 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.040
 they follow them there behind them 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.599
 they do not move away so much but neither do they 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.360
 They come too close to get lost 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.910
 you fix the target if it is more or 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.269
 less far they notice they do not have it stuck to 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.560
 your noses can send first missile 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.989
 that missile usually all the pilots 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.910
 they use flares that missile is 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.370
 crash against the flares and have 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.810
 about three seconds or so in 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.150
 what they last in the protection of 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.500
 flares by wait about three seconds 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.210
 four seconds or less that 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.800
 dissipate flares a little 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.419
 there is more or less is with the practice they go to 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.069
 learn how much time is that 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.440
 they need to wait can send the 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.300
 second missile and that second missile it 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.590
 will hit the enemy because they will not reload 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.590
 its flares ie the flares 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.000
 they have 10 seconds of recharge if you 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.009
 the missile fired on ones that will be 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.990
 14 seconds after the first 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.060
 flares or have 6 seconds for the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.370
 missile arrives that is if the enemy does not 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.849
 is so far away or the or is faster than 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.620
 the missile 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.710
 the missile will collide in those 6 seconds and 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.570
 will be lost here so there's also 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.300
 another technique that is to send the two 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.070
 together this good sounds more or less 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.240
 you say good I have missiles sent the two 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.160
 together they are both going to crash 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.680
 previously with the amount of people 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.449
 that already have a flares a sm or 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.840
 even some extinguishers are going to see that 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.580
 it is impossible that or very unlikely that 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.870
 those two missiles crash when they go to 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.610
 kill you two missiles when 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.740
 are close enough to the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.659
 enemy so much so that his time of 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.669
 reaction is so little that I take the 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.740
 flares and even if you take out the flares and 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.630
 explode so close the missiles and those 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.800
 flares hit the missiles against the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.169
 flares 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.180
 and this explosion still reaches the enemy 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.860
 That's when you are going to send the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.720
 two missiles is to say if they are approaching 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.310
 full speed to a helicopter that does not 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.229
 has sm jammer or inhibitor sm rather 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.090
 you will arrive at full speed and 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.069
 they are going to start marking and almost almost 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.530
 when they are hitting the helicopter 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.389
 they're going to drop the two missiles and that's going to 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.020
 make good come out 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.000
 extremely close to the helicopter the 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.710
 pilot no longer has so much reaction takes 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.289
 in taking out the flares the visible ones are 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.389
 much closer and then the missiles were 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.990
 crash against the flares 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.770
 Extremely close to the vehicle 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.060
 causing him a lot of damage maybe sometimes 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.830
 incapacitating the vehicle is a technique 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.020
 that they can use in that sense 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.849
 also another technique that will help them 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.280
 a lot and I think it's the best for 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.870
 use them the missiles and that is that they go 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.000
 to use already when they are better with 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.530
 with the main machine gun by 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.180
 example what they can do is that 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.870
 when it is certain that those two missiles 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.690
 they are going to collide 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.419
 that is, they know that the enemy has 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.909
 extinguishers or s &amp; m and I waste it uselessly 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.670
 or flat to throw someone the 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.290
 he threw a stinger and released the flares 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.370
 in 10 seconds to send your flares 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:48.410
 gave their missiles what they can do is 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.200
 fix the target arrive send the 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.200
 two missiles that know they're going to crash and 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.150
 there they put him some that will be about 10 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.040
 10 bullets five bullets more or less to 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.370
 distance the point is that they lower it more or 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.160
 minus 20 percent thirty percent 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.860
 one hundred and twenty percent is well off 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.240
 damage is to say if they shoot it a little 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.100
 the time it takes for the 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.480
 missiles the other one is going to say ok they're coming 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.460
 the missiles that I do that although although or 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.230
 but while you are going to shoot him what 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.930
 they're going to lower their defenses they're going to get 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.090
 the missiles and they will have him dead there 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.710
 almost almost what it might look like from a
