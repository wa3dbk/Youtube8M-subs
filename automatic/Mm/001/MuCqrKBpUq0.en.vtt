don't stress there's no way that you
will<00:02:17.050> get<00:02:17.230> these<00:02:17.470> lines<00:02:17.740> perfect<00:02:18.310> close

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
will get these lines perfect close

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.720 
will get these lines perfect close
enough<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.480> okay<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.140> will<00:02:21.069> show<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.430> cool

shading<00:02:25.959> part<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.410> video<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:27.280> am<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
shading part of the video I am going to

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.500 
shading part of the video I am going to
be<00:02:28.330> using<00:02:28.510> both<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.830> paintbrush<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.030> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
be using both a paintbrush and a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.360 
be using both a paintbrush and a
blending<00:02:31.900> stump<00:02:31.930> I'm<00:02:32.290> gonna<00:02:32.530> be<00:02:32.650> using<00:02:32.770> both<00:02:33.100> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
blending stump I'm gonna be using both a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.680 
blending stump I'm gonna be using both a
lot<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:35.010> starting<00:02:36.010> out<00:02:36.130> with<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.489> number<00:02:37.450> 2

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
lot and starting out with the number 2

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.440 
lot and starting out with the number 2
pencil<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.739> HB<00:02:39.100> pencil<00:02:39.280> I'm<00:02:40.000> making<00:02:40.360> the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
pencil the HB pencil I'm making the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.449 
pencil the HB pencil I'm making the
frames<00:02:40.720> kind<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.170> dark<00:02:41.410> I'm<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.800> covering<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
frames kind of dark I'm not covering the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.470 
frames kind of dark I'm not covering the
entire<00:02:42.820> thing<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.650> look<00:02:44.650> closely<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.340> can

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
entire thing so look closely if you can

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.850 
entire thing so look closely if you can
I'm<00:02:47.110> leaving<00:02:47.470> some<00:02:47.890> areas<00:02:48.340> actually<00:02:48.850> light

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
I'm leaving some areas actually light

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.110 
I'm leaving some areas actually light
because<00:02:50.860> most<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.190> these<00:02:51.340> frames<00:02:51.760> are

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
because most of these frames are

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.900 
because most of these frames are
translucent<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.250> some<00:02:54.459> light<00:02:54.670> gets

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
translucent you know some light gets

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.420 
translucent you know some light gets
through<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:55.660> I'm<00:02:56.500> putting<00:02:56.830> some<00:02:57.040> areas

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
through it so I'm putting some areas

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.850 
through it so I'm putting some areas
dark<00:02:57.730> some<00:02:58.209> areas<00:02:58.569> light<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.350> doesn't<00:02:59.560> matter

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
dark some areas light it doesn't matter

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.740 
dark some areas light it doesn't matter
so<00:03:00.160> much<00:03:00.370> which<00:03:00.580> areas<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.150> put<00:03:01.330> dark<00:03:01.600> in

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
so much which areas you put dark in

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.420 
so much which areas you put dark in
which<00:03:01.930> areas<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.410> put<00:03:02.739> light<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.280> can

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
which areas you put light so you can

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.670 
which areas you put light so you can
switch<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:03.970> up<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.180> little<00:03:04.300> bit<00:03:04.569> my<00:03:05.260> main<00:03:05.440> point

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
switch it up a little bit my main point

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.740 
switch it up a little bit my main point
make<00:03:06.010> sure<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.489> put<00:03:06.700> some<00:03:07.120> areas<00:03:07.480> dark

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
make sure that you put some areas dark

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.229 
make sure that you put some areas dark
some<00:03:08.350> areas<00:03:08.709> light<00:03:08.980> look<00:03:09.850> up<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> upper

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
some areas light look up in the upper

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.670 
some areas light look up in the upper
corner<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:12.610> left<00:03:12.819> eye<00:03:13.120> yeah<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.350> one<00:03:14.530> on

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
corner of the left eye yeah the one on

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.490 
corner of the left eye yeah the one on
our<00:03:14.890> right<00:03:15.160> his<00:03:15.579> left<00:03:15.940> eye<00:03:16.180> I'm<00:03:17.110> putting<00:03:17.410> a

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
our right his left eye I'm putting a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.870 
our right his left eye I'm putting a
little<00:03:17.590> bit<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:18.010> reflection<00:03:18.549> from<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
little bit of a reflection from the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.430 
little bit of a reflection from the
glasses<00:03:19.120> you're<00:03:19.450> gonna<00:03:19.570> see<00:03:19.780> even<00:03:20.049> more<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.350> a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
glasses you're gonna see even more of a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.740 
glasses you're gonna see even more of a
reflection<00:03:20.730> being<00:03:21.730> done<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.390> other<00:03:22.630> eye

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
reflection being done on the other eye

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.190 
reflection being done on the other eye
and<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:24.010> shaded<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.489> area<00:03:24.940> first<00:03:25.299> but<00:03:25.959> then<00:03:26.110> I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
and I shaded that area first but then I

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.860 
and I shaded that area first but then I
go<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.500> with<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.769> pencil<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.850> don't<00:03:28.810> know

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
go in with the pencil and I don't know

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.920 
go in with the pencil and I don't know
why<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:29.980> leaves<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.400> more<00:03:30.930> a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
why it is it just leaves a more a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.860 
why it is it just leaves a more a
realistic<00:03:32.739> more<00:03:32.950> sophisticated<00:03:33.610> mark<00:03:34.000> if<00:03:34.810> you

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
realistic more sophisticated mark if you

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.259 
realistic more sophisticated mark if you
go<00:03:35.170> over<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.470> first<00:03:35.799> with<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.670> hatching<00:03:37.090> and

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
go over it first with the hatching and

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.870 
go over it first with the hatching and
then<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.720> erase<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.400> maybe<00:03:39.400> because<00:03:39.640> it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
then you erase it maybe because it

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.539 
then you erase it maybe because it
blends<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.359> little<00:03:40.570> bit<00:03:40.720> better<00:03:41.459> notice<00:03:42.459> I

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
blends in a little bit better notice I

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.870 
blends in a little bit better notice I
went<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:43.060> little<00:03:43.209> bit<00:03:43.510> darker<00:03:44.350> on<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.880> the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
went a little bit darker on the the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.300 
went a little bit darker on the the
white<00:03:46.090> part<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.630> eye<00:03:46.840> I'm<00:03:47.739> making<00:03:48.100> sure

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
white part of the eye I'm making sure

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.670 
white part of the eye I'm making sure
that<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.609> lightest<00:03:49.090> thing<00:03:49.299> is<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:50.230> highlight

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
that the lightest thing is the highlight

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.220 
that the lightest thing is the highlight
and<00:03:51.090> I'm<00:03:52.090> doing<00:03:52.239> that<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.510> purpose<00:03:52.810> because

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
and I'm doing that on purpose because

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.890 
and I'm doing that on purpose because
usually<00:03:54.160> there's<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.670> glare<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.450> comes<00:03:55.690> from

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
usually there's a glare that comes from

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.940 
usually there's a glare that comes from
the<00:03:56.019> glasses

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the glasses

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.940 
the glasses
I<00:03:58.060> used<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.239> blending<00:03:59.660> stump<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.530> pretty<00:04:00.770> much

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
I used the blending stump to pretty much

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.309 
I used the blending stump to pretty much
cover<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.580> area<00:04:01.849> blending<00:04:02.690> stump<00:04:03.170> it's

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
cover in the area blending stump it's

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.320 
cover in the area blending stump it's
just<00:04:03.530> rolled<00:04:03.800> up<00:04:03.920> paper<00:04:04.099> that's<00:04:04.610> all<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.940> is

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
it really affects the evenness of the

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.710 
it really affects the evenness of the
tones<00:07:27.590> that<00:07:27.830> you're<00:07:27.950> putting<00:07:28.220> on<00:07:28.630> you<00:07:29.630> know

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
because the oil gets in it also damages

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:38.110 
because the oil gets in it also damages
the<00:07:31.970> paper<00:07:32.150> over<00:07:32.360> time<00:07:34.690> and<00:07:36.010> that's<00:07:37.010> that<00:07:37.310> if
