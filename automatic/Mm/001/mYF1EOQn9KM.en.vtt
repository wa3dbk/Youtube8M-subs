at<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> English<00:00:31.830> bug<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.730> are<00:00:32.820> talking<00:00:33.239> about

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
at the English bug we are talking about

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.319 
at the English bug we are talking about
the<00:00:33.690> differences<00:00:34.410> between<00:00:34.649> things<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the differences between things and to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.060 
the differences between things and to
talk<00:00:36.540> about<00:00:36.570> differences<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.860> need<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
talk about differences we need to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.979 
talk about differences we need to
understand<00:00:38.899> comparatives<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.050> superlatives

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
understand comparatives and superlatives

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.020 
understand comparatives and superlatives
let's<00:00:42.989> start<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.500> comparatives<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.879> use

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
let's start with comparatives we use

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.190 
let's start with comparatives we use
comparatives<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.379> compare<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:47.550> things

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
comparatives when we compare two things

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.770 
comparatives when we compare two things
for<00:00:49.200> example<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.879> knife<00:00:51.710> is<00:00:52.940> sharper<00:00:53.940> than

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
for example this knife is sharper than

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
for example this knife is sharper than
this<00:00:55.110> knife<00:00:56.989> both<00:00:57.989> knives<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.590> sharp<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.489> one

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this knife both knives are sharp but one

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.200 
this knife both knives are sharp but one
is<00:01:00.030> sharper<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.710> word<00:01:01.890> sharp<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.789> short

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
is sharper the word sharp is a short

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.630 
is sharper the word sharp is a short
adjective<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.799> compare<00:01:05.189> short

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
adjective and when we compare short

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.950 
adjective and when we compare short
adjectives<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.960> simply<00:01:07.380> follow<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.920> formula

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
adjectives we simply follow this formula

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.840 
adjectives we simply follow this formula
adjectives<00:01:10.040> with<00:01:11.040> er<00:01:11.430> plus<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> Van<00:01:13.700> look<00:01:14.700> at

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
adjectives with er plus and Van look at

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.789 
adjectives with er plus and Van look at
this<00:01:15.000> example<00:01:16.520> I'm<00:01:17.520> tall<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:19.290> man<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
change the spelling a little bit when we

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.830 
change the spelling a little bit when we
make<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> comparative<00:01:40.700> my<00:01:41.700> hat<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.150> fancy

here's another example juggling three

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.830 
here's another example juggling three
balls<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.430> difficult<00:02:22.820> but<00:02:23.820> juggling<00:02:24.450> three

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
balls is difficult but juggling three

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.540 
balls is difficult but juggling three
books<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.560> more<00:02:26.550> difficult<00:02:26.820> than<00:02:28.550> juggling

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
books is more difficult than juggling

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.410 
books is more difficult than juggling
three<00:02:29.910> balls<00:02:31.190> excellent<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.850> let's<00:02:33.150> take<00:02:33.390> a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
three balls excellent now let's take a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.460 
three balls excellent now let's take a
look<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:34.220> superlatives<00:02:36.290> superlatives<00:02:37.290> are

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
look at superlatives superlatives are

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.699 
look at superlatives superlatives are
formed<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.250> same<00:02:38.550> way<00:02:38.910> as<00:02:39.180> comparatives<00:02:40.110> but

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
formed the same way as comparatives but

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.920 
formed the same way as comparatives but
we<00:02:40.860> use<00:02:41.750> est<00:02:42.750> instead<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.770> ER<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.930> most

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
we use est instead of ER and most

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.699 
we use est instead of ER and most
instead<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.860> more<00:02:48.170> take<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> look<00:02:49.470> at<00:02:49.590> these

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
instead of more take a look at these

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.970 
instead of more take a look at these
