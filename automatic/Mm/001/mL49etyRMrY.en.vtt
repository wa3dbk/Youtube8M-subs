00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.450 
a neat little package to keep them in so
and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.850> thought<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.840> gonna

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.630 

we<00:01:46.460> secure<00:01:46.850> this<00:01:46.970> but<00:01:47.150> it's<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.420> little<00:01:48.640> scout

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
we secure this but it's a little scout

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.249 
we secure this but it's a little scout
envelope<00:01:50.210> from<00:01:50.360> stamp<00:01:50.689> that<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.840> thought<00:01:51.140> she

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
envelope from stamp that I thought she

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.660 
envelope from stamp that I thought she
could<00:01:51.380> put<00:01:51.530> stamps<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:52.070> there<00:01:52.250> she<00:01:52.460> want

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
could put stamps in there she want

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.820 
could put stamps in there she want
either<00:01:52.850> whatever<00:01:53.810> maybe<00:01:54.350> I'll<00:01:54.500> take<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.710> little

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
either whatever maybe I'll take a little

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.440 
either whatever maybe I'll take a little
note<00:01:55.130> in<00:01:55.310> there<00:01:55.340> but<00:01:55.729> I<00:01:55.940> just<00:01:56.119> thought<00:01:56.390> that

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
note in there but I just thought that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.960 
note in there but I just thought that
was<00:01:56.690> just<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.409> really<00:01:57.710> cute<00:01:58.009> idea<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.640> I'm<00:01:58.729> just

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
was just a really cute idea and I'm just

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.999 
was just a really cute idea and I'm just
wrapping<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.630> ribbon<00:02:00.380> through<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:00.979> you

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
wrapping the ribbon through it so you

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.670 
wrapping the ribbon through it so you
can<00:02:01.189> tie<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.020> one<00:02:03.020> thing<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.290> noticed<00:02:03.320> with

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
can tie it and one thing I noticed with

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.510 
can tie it and one thing I noticed with
the<00:02:03.830> Stampin<00:02:04.190> Up<00:02:04.280> cardstock<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:04.940> what<00:02:05.149> I<00:02:05.450> did

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the Stampin Up cardstock is what I did

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.229 
the Stampin Up cardstock is what I did
when<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:08.140> folded<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.350> feels<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.700> could<00:02:10.729> rip

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
when I folded it feels like it could rip

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.160 
when I folded it feels like it could rip
and<00:02:12.130> I'm<00:02:13.130> not<00:02:13.340> really<00:02:13.520> sure<00:02:13.670> how<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.959> had

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and I'm not really sure how to if I had

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.630 
and I'm not really sure how to if I had
seen<00:02:15.410> binding<00:02:15.860> or<00:02:15.980> something<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.430> would<00:02:16.610> have

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
seen binding or something I would have

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.180 
seen binding or something I would have
added<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.050> didn't<00:02:18.980> know<00:02:19.010> what

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
added it to it but I didn't know what

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.120 
added it to it but I didn't know what
else<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.430> put<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.300> keep<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.660> from

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
else to put on it to keep it from

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.949 
else to put on it to keep it from
tearing<00:02:22.130> further<00:02:22.459> I'm<00:02:22.580> hoping<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.060> holds<00:02:23.660> up<00:02:23.810> a

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
tearing further I'm hoping it holds up a

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.720 
tearing further I'm hoping it holds up a
little<00:02:24.170> bit<00:02:24.319> at<00:02:24.470> least<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.040> cards<00:02:25.400> will<00:02:25.580> be

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
little bit at least the cards will be

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.170 
little bit at least the cards will be
good<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:27.130> hopefully<00:02:28.130> she<00:02:28.310> likes<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.030> then

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
good and hopefully she likes it and then

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.960 
good and hopefully she likes it and then
