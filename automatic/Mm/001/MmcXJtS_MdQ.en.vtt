display I want to be completely focused

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.910 
display I want to be completely focused
on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> racing<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.170> attacking<00:00:55.170> every<00:00:55.530> corner

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
on the racing on attacking every corner

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
on the racing on attacking every corner
and<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.730> need<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> information<00:00:57.890> completely<00:00:58.890> in

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and I need the information completely in

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
and I need the information completely in
front<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.609> me<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:01.019> what's<00:01:01.260> going

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
front of me so I can know what's going

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.259 
front of me so I can know what's going
on<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> car<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.609> at<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> same<00:01:02.969> time<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
on with the car but at the same time I

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.500 
on with the car but at the same time I
can<00:01:03.539> push<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.050> limit<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> most

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
can push it to the limit the most

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.050 
can push it to the limit the most
important<00:01:07.080> information<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.950> lap<00:01:08.160> time<00:01:08.370> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
important information is the lap time so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.899 
important information is the lap time so
I<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.290> fast<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:10.829> I<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.670> see

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
I can see if I'm fast or not I can see

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
I can see if I'm fast or not I can see
also<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> tire<00:01:13.409> pressure<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> very

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
also the tire pressure which is very

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
also the tire pressure which is very
important<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.170> also<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.470> matter<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
important because it's also a matter of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.060 
important because it's also a matter of
safety<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.670> also<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.970> matter<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.329> performance

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
safety and also a matter of performance

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
safety and also a matter of performance
another<00:01:20.070> important<00:01:20.759> information<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.750> are

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
another important information I have are

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.649 
another important information I have are
the<00:01:22.680> gear<00:01:22.920> lights<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.149> shift<00:01:24.450> at

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the gear lights so I can shift at

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.280 
the gear lights so I can shift at
exactly<00:01:25.520> here<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.700> every<00:01:27.240> time<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.869> only<00:01:27.930> on

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
exactly here at every time not only on

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
exactly here at every time not only on
acceleration<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.460> also<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.180> which

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
acceleration but also I know in which

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.510 
acceleration but also I know in which
gear<00:01:30.689> I'm<00:01:30.810> doing<00:01:31.079> each<00:01:31.320> corner<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.040> that's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
gear I'm doing each corner and that's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.440 
gear I'm doing each corner and that's
very<00:01:32.970> important<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> race<00:01:33.750> driver<00:01:35.240> as<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
very important for a race driver as you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.929 
very important for a race driver as you
can<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.899> this<00:01:37.740> space<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.430> small<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
can see this space is really small and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.080 
can see this space is really small and
it<00:01:39.210> gets<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.750> hot<00:01:39.930> during<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.100> race<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.790> can

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it gets really hot during a race I can

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
it gets really hot during a race I can
lose<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.930> liter<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.320> fluid<00:01:43.680> per<00:01:43.890> hour

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
lose up to one liter of fluid per hour

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.940 
lose up to one liter of fluid per hour
and<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.390> our<00:01:45.540> condition<00:01:46.020> another

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and I don't have our condition another

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.399 
and I don't have our condition another
thing<00:01:47.219> I<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> Navi<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.659> course

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
thing I don't have is the Navi of course

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.380 
thing I don't have is the Navi of course
if<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.860> lost<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> racetrack<00:01:50.880> will<00:01:51.630> be

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
if I get lost in the racetrack will be

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.410 
if I get lost in the racetrack will be
something<00:01:53.200> not<00:01:53.380> usual<00:01:53.830> we<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.000> couple<00:01:55.300> of

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
something not usual we have a couple of

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.240 
something not usual we have a couple of
interesting<00:01:55.720> settings<00:01:56.440> here<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.920> steering

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
interesting settings here the steering

traction control of the car plus or

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.260 
traction control of the car plus or
minus<00:02:02.860> means<00:02:03.220> more<00:02:03.550> or<00:02:03.700> less<00:02:03.820> traction

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
control you can control the brake

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.460 
control you can control the brake
distribution<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.300> more<00:02:07.570> front<00:02:07.900> or<00:02:08.110> more<00:02:08.289> rear

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
distribution so more front or more rear

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.460 
distribution so more front or more rear
depending<00:02:09.070> how<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.460> car<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:09.790> handling<00:02:10.470> you
