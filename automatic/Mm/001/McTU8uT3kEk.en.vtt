 with positions good luck to you all hello my 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.580
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.430
 position issue 97 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.340
 So we start with a great position on 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.580
 map south coast squared there are seven 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.840
 you need a fast medium tank with 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.299
 strong tower 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 coming here at the beginning of the battle here you can 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.280
 shoot at enemies who are trying 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.530
 break through the center so pretty 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.560
 often besides you can 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.009
 highlight the enemies who got up there in 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.900
 bushes here on top of this mountain and also 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.329
 It is worth noting that you can here 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.670
 excellent tank tower at the expense of 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.180
 uneven terrain and can easily 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.280
 hide all your tank is also worth 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 note that there is likely to lack 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.420
 orton and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.700
 it is of course very well well and besides 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.860
 you agrit and enemies here 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
 for sure they want to destroy you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.350
 and thereby substitute your 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
 allies and in general you will make out all 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.400
 opponents who will be here next 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.430
 be 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.830
 overall, the position is very good for everyone 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.050
 I advise 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.020
 next we have very interesting and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.200
 original position on nhl map in 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.100
 square to 1 you will need very much 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.050
 fast tank for example a tree and are going 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.020
 here in such a way in principle 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.020
 it won't take you long 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.240
 this is of course an obvious plus as you can 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.550
 see from the very beginning this position 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.180
 looks pretty good 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.670
 and I advise here to go of course if your 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.910
 the team is merging and you need to somehow 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.000
 defit your base as you can see 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.240
 from here comes a chic chamber all 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 the ride to your base is excellent 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.670
 shoot through and enemies just like that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.010
 undetected will not be able to drive up if 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.800
 you have a good review then you can perfectly 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.530
 shine from here if you have a good one 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.580
 masking the enemy will be difficult 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.769
 discover you besides if all of you 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.160
 they will even see here quickly 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.760
 hide and ride there a little bit that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.850
 boards 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.250
 did not get a place here quite a lot can 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.370
 say that these are perfect positions for 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.500
 defense of your base as you can see 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.590
 the player calmly understands with all 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.830
 enemies who are leaving here and at the same time 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.370
 he himself does not lose strength and that says 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.430
 already about very much besides the player is not 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.430
 simply destroyed all he had them here 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.860
 took the last opponent and won 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.730
 fight and this is the answer to those who say that 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.340
 positions in the game we do not drag next 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.730
 position is on the airfield map at 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.640
 square co2 you will need inconspicuous 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.709
 Fri-Sau with a good overview you are driving at the beginning 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.720
 fight here and hope that 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.600
 opponents will rashit on water 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.030
 well, that is, bye from the line and then you 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.280
 you can shoot them perfectly well and 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.680
 you yourself are most likely not to glow 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.410
 it will be but even if the enemies see you 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.350
 here you can quickly hide behind a stone 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.960
 which is next 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.240
 also worth noting that you yourself 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.370
 sometimes you can shine enemies but still 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.130
 it is desirable that your doing it 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.350
 allies who are likely to be 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.650
 be near this mountain and already they 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.160
 will highlight your overall position 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.330
 very interesting and safe and 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.640
 effective given simple but her 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.150
 can be applied on even the most 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.390
 slow fri-sau generally not accurate instead 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.060
 liked more we are 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.670
 curious. on the map northwest in 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.330
 a7 square it is worth going here 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.570
 movable signed with good disguise 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.910
 climb up here on this ridge and 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.610
 get on it to the top and there 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.270
 already take a position and sniper and 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.980
 enemies, these positions are well suited 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.800
 to defend your base 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.440
 if opponents start actively 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.870
 attack they break through differently 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.170
 flank you can perfectly for them 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.600
 shoot besides it is worth noting that 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.290
 because of the large number of trees here 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.410
 you are hidden then opponents and light you 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.010
 it will be quite difficult the whole place 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.010
 good and then you can shoot well 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.290
 almost always there is at least one 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.930
 the enemy which is substituted and you 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:41.920
 you can deal enough damage to him 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.050
 to fight was a successful disadvantage 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.900
 This position is what if 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.080
 opponents will not go on the attack or will not 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.540
 there is substituted then from here you are unlikely 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.240
 you can normally shoot well and so in 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.240
 the whole place is very interesting 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.419
 of all 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.789
 and the last position today is 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.669
 on the map is the sacred valley in square c 6 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.940
 you will need a tank with good wayne and 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.889
 strong tower go here at the beginning of the battle and 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.129
 here you can shoot at enemies 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:23.169
 who drive past to the same enemies 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.120
 hardly able to react to you 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.310
 because in most cases they are not 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.409
 expect that you appear here 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.099
 and thus you can use it 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.699
 and shoot damage to opponents right in 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.159
 boards 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:38.560
 besides you can do very well here 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:41.490
 tank turret at the expense of uneven 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.430
 relief there is a big drawback 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:48.340
 Of course there shoots art and if 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:52.000
 There are many arts in battle, then she can give you a lot 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.789
 it hurts to send but if there is no art then 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.090
 it's just a great place to be 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:59.620
 to play aggressively and actively in battle 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.870
 I think it will be fun 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.180
 well and on it all friends thanks for
