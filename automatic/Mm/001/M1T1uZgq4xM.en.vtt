I'm<00:01:26.770> going<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.069> go<00:01:27.190> at<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:27.460> one<00:01:27.670> because<00:01:27.789> it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
I'm going to go at this one because it's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.529 
I'm going to go at this one because it's
a<00:01:28.240> little<00:01:28.690> bit<00:01:28.780> larger<00:01:29.759> take<00:01:30.759> my<00:01:31.000> special

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
a little bit larger take my special

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.969 
a little bit larger take my special
stamping<00:01:32.500> polish<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:38.049> want<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.380> apply<00:01:38.860> it

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
stamping polish and you want to apply it

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.770 
stamping polish and you want to apply it
like<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.880> find<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.390> when<00:01:43.450> you

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
like that and I find that when you

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.929 
like that and I find that when you
scrape<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.950> should<00:01:45.130> scrape<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.759> a

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
scrape it you should scrape it in a

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.889 
scrape it you should scrape it in a
curved<00:01:46.360> motion<00:01:46.750> basically<00:01:47.560> following<00:01:47.979> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
curved motion basically following the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.840 
curved motion basically following the
design<00:01:49.899> shape<00:01:50.409> because<00:01:51.070> if<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.430> scrape<00:01:51.670> it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
design shape because if you scrape it

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.910 
design shape because if you scrape it
directly<00:01:52.240> like<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.719> it<00:01:52.990> will<00:01:53.409> miss<00:01:53.680> some

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
directly like this it will miss some

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.429 
directly like this it will miss some
spots<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.579> that's<00:01:54.880> not<00:01:55.659> what<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.049> want<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.290> do

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
spots and that's not what you want to do

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.270 
spots and that's not what you want to do
so<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:58.079> scrape<00:01:59.079> it<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.560> curved<00:01:59.890> motion

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
so you just scrape it in a curved motion

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.529 
so you just scrape it in a curved motion
like<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:02.340> take<00:02:03.340> your<00:02:03.460> Stamper<00:02:04.060> make<00:02:04.390> sure

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
like that take your Stamper make sure

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.910 
like that take your Stamper make sure
it's<00:02:04.689> clean<00:02:06.570> stamp<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.049> this<00:02:08.619> one<00:02:08.799> is<00:02:08.890> a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
it's clean stamp it and this one is a

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.090 
it's clean stamp it and this one is a
little<00:02:09.250> bit<00:02:09.369> messed<00:02:09.579> up<00:02:09.820> as<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.209> can<00:02:10.329> see<00:02:10.600> I

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
little bit messed up as you can see I

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.979 
little bit messed up as you can see I
waited<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> little<00:02:12.280> too<00:02:12.459> long<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.780> take

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
waited a little too long so just take

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.310 
waited a little too long so just take
your<00:02:14.170> polish<00:02:14.560> remover

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:31.150 

wipe<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.560> off<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.500> start<00:02:22.860> again

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.580 

scrape<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.360> curved<00:02:32.720> motion<00:02:34.570> pick<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.720> up<00:02:35.840> so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
scrape in a curved motion pick it up so

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.410 
scrape in a curved motion pick it up so
there<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.310> then<00:02:37.880> what<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.090> want<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.240> do

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
there it is and then what you want to do

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.860 
there it is and then what you want to do
is<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:39.080> want<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.620> just<00:02:42.610> put<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.790> follow<00:02:44.630> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
is you want to just put it follow the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:58.820 
is you want to just put it follow the
curve<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.380> your<00:02:45.800> nail<00:02:50.950> sees<00:02:52.480> missed<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.750> part

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.070 

and<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.610> sometimes<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.180> comes<00:03:00.390> up<00:03:00.660> like<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
and then sometimes it comes up like that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.520 
and then sometimes it comes up like that
to<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.560> press<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.070> down<00:03:02.900> like<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.350> you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
to just press it down like that as you

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.260 
to just press it down like that as you
can<00:03:04.620> see<00:03:04.800> it's<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> little<00:03:05.370> bit<00:03:05.520> lopsided<00:03:05.730> but

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
can see it's a little bit lopsided but

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.760 
can see it's a little bit lopsided but
that's<00:03:06.480> okay<00:03:06.810> because<00:03:06.990> you're<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> go

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
that's okay because you're going to go

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.750 
that's okay because you're going to go
over<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.520> with<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.000> second<00:03:09.650> coat<00:03:10.650> meaning<00:03:11.610> what

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
over it with a second coat meaning what

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.070 
over it with a second coat meaning what
you're<00:03:11.940> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.270> over<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> second

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
you're going to go over it the second

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.380 
you're going to go over it the second
time<00:03:13.110> because<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.640> opaque<00:03:15.150> enough<00:03:20.390> stop

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
time because it's not opaque enough stop

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:37.440 
time because it's not opaque enough stop
it<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:25.490> oopsies<00:03:26.490> wrong<00:03:26.760> way

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.640 

keep<00:03:38.110> missing<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:38.739> part<00:03:38.980> don't<00:03:39.340> know<00:03:39.520> why

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.550 

and<00:03:45.250> then<00:03:45.400> is<00:03:45.670> press<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.329> down<00:03:47.700> like<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
and then is press it down like that

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.860 
and then is press it down like that
it's<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.160> little<00:03:51.340> stringy<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.090> just<00:03:52.300> like<00:03:52.480> peel

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
it's a little stringy so just like peel

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.960 
it's a little stringy so just like peel
that<00:03:53.110> part<00:03:53.410> off<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:57.130> still<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.520> little

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
that part off it's still a little

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.180 
that part off it's still a little
lopsided<00:03:58.420> but<00:03:59.080> I<00:03:59.140> can<00:03:59.349> fix<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.739> with<00:04:00.160> a

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
lopsided but I can fix that with a

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.880 
lopsided but I can fix that with a
striper<00:04:00.700> or<00:04:01.060> just<00:04:01.750> go<00:04:01.930> over<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.290> third<00:04:02.500> time<00:04:02.770> if

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
striper or just go over to third time if

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.740 
striper or just go over to third time if
you<00:04:03.010> want<00:04:03.040> but<00:04:03.489> this<00:04:03.940> doesn't<00:04:04.270> bother<00:04:04.390> me<00:04:04.599> a
