00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.880 

comb<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:59.110> twist<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.290> and<00:01:00.440> clip<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.710> out<00:01:00.770> of

comb that twist it and clip it out of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.350 
comb that twist it and clip it out of
the<00:01:00.950> way<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:03.550> this<00:01:04.550> is<00:01:04.699> where<00:01:04.879> I'll<00:01:05.000> start

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
the way and this is where I'll start

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.430 
the way and this is where I'll start
back<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.990> nape<00:01:06.290> area<00:01:08.080> now<00:01:09.080> there<00:01:09.260> are<00:01:09.320> all

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
back in the nape area now there are all

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.580 
back in the nape area now there are all
levels<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.190> lengths<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:11.330> bobs<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.409> can

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
levels and lengths of bobs that you can

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.609 
levels and lengths of bobs that you can
cut<00:01:12.910> I'm<00:01:13.910> gonna<00:01:14.150> cut<00:01:14.360> a<00:01:14.390> longer<00:01:14.840> bob<00:01:15.020> because

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
cut I'm gonna cut a longer bob because

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.170 
cut I'm gonna cut a longer bob because
my<00:01:15.890> model<00:01:16.100> doesn't<00:01:16.400> want<00:01:16.640> her<00:01:16.700> hair<00:01:16.880> super

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
my model doesn't want her hair super

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.570 
my model doesn't want her hair super
short<00:01:17.450> but<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.470> idea<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.160> give<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> nice

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
short but the idea is to give a nice

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.930 
short but the idea is to give a nice
blunt<00:01:20.330> clean<00:01:20.869> edge<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:23.300> hair<00:01:24.790> so<00:01:25.790> this

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
blunt clean edge to the hair so this

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.420 
blunt clean edge to the hair so this
point<00:01:26.300> I'm<00:01:26.540> gonna<00:01:26.869> have<00:01:27.229> my<00:01:27.560> model<00:01:27.890> drop<00:01:28.250> her

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
point I'm gonna have my model drop her

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.749 
point I'm gonna have my model drop her
chin<00:01:28.729> down<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:29.930> very<00:01:30.170> important

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
chin down and this is a very important

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.560 
chin down and this is a very important
step<00:01:32.350> because<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.100> hair<00:01:34.280> naturally<00:01:35.000> will

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
step because the hair naturally will

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.200 
step because the hair naturally will
kick<00:01:35.810> under<00:01:36.289> once<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.070> head<00:01:37.220> is<00:01:37.369> put<00:01:37.759> upright

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
kick under once the head is put upright

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.980 
kick under once the head is put upright
if<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:39.020> start<00:01:39.320> with<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.560> head<00:01:39.740> forward<00:01:40.990> so

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
if you start with the head forward so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.930 
if you start with the head forward so
this<00:01:42.140> point<00:01:42.410> I<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:42.530> comb<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.520> hair<00:01:43.610> straight

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
this point I just comb the hair straight

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.969 
this point I just comb the hair straight
down<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:45.640> trim<00:01:46.640> off<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:48.200> amount<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.619> want

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
down and trim off the amount that I want

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.880 
down and trim off the amount that I want
to<00:01:49.910> create<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.390> nice<00:01:50.660> blunt<00:01:51.380> bob<00:01:51.950> line<00:01:53.890> once

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
to create that nice blunt bob line once

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.560 
to create that nice blunt bob line once
again<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.520> bob<00:01:56.619> can<00:01:57.619> be<00:01:57.770> anywhere<00:01:58.250> from<00:01:58.570> just

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
again a bob can be anywhere from just

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.550 
again a bob can be anywhere from just
below<00:01:59.720> your<00:02:00.020> neck<00:02:00.200> up<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.009> your<00:02:01.130> chin<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:03.200> idea

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
below your neck up to your chin the idea

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.890 
below your neck up to your chin the idea
of<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.829> bob<00:02:04.040> is<00:02:04.369> really<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.880> blunt<00:02:05.090> line<00:02:05.360> and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
of a bob is really the blunt line and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.560 
of a bob is really the blunt line and
you<00:02:06.409> can<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.799> I'm<00:02:07.690> holding<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.780> hair<00:02:08.959> taut

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
you can see I'm holding the hair taut

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.390 
you can see I'm holding the hair taut
between<00:02:11.570> my<00:02:11.930> fingers<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.250> have

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
between my fingers so that I have

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.229 
between my fingers so that I have
control<00:02:17.000> over<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.360> line<00:02:17.570> now<00:02:18.049> sometimes

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
control over the line now sometimes

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.610 
control over the line now sometimes
little<00:02:20.239> hairs<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.660> get<00:02:20.810> missed<00:02:21.049> so<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.470> want

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
little hairs can get missed so you want

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.000 
little hairs can get missed so you want
to<00:02:21.680> make<00:02:21.829> sure<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:24.019> comb<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.560> hair<00:02:24.709> down

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
to make sure that you comb the hair down

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.699 
to make sure that you comb the hair down

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
once you've cut it you want to comb the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.160 
once you've cut it you want to comb the
