00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.360
 now it's out the fleuth has his 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.520
 lost mega water and therefore needs 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.260
 Now he has a new one 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.150
 I wrote to him and asked him 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.110
 of course I can build one, of course 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.000
 do not say no 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.260
 to get the project going 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.879
 I needed a bit because of it 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 Again other materials are than me 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 otherwise use 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.879
 but I think I mean now 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.379
 best possible solution found 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.850
 At first , the plan was a casting mold 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.980
 produce and the whole in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.589
 However, it would be to pour polyurethane 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.269
 disproportionately expensive and me 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.790
 I do not know it that way 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.570
 with it being one hundred percent 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.070
 would have worked 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.900
 the biggest problem would be 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.820
 that I do not care about the inner life 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.890
 could take good care of it then because i go through 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.810
 still would have to work through 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.510
 and it's just not at all 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.500
 by outside break of two parts in 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 fiberglass 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.740
 it came damn robust can be 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 grind beautifully and then beautiful 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.310
 actually paint only as benefits 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.650
 the project mega water will be like 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.900
 Follow build in the first episode build 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.510
 we split a bares into two parts 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.390
 scaffolding to fill this skeleton construction 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.470
 in the second episode we get up with foam 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 fill the blank with the outside 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.350
 a spatula follow 3 and 4 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.780
 then deal with subtleties 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.790
 paint incisions handle and so on 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.280
 continue depending on how it is headed 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.590
 the one more or less he follows more 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 like you know me but i can 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 do not plan it right now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.150
 I'm not sure yet that's up here 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.250
 every case is one thing why we 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.470
 throw us right in and happen 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 Let's start with the skeleton kits 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.250
 it's July 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
 What 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.100
 I now have the paper template 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.569
 glued on and three plates 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.140
 glued together with double-sided 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.790
 duct tape 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.740
 I need three pieces of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.060
 these cut out forms then the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.010
 The easiest way to do it is when I get it 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.959
 all at once you're snowing now 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.319
 first time my band saw action 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.940
 see 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.790
 that would be a video together 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.180
 assembled so we cut that 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.180
 now off 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.470
 get now at the base salary of the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.030
 second level in the 3d level 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.909
 We orient ourselves a bit 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.640
 at the shipbuilding and that fasten it 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.180
 first with the hot glue gun here 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.150
 a quasi like the ship down stop 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.799
 you here and then there are left 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.289
 and on the right still exciting 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.220
 with attached firstly around this corner in the 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.139
 keep wink 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.699
 and second, then, for larger strokes 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.289
 I do not have that over here 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.120
 everything around it must fillet if I 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.900
 then the record hereby 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.900
 cut in 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.350
 this consequence is already closed again 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.510
 But the end of it can definitely now 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.280
 only construction looks so misshapen 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.110
 had over such a few light ones 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.820
 markets and stuff but it really is 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.430
 got better than me actually 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.780
 have thought and why if I mean 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.490
 lathe a span 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.170
 and then it turned up too 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.930
 Seen instagram is already running 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.620
 extremely round and huggel hardly not 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.210
 amazing 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.890
 this reason is now in two 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.900
 parts decompose to that then we do it 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.860
 can better continue to edit the 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.260
 We will drive in the next 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.090
 follow suit with then watch 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.100
 cut with a cutter knife or something 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.360
 and then I fill up 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.920
 However, I must now as a video 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.520
 put cut because otherwise I can 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.710
 not me 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.090
 until friday a great video too 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.250
 Otherwise everyone else comes here 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.570
 just think so I say now 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.570
 keep your ears stiff and
