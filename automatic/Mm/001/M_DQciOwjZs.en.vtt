00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that's right so you know it's it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
that's right so you know it's it's
definitely<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.960> different<00:01:35.030> there's<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
definitely a different there's a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.280 
definitely a different there's a
different<00:01:36.390> context<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> also

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
different context for it and I also

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.530 
different context for it and I also
think<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> real<00:01:39.090> danger

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
think that you know the the real danger

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.690 
think that you know the the real danger
is<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.350> particularly<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.460> France

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
is I I do think particularly in France

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.480 
is I I do think particularly in France
because<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:43.950> saying<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.250> mean<00:01:44.340> this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
because as I was saying I mean this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
because as I was saying I mean this
woman<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:46.040> really<00:01:47.630> without<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:49.020> any

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
woman has really without in any
