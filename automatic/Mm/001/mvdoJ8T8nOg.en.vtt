here every time advances come out in
technology<00:01:03.139> people<00:01:03.649> end<00:01:03.920> up<00:01:03.979> coming<00:01:04.280> back<00:01:04.309> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
technology people end up coming back and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.630 
technology people end up coming back and
pulling<00:01:04.970> more<00:01:05.150> from<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.479> same<00:01:05.659> old<00:01:05.840> patches

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640

so<00:01:07.640> am<00:01:08.000> i<00:01:08.090> slow<00:01:08.359> down<00:01:08.539> take<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.289> listen<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.770> see

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
so am i slow down take a listen and see

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.569 
so am i slow down take a listen and see
what<00:01:10.130> comes<00:01:10.310> out<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:11.079> use<00:01:12.079> my<00:01:12.320> GPS<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:13.189> find<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
what comes out I use my GPS to find the

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.160 
what comes out I use my GPS to find the
location<00:01:14.119> where<00:01:14.270> I've<00:01:14.390> found<00:01:14.630> gold<00:01:14.899> in<00:01:15.049> the

location where I've found gold in the
past<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:15.979> then<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.030> search<00:01:17.270> begins

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
pepper patch out here I think all the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
gold is hiding because it's so hot and I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.440 
gold is hiding because it's so hot and I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.920

a<00:02:53.840> matter<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.170> putting<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.530> coil<00:02:54.890> over<00:02:55.310> it
