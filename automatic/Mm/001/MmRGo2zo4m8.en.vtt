00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.999
 I finished third 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.199

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.630
 vetiver hundred that the best I've lived so far 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 I do not think it's the only flag for that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.769
 and that is to undertake was very closed there was great level 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.839
 I have always dreamed of being a champion, indicated the empordá that is juvenile 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.949
 now I make my dream come true 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 and then I will never think about being in the position that I 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.220
 that I found today with 20 points down the final 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.050
 but they can do that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.100

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.560
 ivery from the last place 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.890

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.520
 read leisure 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.740
 I always had 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.130
 I concentrated too much on the country 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.560
