I<00:00:14.059> did<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> art<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.830> bricks<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.580> big

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
I did the art for the bricks and the big

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.900 
I did the art for the bricks and the big
brick<00:00:18.119> background<00:00:18.439> but<00:00:19.439> someone<00:00:20.310> saw<00:00:20.699> my

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
brick background but someone saw my

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.700 
brick background but someone saw my
video<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:21.510> messaged<00:00:21.840> me<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.140> basically

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
graphics for it so they're doing the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.640 
graphics for it so they're doing the
drawings<00:00:27.449> they're<00:00:27.990> taking<00:00:28.349> over<00:00:28.410> the

drawings they're taking over the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.919 
drawings they're taking over the

um yeah that if you touch the lava then

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.520 
um yeah that if you touch the lava then
you<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.789> start<00:00:51.059> back<00:00:51.570> from<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> start<00:00:52.260> or

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you have to start back from the start or

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
we're using a kind of like checkpoint so

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.950 
we're using a kind of like checkpoint so
if<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> walk<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.609> press<00:01:02.820> X<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
if you walk up to it and you press X you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.800 
if you walk up to it and you press X you
light<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> candle<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.240> your<00:01:06.240> checkpoint

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
light the candle and your checkpoint

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
light the candle and your checkpoint
will<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.049> stored<00:01:07.409> there<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.549> now<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.180> jump

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
will be stored there so now if I jump

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.719 
will be stored there so now if I jump
into<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.869> lava<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.439> start<00:01:11.340> from<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:13.140> um

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
into the lava I start from here so um

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
into the lava I start from here so um
this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.330> I've<00:01:15.659> edited<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this is kind of just I've edited the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.399 
this is kind of just I've edited the
last<00:01:16.740> prototype<00:01:17.520> level<00:01:17.909> before<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:19.259> bit

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
last prototype level before a little bit

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.100 
last prototype level before a little bit
and<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> light<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.450> than<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and see you can light more than one and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
and see you can light more than one and
then<00:01:22.229> when<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.100> changes<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> up

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
then when you like that it changes to up

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.570 
then when you like that it changes to up
there<00:01:23.939> yeah<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.830> been<00:01:26.009> editing<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
there yeah so I'm just been editing the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.840 
there yeah so I'm just been editing the
prototype<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.360> trying<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.850> oops

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
prototype of it trying to make a oops

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.140 
prototype of it trying to make a oops
trying<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.040> kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> testable<00:01:32.880> games

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
trying to make a kind of testable games

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
trying to make a kind of testable games
and<00:01:33.509> I've<00:01:33.780> gotten<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> few<00:01:34.110> people<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> try<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and I've gotten a few people to try it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.149 
and I've gotten a few people to try it
now<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.420> feedback<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.630> far<00:01:36.659> has<00:01:36.930> been<00:01:37.159> pretty

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
now and feedback so far has been pretty

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.880 
now and feedback so far has been pretty
decent<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:38.939> people<00:01:39.180> find<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.479> absolutely

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
decent some people find it absolutely

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.850 
decent some people find it absolutely
infuriating<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:42.140> good<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.380> feedback

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
infuriating but good good feedback

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.020 
infuriating but good good feedback
overall<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:46.880> yeah<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.780> didn't<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:50.549> bunch<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
overall so yeah I didn't a a bunch of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
overall so yeah I didn't a a bunch of
coding<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.630> actually<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.799> wasn't<00:01:53.009> too

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
coding and actually it wasn't too

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.429 
coding and actually it wasn't too
difficult<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.939> implement<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.540> checkpoints

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
difficult to implement the checkpoints

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.219 
difficult to implement the checkpoints
in<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> lava<00:01:56.000> because<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.540> Mike<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.140> way

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
in the lava because I have Mike the way

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.370 
in the lava because I have Mike the way
I<00:01:58.259> had<00:01:58.469> i<00:01:58.649> coded<00:01:58.979> before<00:01:59.600> it's<00:02:00.600> pretty<00:02:00.869> easy<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I had i coded before it's pretty easy to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.100 
I had i coded before it's pretty easy to
add<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> stuff<00:02:02.310> oh<00:02:02.640> crap<00:02:03.420> awesome<00:02:03.869> last

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
add on the stuff oh crap awesome last

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.520 
add on the stuff oh crap awesome last
one<00:02:05.600> okay

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
one okay

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.029 
one okay
yeah<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.130> because<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.090> way<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:09.509> coded

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
yeah so because this way it was coded

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.370 
yeah so because this way it was coded
because<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:12.600> stuff<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.990> set<00:02:13.230> up<00:02:13.350> for

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
because I was the stuff I set up for

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.410 
because I was the stuff I set up for
animations<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.340> could<00:02:14.550> actually<00:02:14.880> really

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
animations I could actually really

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.410 
animations I could actually really
easily<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.370> use<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> lot<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.970> same<00:02:18.150> code

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
easily I use a lot of the same code

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.360 
easily I use a lot of the same code
again<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.590> quick<00:02:19.890> actually

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
again so it's really quick actually

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.979 
again so it's really quick actually
which<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:20.880> great<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.580> now<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.209> can<00:02:24.540> add<00:02:24.720> lots

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
which is great and so now I can add lots

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.809 
which is great and so now I can add lots
of<00:02:25.200> different<00:02:25.500> types<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.830> tiles<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.550> game

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
of different types of tiles it's a game

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.430 
of different types of tiles it's a game
really<00:02:27.060> easily<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:28.560> great<00:02:29.000> um<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> want

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
really easily just great um what I want

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.510 
really easily just great um what I want
to<00:02:31.530> work<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.860> next<00:02:32.100> probably<00:02:32.700> sound<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.569> menu

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
to work on next probably sound or a menu

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.790 
to work on next probably sound or a menu
haven't<00:02:35.520> signed<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.910> yet<00:02:36.620> sound<00:02:37.620> would

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
haven't signed it yet sound would

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.340 
haven't signed it yet sound would
probably<00:02:38.100> be<00:02:38.250> my<00:02:38.370> next<00:02:38.580> step<00:02:38.850> because<00:02:39.350> it's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
probably be my next step because it's

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.979 
probably be my next step because it's
just<00:02:40.650> too<00:02:41.010> quiet<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.700> need<00:02:41.880> some<00:02:42.239> music<00:02:42.510> playing

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
and some maybe footsteps and stuff like

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.160 
and some maybe footsteps and stuff like
that<00:02:45.450> jumping<00:02:46.170> down<00:02:46.760> doing<00:02:47.760> terrible<00:02:51.170> okay

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
as a jar that you can double-click yeah

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.580 
as a jar that you can double-click yeah
so<00:03:05.040> um<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.970> took<00:03:06.209> me<00:03:06.360> ages<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:07.170> i<00:03:07.230> got<00:03:07.470> i

all right so if you can see up above the

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.050 
all right so if you can see up above the
old<00:03:52.350> checkpoint<00:03:52.890> i<00:03:52.980> use<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.760> i<00:03:53.850> lit

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
old checkpoint i use have because i lit

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.099 
old checkpoint i use have because i lit
this<00:03:54.180> new<00:03:54.420> candle<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.680> candles<00:03:55.920> gone<00:03:56.400> off

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
this new candle that candles gone off

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.259 
this new candle that candles gone off
which<00:03:58.109> i<00:03:58.320> think<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.620> pretty<00:03:58.859> cool<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.820> it<00:04:00.000> shows

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
which i think is pretty cool so it shows

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.870 
which i think is pretty cool so it shows
your<00:04:00.540> current<00:04:00.570> checkpoint<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.609> go

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
your current checkpoint and you can go

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.699 
your current checkpoint and you can go
back<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.120> light<00:04:03.510> those<00:04:03.840> ones<00:04:04.049> up<00:04:04.320> if<00:04:04.470> you

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
back and light those ones up if you

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.800 
back and light those ones up if you
decide<00:04:05.070> that<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.579> want<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.030> go<00:04:06.150> backwards<00:04:06.390> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
decide that you want to go backwards and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:15.080
