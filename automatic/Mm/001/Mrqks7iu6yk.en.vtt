00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
up it's a great source of calcium for

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.630 
up it's a great source of calcium for
them<00:02:14.420> sometimes<00:02:15.410> we<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.430> here's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
them sometimes we do that so here's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.250 
them sometimes we do that so here's
about<00:02:20.000> what<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.300> should<00:02:20.450> look<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:20.660> when<00:02:20.900> it's

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
about what it should look like when it's

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.820 
about what it should look like when it's
it's<00:02:21.560> ready<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.220> be<00:02:22.250> taken<00:02:22.640> out<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:24.560> could

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
it's ready to be taken out you could

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
it's ready to be taken out you could
throw<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.310> eggs<00:02:25.490> right<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.970> there<00:02:30.820> but<00:02:31.820> I

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
throw the eggs right in there but I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.970 
throw the eggs right in there but I
prefer<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.239> have<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.510> nice<00:02:32.810> smooth<00:02:33.260> surface<00:02:33.290> for

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
prefer to have a nice smooth surface for

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.920 
prefer to have a nice smooth surface for
the<00:02:34.010> eggs<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:34.970> makes<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.330> easier<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.690> work

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
the eggs just makes it easier to work

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.190 
the eggs just makes it easier to work
with<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.580> now<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.860> vegetables<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.070> meat

with so now that the vegetables and meat
good<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.380> go<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:43.430> going<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> put<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.480> on<00:02:44.540> a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
good to go just going to put that on a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:54.070 
good to go just going to put that on a
plate<00:02:45.459> momentarily

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.180 

and<00:02:55.080> since<00:02:55.380> we've<00:02:55.500> got<00:02:55.620> plenty<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.920> grease

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
and since we've got plenty of grease

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.059 
and since we've got plenty of grease
already<00:02:57.440> just<00:02:58.440> going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> throw<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.950> eggs

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
already just going to throw the eggs

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:07.630 
already just going to throw the eggs
right<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.489> there<00:03:04.610> let<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.640> sit<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.120> minute

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
right in there let it sit for a minute

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.280 
right in there let it sit for a minute
so<00:03:08.640> when<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> eggs<00:03:09.030> are<00:03:09.209> about<00:03:09.330> halfway<00:03:09.780> done

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
so when the eggs are about halfway done

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.820 
so when the eggs are about halfway done
that's<00:03:11.069> when<00:03:11.280> i'll<00:03:11.370> add<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080 
vegetables and meat again and mix it up
a<00:03:22.200> little<00:03:22.230> bit<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:23.340> just<00:03:23.489> easier<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:23.910> work

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
a little bit it's just easier to work

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.330 
a little bit it's just easier to work
with<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.420> eggs<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.900> beginning<00:03:25.250> when<00:03:26.250> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
with the eggs in the beginning when you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.090 
with the eggs in the beginning when you
don't<00:03:26.519> have<00:03:26.670> all<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.030> extras<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.830> there

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
don't have all the extras in there

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.729 
don't have all the extras in there
already<00:03:29.430> but<00:03:30.090> now<00:03:30.209> that's<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.750> eggs<00:03:31.530> are

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
already but now that's the eggs are

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:39.949 
already but now that's the eggs are
mostly<00:03:32.459> cooked<00:03:34.370> it's<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.430> piece<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.670> cake<00:03:38.959> so

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
mostly cooked it's a piece of cake so

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.080 
mostly cooked it's a piece of cake so
when<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.319> eggs<00:03:40.470> are<00:03:40.709> done<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.850> going<00:03:42.000> to

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
when the eggs are done it's going to

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.620 
when the eggs are done it's going to

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
transfer it onto a plate guess it

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.340
