up<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.420> colors<00:02:53.689> will<00:02:53.900> come<00:02:54.109> out<00:02:54.260> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
up on the colors will come out and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.300 
up on the colors will come out and
that's<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.250> basic<00:02:55.670> shape<00:02:55.700> now<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.889> of<00:02:57.889> the

guitars which then needs to be refined
by<00:03:01.159> hand<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:02.299> is<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.569> initial<00:03:02.780> bending

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
by hand this is the initial bending

by hand this is the initial bending
processes<00:03:03.799> this<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.609> process<00:03:05.000> of

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
processes this is the process of

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.479 
processes this is the process of
fine-tuning<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.859> curvature<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.370> the

fine-tuning the the curvature of the

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
sides so what I'm doing is I'm putting

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.740

the<00:03:11.659> timber<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.500> hot<00:03:12.709> iron<00:03:13.629> keeping<00:03:14.629> it

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the timber to the hot iron keeping it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.349 
the timber to the hot iron keeping it
connected<00:03:15.530> contact<00:03:16.430> until<00:03:16.730> it's<00:03:16.879> too<00:03:17.030> hot<00:03:17.209> to

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.599 
connected contact until it's too hot to
touch<00:03:17.389> and<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.379> timber<00:03:18.650> becomes<00:03:18.889> elastic<00:03:19.430> and

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
touch and the timber becomes elastic and

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.270 
touch and the timber becomes elastic and
then<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.060> then<00:03:20.329> form<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.200> final<00:03:21.709> curve<00:03:21.920> into

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
then I then form the final curve into

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.900 
then I then form the final curve into
that<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:23.859> then<00:03:25.000> take<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.120> away<00:03:26.209> let<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.989> cool

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
that and then take it away let it cool

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.129 
that and then take it away let it cool
let<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.030> cool<00:03:29.150> down<00:03:29.209> then<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.599> temper<00:03:29.900> sets

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
let it cool down then the temper sets

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.020 
let it cool down then the temper sets
into<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.500> shape<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.919> want<00:03:31.030> an

into the shape that you want an

assistant sits on a long process of
refinement<00:03:34.879> and<00:03:35.269> it's<00:03:35.930> probably<00:03:36.169> one<00:03:36.319> of<00:03:36.349> the

carved to a certain weight and size so

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.449 
carved to a certain weight and size so
that<00:04:17.930> you've<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:18.590> got<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.919> right<00:04:19.099> amount<00:04:19.400> of

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
flexibility to the top so what I'm doing

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.350 
flexibility to the top so what I'm doing
having<00:04:21.949> drawn<00:04:22.130> out<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.760> pattern<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.610 
strutting system I'm now just marking
the<00:04:27.289> length<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.690> struts<00:04:32.529> snipping<00:04:33.529> them

the length of the struts snipping them

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.200 
the length of the struts snipping them
off<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:40.190> now<00:04:40.340> I've<00:04:40.430> got<00:04:40.639> my<00:04:40.789> arrangement

a<00:04:59.510> Japanese<00:05:00.110> waters<00:05:00.889> day

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
a Japanese waters day

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.870 
a Japanese waters day
it<00:05:03.620> produces<00:05:04.100> an<00:05:04.250> edge<00:05:04.460> like<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.150> razor<00:05:05.510> blade

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880

so<00:05:07.880> I'm<00:05:07.940> just<00:05:08.030> going<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.210> apply<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.450> glue<00:05:08.690> to

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
so I'm just going to apply the glue to

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.740 
so I'm just going to apply the glue to
the<00:05:08.930> strut

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.310 

and<00:05:17.080> then<00:05:17.970> put<00:05:18.970> it<00:05:19.060> in<00:05:19.180> position

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320

strong<00:05:33.639> if<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:33.880> imagine<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.240> curve<00:05:34.539> shape<00:05:34.900> is

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
strong if you imagine a curve shape is

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.770 
strong if you imagine a curve shape is
far<00:05:35.289> more<00:05:35.470> resistant<00:05:35.919> to<00:05:36.190> down<00:05:36.610> push<00:05:36.970> then<00:05:37.750> a

complicated process each tile is angled

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.219 
complicated process each tile is angled
slightly<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:06.789> that<00:06:06.820> it<00:06:07.000> goes<00:06:07.180> round<00:06:07.449> the<00:06:07.810> form

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229
