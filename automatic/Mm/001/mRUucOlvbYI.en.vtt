00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.670 
about it and stuff and I've seen it but
yeah<00:00:32.120> so<00:00:33.120> first<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.230> trucks<00:00:34.530> are

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
yeah so first of all the trucks are

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.190 
yeah so first of all the trucks are
pretty<00:00:34.890> much<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.309> same<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:36.480> can't<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.809> do

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
pretty much the same you can't really do

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.260 
pretty much the same you can't really do
much<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.829> 3<00:00:38.070> inch<00:00:38.219> truck<00:00:38.579> anyways<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
much with the 3 inch truck anyways I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.680 
much with the 3 inch truck anyways I
can't<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:39.930> make<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.620> special<00:00:40.649> anyway

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
can't really make it a special anyway

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
can't really make it a special anyway
but<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> know<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.989> penny<00:00:43.230> boards<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
but I know the penny boards have the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.150 
but I know the penny boards have the
logo<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.510> trucks<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.649> least<00:00:46.829> most<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
logo on the trucks or at least most of

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.420 
logo on the trucks or at least most of
them<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:49.379> bearings<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> penny<00:00:50.190> board

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
them do the bearings on the penny board

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.889 
them do the bearings on the penny board
are<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.879> better<00:00:51.120> than<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> stock<00:00:51.660> brands

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
are a lot better than the stock brands

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.389 
are a lot better than the stock brands
that<00:00:52.110> come<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> stereo<00:00:52.829> Bonner<00:00:53.039> Cruiser

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that come with the stereo Bonner Cruiser

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.660 
that come with the stereo Bonner Cruiser
however<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> board<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.590> well<00:00:56.460> as

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
however if you get the board as well as

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.150 
however if you get the board as well as
the<00:00:56.879> Reds<00:00:57.149> it'll<00:00:57.629> still<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.079> cheaper<00:00:58.710> than

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the Reds it'll still be cheaper than

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
the Reds it'll still be cheaper than
getting<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.670> penny<00:00:59.910> board<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.870> money<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> an

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
getting a penny board so if money is an

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
getting a penny board so if money is an
issue<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> stereo<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
issue then just get the stereo on a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
issue then just get the stereo on a
cruiser<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.619> Reds<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> you'll<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.060> set

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
cruiser with some Reds and you'll be set

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
cruiser with some Reds and you'll be set

to go yeah so one of the things to be
worried<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.340> hardware<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.880> not

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
set up more than something else I guess

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.199 
set up more than something else I guess
yeah<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:05.340> board<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.729> pretty<00:02:06.570> good<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
yeah so this board is pretty good the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.770 
yeah so this board is pretty good the
main<00:02:09.420> thing<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.899> focus<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.220> hardware

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
main thing to focus on is the hardware

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.870 
main thing to focus on is the hardware
bearings<00:02:12.780> aren't<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.080> great<00:02:13.290> when<00:02:13.650> you

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
bearings aren't that great when you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.660 
bearings aren't that great when you
get<00:02:14.270> them<00:02:14.980> actually<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.040> haven't<00:02:16.280> even<00:02:16.370> broken

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
get them actually I haven't even broken

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.970 
get them actually I haven't even broken
in<00:02:16.970> my<00:02:17.570> stock<00:02:17.840> bearings<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.470> put<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:18.740> Reds

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
in my stock bearings I just put my Reds

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.080 
in my stock bearings I just put my Reds
right<00:02:19.250> when<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> got<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:21.340> board<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.940> like

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
right when I got the board I just like

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.510 
right when I got the board I just like
switching<00:02:23.810> about<00:02:24.170> him<00:02:24.320> immediately<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.130> wrote

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
switching about him immediately I wrote

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.640 
switching about him immediately I wrote
the<00:02:26.360> stock<00:02:26.600> bearings<00:02:26.930> for<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.140> little<00:02:27.350> bit<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the stock bearings for a little bit and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.720 
the stock bearings for a little bit and
I<00:02:27.740> didn't<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.250> at<00:02:28.340> all<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> just

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
I didn't like it at all so I just

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.110 
I didn't like it at all so I just
switched<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.270> out<00:02:30.460> and<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.700> did<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.090> just

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
switched it out and I did that just

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.660 
switched it out and I did that just
because<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.660> have<00:02:32.810> Reds<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.830> my<00:02:34.010> skateboard<00:02:34.550> and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
because I have Reds in my skateboard and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.660 
because I have Reds in my skateboard and
I<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.060> way<00:02:35.180> Reds<00:02:35.780> like<00:02:36.500> spin<00:02:36.860> or<00:02:37.130> how

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
I like the way Reds like spin or how

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.310 
I like the way Reds like spin or how
long<00:02:37.820> that's<00:02:38.060> been<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.780> quality<00:02:39.230> of

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
long that's been for and the quality of

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.310 
long that's been for and the quality of
the<00:02:39.440> bearings<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:39.860> stuff<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.340> yeah<00:02:41.290> um<00:02:42.940> yeah

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
stereo vinyl Cruiser because it is a

stereo vinyl Cruiser and not a penny
board<00:03:06.070> but<00:03:07.070> yeah<00:03:07.570> also<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.930> main<00:03:09.380> difference

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
board but yeah also the main difference

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.370 
board but yeah also the main difference
is<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.430> grip<00:03:10.720> which<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:12.050> people<00:03:12.260> focus

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
is the grip which a lot of people focus

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.090 
is the grip which a lot of people focus
on<00:03:13.150> honestly<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.450> me<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.410> selling<00:03:15.740> point<00:03:15.950> was

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
on honestly for me the selling point was

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.570 
on honestly for me the selling point was
the<00:03:16.280> price<00:03:16.610> I<00:03:17.680> thought<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.040> was<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.310> better

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
the price I thought that it was a better

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.160 
the price I thought that it was a better
deal<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:20.030> get<00:03:20.180> super<00:03:21.050> awesome<00:03:21.380> bearings<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:22.040> a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
deal to get super awesome bearings and a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.000 
deal to get super awesome bearings and a
decent<00:03:24.170> board<00:03:25.930> for<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.960> less<00:03:27.200> than<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.500> would<00:03:27.650> to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
decent board for a less than it would to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
get a penny and I know some pennies run

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.950 
get a penny and I know some pennies run
for<00:03:30.500> like<00:03:30.650> 90<00:03:31.250> something<00:03:31.490> dollars<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.210> I've

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
are looking to get one for Christmas I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.690 
are looking to get one for Christmas I
would<00:03:45.650> recommend<00:03:46.160> getting<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:48.110> penny

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
would recommend getting like the penny

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.690 
would recommend getting like the penny
just<00:03:49.700> because<00:03:50.090> I'm<00:03:50.870> sure<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.980> less<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.640> a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
just because I'm sure it's less of a

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.230 
just because I'm sure it's less of a
hassle<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.240> have<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.480> deal<00:03:53.630> with<00:03:53.660> like<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:55.240> skate

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
hassle to have to deal with like a skate

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.630 
hassle to have to deal with like a skate
tool<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.840> then<00:03:57.260> have<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.530> like<00:03:57.950> bring<00:03:58.370> other

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
tool and then have to like bring other

tool and then have to like bring other
tools<00:03:59.600> along<00:03:59.810> if<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:00.260> bring<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.590> along<00:04:00.860> with

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
tools along if you bring this along with

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.620 
tools along if you bring this along with

your skateboard or something if that

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.720 
your skateboard or something if that
makes<00:04:02.840> sense
