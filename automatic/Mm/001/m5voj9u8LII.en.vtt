00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.359
 the obesity epidemic explains in 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.359
 three minutes 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.530
 about 1 9 million children in germany 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.480
 are overweight of it 800,000 even 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.130
 obese 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.710
 in the last 20 years is the share 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.260
 overweight children by 50 percent 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.670
 increased 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.949
 we are looking forward to that 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.529
 but something on the plate lands 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.750
 six to eleven-year-old children more than 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.550
 twice as many confectionery but only half 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.290
 as much fruit and vegetables as recommended 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.550
 becomes 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.020
 no wonder if you look at the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.660
 Advertising issues of the food industry 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.640
 looking for sweets it is more than 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.760
 700 million euros a year 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 that it's more than 35 times as much as for 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.750
 fruit and vegetables 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.449
 the money is from the manufacturer's point of view 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.520
 well invested because sweets bring the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:59.469
 Biggest winner of overweight 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.370
 So our children benefit alone 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.290
 the food industry the bill 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.930
 pay the children and we as 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.090
 society alone in health care 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.240
 caused by obesity costs 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.670
 of more than 20 billion euros each 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.200
 year 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.420
 to avoid such diseases before 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.520
 they are supposed to be the goal of 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.080
 so-called prevention law over it 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.700
 that was soon agreed in the Bundestag 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.360
 becomes 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.400
 Doctors up to the high 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.870
 World Health Organization 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.880
 recommendations for combating 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.160
 overweight and obesity 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.010
 developed to include restrictions 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.470
 for a children's marketing 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.670
 control on unhealthy foods 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.040
 targeted subsidy healthy 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.740
 food binding standards for 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.010
 school meals programs for the reduction of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.640
 sugar or salt in food 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.190
 consumer friendly labels in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.380
 Nutritional education and 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.509
 movement promotion 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.219
 the food industry stops by 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.079
 Not much of these suggestions 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.189
 nutrition education and exercise promotion 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.100
 let alone 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.840
 why, simply because you do not have it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.610
 the cross comes further and thick 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.469
 to win as before and completely 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.300
 incidentally, the industry can do so 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.519
 black peter fully the oh so 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.730
 many children and so willing 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.400
 push weak parents 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 And what is the Federal Government doing? 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.040
 That's exactly what they are 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.040
 food industry wishes 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.380
 doctor margaret chan 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.390
 the boss of 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.400
 World Health Organization criticized 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.890
 such behavior of governments 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.319
 quote not a single state has it 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.970
 managed the obesity epidemic in 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.160
 to stop all ages 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.140
 here there is no lack of individual 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.790
 Willpower here is lacking 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.720
 political sake with one 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.940
 to create big industry we find 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.069
 the politicians should be in front of dr hans 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.569
 write words to heart 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.049
 now to the deputies in the German 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.579
 Bundestag and demand an effective one 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.380
 prevention law obesity 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.380
 epidemic must be stopped
