fellow appearing in this review you have
this<00:00:20.180> one<00:00:20.980> during<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.130> review<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:22.640> said<00:00:23.060> that

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
this one during that review I said that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.840 
this one during that review I said that
building<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.140> figure<00:00:24.620> takes<00:00:25.130> about<00:00:25.340> five

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
building this figure takes about five

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.460 
building this figure takes about five
minutes<00:00:25.880> if<00:00:26.420> you<00:00:26.540> are<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.660> standard<00:00:26.960> grade

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
minutes if you are a standard grade

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.029 
minutes if you are a standard grade
builder<00:00:28.280> and<00:00:28.520> I<00:00:29.150> was<00:00:29.300> thinking<00:00:29.840> over<00:00:30.050> time<00:00:30.410> why

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
builder and I was thinking over time why

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.520 
builder and I was thinking over time why
not<00:00:31.070> try<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:31.910> prove<00:00:32.300> this<00:00:32.480> theory<00:00:32.960> in<00:00:33.140> a

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
not try to prove this theory in a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.619 
not try to prove this theory in a
real-time<00:00:33.739> video<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:34.969> what<00:00:35.120> I'm<00:00:35.239> going<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.480> do

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
real-time video so what I'm going to do

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.470 
real-time video so what I'm going to do
now<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.379> take<00:00:37.160> apart<00:00:37.489> my<00:00:37.579> Bionicle<00:00:38.149> Tahu

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
now is to take apart my Bionicle Tahu

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.729 
now is to take apart my Bionicle Tahu
and<00:00:38.690> build<00:00:39.289> them<00:00:39.440> again<00:00:39.680> on<00:00:39.890> camera<00:00:41.440> so<00:00:42.440> I

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
and build them again on camera so I

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.590 
and build them again on camera so I
think<00:00:43.579> it's<00:00:43.880> time<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.120> begin<00:00:44.239> this<00:00:44.420> little

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
think it's time to begin this little

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.510 
think it's time to begin this little
experiment<00:00:46.720> let's<00:00:47.720> do<00:00:47.930> it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
experiment let's do it

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.930 
experiment let's do it
all<00:00:49.520> in<00:00:49.760> all<00:00:49.940> Tahu<00:00:50.660> is<00:00:50.840> made<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.440> 32<00:00:52.190> parts<00:00:52.610> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
all in all Tahu is made of 32 parts and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.910 
all in all Tahu is made of 32 parts and
let's<00:00:53.329> see<00:00:53.510> how<00:00:53.780> fast<00:00:54.079> we<00:00:54.290> can<00:00:54.559> bring<00:00:54.770> them

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
let's see how fast we can bring them

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.430 
let's see how fast we can bring them
together<00:00:55.090> we'll<00:00:56.090> start<00:00:56.390> off<00:00:56.690> by<00:00:56.930> building<00:00:57.110> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
together we'll start off by building the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.040 
together we'll start off by building the
torso<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.850> will<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.059> take<00:00:59.329> this<00:00:59.600> large<00:00:59.840> piece

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
torso so will you take this large piece

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.430 
torso so will you take this large piece
and<00:01:00.320> we<00:01:00.530> take<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:01.180> five-block<00:01:02.180> Paul<00:01:03.170> piece

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
and we take a five-block Paul piece

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.499 
and we take a five-block Paul piece
these<00:01:03.710> black<00:01:03.980> ones<00:01:04.009> we<00:01:04.969> push<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.329> through

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
these black ones we push this through

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.510 
these black ones we push this through
here<00:01:07.000> like<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.479> now<00:01:09.049> we<00:01:09.110> use<00:01:09.500> this<00:01:10.219> part

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
here like this and now we use this part

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.419 
here like this and now we use this part
and<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:11.569> part<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:12.109> is<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.289> block<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:13.310> block

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
and this part this is a block to block

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.520 
and this part this is a block to block
Paul<00:01:14.179> that<00:01:14.389> is<00:01:14.420> characteristic<00:01:15.170> by<00:01:15.259> having

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
Paul that is characteristic by having

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.529 
Paul that is characteristic by having
two<00:01:15.709> notches<00:01:15.920> near<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.850> sides<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.270> hope<00:01:17.450> you

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
two notches near the sides I hope you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.529 
two notches near the sides I hope you
can<00:01:17.659> see<00:01:17.780> this<00:01:17.929> right<00:01:18.229> like<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:19.539> push

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
can see this right like that we push

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.109 
can see this right like that we push
this<00:01:20.689> in<00:01:20.959> here<00:01:21.289> and<00:01:21.439> we<00:01:21.709> place<00:01:22.069> this<00:01:22.399> in<00:01:22.729> this

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
this in here and we place this in this

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.949 
this in here and we place this in this
slot<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.200> base<00:01:24.319> of<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.709> torso<00:01:25.069> this<00:01:25.959> now

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
slot in the base of the torso this now

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.069 
slot in the base of the torso this now
we<00:01:27.439> can<00:01:27.619> take<00:01:27.829> this<00:01:28.369> piece<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.999> puts<00:01:29.450> in<00:01:29.659> here

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
we can take this piece and puts in here

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.590 
we can take this piece and puts in here
and<00:01:30.999> we<00:01:31.999> can<00:01:32.179> drop<00:01:32.420> in<00:01:32.749> the<00:01:33.439> keys<00:01:33.679> so<00:01:34.520> they<00:01:34.729> want

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
and we can drop in the keys so they want

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.910 
and we can drop in the keys so they want
to<00:01:35.659> fall<00:01:35.840> out<00:01:35.869> easily<00:01:36.259> because<00:01:36.590> they<00:01:36.889> are

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
to fall out easily because they are

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.339 
to fall out easily because they are
designed<00:01:37.099> to<00:01:37.369> not<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.329> fall<00:01:38.509> off<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.200> it's

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
designed to not to fall off so it's

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.649 
designed to not to fall off so it's
going<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:39.560> be<00:01:39.649> nice<00:01:39.859> now<00:01:40.609> we<00:01:40.639> can<00:01:40.849> take<00:01:41.029> two

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
going to be nice now we can take two

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.440 
going to be nice now we can take two
three<00:01:42.170> block<00:01:42.619> pieces<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.310> push<00:01:43.579> them<00:01:43.729> in<00:01:44.090> like

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
three block pieces and push them in like

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.709 
three block pieces and push them in like
this<00:01:45.459> over<00:01:46.459> this<00:01:46.579> part<00:01:46.789> just<00:01:47.119> fall<00:01:47.630> off

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
this over this part just fall off

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.449 
this over this part just fall off
because<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:48.139> not<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.469> gear<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.159> it's<00:01:49.340> gonna

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
because it's not a gear so it's gonna

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.089 
because it's not a gear so it's gonna
fall<00:01:49.700> off<00:01:49.729> easy<00:01:50.409> no<00:01:51.409> problem<00:01:51.740> at<00:01:51.799> all

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
fall off easy no problem at all

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.179 
fall off easy no problem at all
this<00:01:52.689> great<00:01:53.689> now<00:01:54.259> we<00:01:54.319> can<00:01:54.499> take<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.979> needle

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
this great now we can take a needle

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.230 
this great now we can take a needle
through<00:01:55.939> block<00:01:56.209> put<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:56.959> in<00:01:57.049> here<00:01:57.349> and<00:01:58.240> add

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
through block put it in here and add

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.089 
through block put it in here and add
this<00:01:59.979> sphere<00:02:00.979> like<00:02:01.130> finger<00:02:01.609> and<00:02:01.819> pushes<00:02:02.599> here

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
this sphere like finger and pushes here

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.909 
this sphere like finger and pushes here
we<00:02:04.099> have<00:02:04.249> a<00:02:04.279> decoration<00:02:04.609> so<00:02:05.539> now<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:05.869> take<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:06.919 
we have a decoration so now we take the

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:10.089 
we have a decoration so now we take the
large<00:02:07.130> six<00:02:07.759> block<00:02:08.060> Paul<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:09.470> push<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:09.890> in

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
large six block Paul and we push it in

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.979 
large six block Paul and we push it in
here<00:02:10.429> from<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.819> backside<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.510> think<00:02:11.870> that's

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
here from the backside I think that's

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.410 
here from the backside I think that's
easier<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.700> we<00:02:14.510> take<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.140> bigger<00:02:15.620> gear<00:02:16.180> here<00:02:17.180> and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
easier so we take a bigger gear here and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.980 
easier so we take a bigger gear here and
now<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.350> seal<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.800> off<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.220> two<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.730> know

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
now we seal it off with two I know

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.930 
now we seal it off with two I know
pluck<00:02:21.650> pieces<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.340> doesn't<00:02:22.610> matter<00:02:22.730> whether

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
pluck pieces it doesn't matter whether

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.970 
pluck pieces it doesn't matter whether
you<00:02:23.090> put<00:02:23.270> them<00:02:23.450> with<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.290> coarse<00:02:24.530> fingers

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
you put them with the coarse fingers

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.880 
you put them with the coarse fingers
pointing<00:02:25.640> four<00:02:25.850> forwards<00:02:26.720> or<00:02:26.810> backwards

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
pointing four forwards or backwards

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.880 
pointing four forwards or backwards
let's<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.100> match<00:02:28.280> up<00:02:28.400> your<00:02:28.490> preference<00:02:29.890> so

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.860 
let's just match up your preference so
now<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.100> have<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> torso<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.210> we<00:02:32.510> can<00:02:32.660> build

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
now we have the torso and we can build

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.590 
now we have the torso and we can build
off<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.380> limbs<00:02:34.000> nothing<00:02:35.000> very<00:02:35.150> hard

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
we take defeat take the leg part snaps

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.130 
we take defeat take the leg part snaps
in<00:02:41.150> nicely<00:02:41.570> we<00:02:42.380> top<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.130> with<00:02:43.580> black<00:02:44.060> joint<00:02:44.450> so

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
in nicely we top it with black joint so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.300 
in nicely we top it with black joint so
we<00:02:45.770> do<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> same<00:02:46.220> second<00:02:46.760> time<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.470> feet

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
we do the same second time so feet

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.810 
we do the same second time so feet
leg<00:02:50.590> snap<00:02:51.590> one<00:02:52.240> joint<00:02:53.800> snap<00:02:54.800> -<00:02:55.040> we<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.550> two

part and this part snap them together

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.300 
part and this part snap them together
use<00:03:05.030> two<00:03:05.420> free<00:03:06.110> block<00:03:06.320> pieces<00:03:06.770> put<00:03:07.100> them<00:03:07.220> in

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
use two free block pieces put them in

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.430 
use two free block pieces put them in
here<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.900> so

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
here like so

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.800 
here like so
we<00:03:10.040> got<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.370> arm<00:03:10.580> except<00:03:11.120> for<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.450> fact<00:03:11.660> we

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
we got the arm except for this fact we

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.700 
we got the arm except for this fact we
need<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.110> plug<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.820> like<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.330> now

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
need to plug this in like so and now

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.330 
need to plug this in like so and now
sort<00:03:15.710> handling<00:03:16.460> hand<00:03:16.820> arm<00:03:17.950> take<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.100> piece

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
sort handling hand arm take this piece

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.400 
sort handling hand arm take this piece
and<00:03:19.490> this<00:03:19.640> piece<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:20.210> prefer<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.900> usually<00:03:21.230> put

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
and this piece I prefer to usually put

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.610 
and this piece I prefer to usually put
it<00:03:21.560> like<00:03:21.710> this<00:03:23.050> because<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.140> looks<00:03:24.260> slightly

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
it like this because it looks slightly

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.540 
it like this because it looks slightly
less<00:03:25.040> slightly<00:03:25.550> more<00:03:25.700> cool<00:03:25.960> we<00:03:26.960> do<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:27.550> plug

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
less slightly more cool we do this plug

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.920 
less slightly more cool we do this plug
this<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:30.070> we<00:03:31.070> have<00:03:31.600> little<00:03:32.600> limbs

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
this in and we have little limbs

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.290 
this in and we have little limbs
complete<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:33.830> now<00:03:33.860> we<00:03:34.190> can<00:03:34.370> put<00:03:34.640> them<00:03:34.820> onto<00:03:35.030> the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
complete so now we can put them onto the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.130 
complete so now we can put them onto the
figure<00:03:37.150> very<00:03:38.150> simple<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:41.000> we<00:03:41.750> just<00:03:41.930> make<00:03:42.110> sure

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
figure very simple so we just make sure

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.590 
figure very simple so we just make sure
they<00:03:42.620> will<00:03:42.740> not<00:03:42.980> pull<00:03:43.220> off<00:03:43.370> on<00:03:43.550> us<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:44.450> they

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
they will not pull off on us and they

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.130 
they will not pull off on us and they
split<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.350> make<00:03:46.010> attaching<00:03:46.490> these<00:03:46.640> easier<00:03:47.240> so

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
split to make attaching these easier so

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.830 
split to make attaching these easier so
like<00:03:48.350> this<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.510> like<00:03:50.510> this

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
like this and like this

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890 
like this and like this
and<00:03:54.340> now<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.400> final<00:03:55.730> touch<00:03:56.000> we<00:03:56.480> build<00:03:56.690> them

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
and now the final touch we build them

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.680 
and now the final touch we build them
head<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.650> we<00:03:57.710> take<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.070> last<00:03:58.280> free<00:03:58.610> block<00:03:58.820> push

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
head so we take the last free block push

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.760 
head so we take the last free block push
it<00:03:59.810> in<00:03:59.960> here<00:04:00.520> take<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.670> head<00:04:02.290> lock<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.470> through

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770
