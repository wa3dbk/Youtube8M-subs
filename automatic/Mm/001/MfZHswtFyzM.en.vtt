00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.099
 while we are taking her shower 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.030
 go here to learn how we 1.6 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.549
 and what makes 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.080
 is point 6 the first point that people 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.680
 learn when it's starting, I learned how 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.539
 and I 've already started a bit to 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.900
 show him how he's getting 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.630
 you have this little bunch here and how 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.500
 people come here in this little bunch I go 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.439
 show is I'm going to put my needle 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 here opening the point 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.390
 I'm going to throw it back here. 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.489
 done that point is already done then 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.579
 I can overthrow this one by which I 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.309
 I spent the wire inside it complicated 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.870
 Let's do it over here, I have one. 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.590
 point already on the needle 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 Okay, I'll catch it this way . 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.329
 backwards opening in this way 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.570
 and here I am going to do a lace lace wire 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.550
 passes through the point I can already 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.220
 I'll bring it down because it will not fall over here. 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.869
 and stay safe 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.570
 let's go from front to back 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.420
 tie thread behind my work 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.060
 step inside the point in this way 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.799
 and then I already drop the point that is here 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.439
 on the needle, that's all 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.869
 and to make the stitch knitting the stitch became 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.240
 it is half inside out so that side 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.020
 we have necessarily done this 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.600
 Here's where these little balls go. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.060
 is the knitting and the time we made is the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.640
 weakness of that side necessarily 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.070
 on the other it will look like this 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.020
 half point is this shows that a show 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.270
 I already know why it is done in 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.990
 Item 6 on the one hand and as was the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.860
 other 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.229
 This is how we do it. 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.840
 make the golf point is in front of the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.930
 I work that way and I'm going to 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.570
 my needle is here in front, I will not 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.560
 threading from right to left and I 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.450
 I'll pass the wire in this way. 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.209
 over the needle 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.180
 done it, we released it that way, I'm going 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.590
 withdraw this throw inside the point 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.129
 that was already in the needle 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.519
 and then I can knock over the point 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.739
 this way we're going to stick it again 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.550
 needles in front of the right work 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.130
 to the left 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.630
 This way I'm going to spend this movie. 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.540
 it's here in my hand the movie brings 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.750
 still the government over the needle 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.470
 that way and I'll pass on this 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.220
 I went back inside the way that way. 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.700
 and when I do that I drop point 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.400
 once more I pass the needle of the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.950
 right here searches the front passes the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:04.019
 thread over the needle and I 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.170
 and drop the previous career point 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.170
 like this
