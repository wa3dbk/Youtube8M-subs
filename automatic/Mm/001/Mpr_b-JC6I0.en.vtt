00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 there are friends here here 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.690
 I'm going to show you an application for 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.030
 iphone that a student passed me does 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.670
 several weeks the truth is very good 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.350
 What does the application consist of? 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.369
 serves to study scales and power 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.140
 identify them by ear or identify their 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.180
 respective alterations in the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 staff to know how they are written 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.789
 how they are interpreted and so on is very 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.710
 good the truth serves a lot I have 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.360
 asked if there is for the system 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 Android, the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.730
 get for iphone 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.220
 so we would have to investigate if there 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.500
 for android then this video is for 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.900
 those who were interested in this 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.090
 application when I started posting 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.900
 some things about her on twitter 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.670
 etcetera then to see what you think 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.550
 and well then once they have 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.640
 your application is installed 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.680
 there is the select the open it so it goes to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.320
 appear there are the instructions you 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.290
 they give ok and now we do have in the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 little leaf we have the root of the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.350
 scale in this case is the but if 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.410
 they want they can change it can be the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.930
 has been re my fa sun any of the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.360
 other notes we're going to leave it in the and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 can even alter the root can be 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.400
 the sharp or the flat or the natural 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.230
 so let's leave it for now 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 there is the scale is the same as 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.400
 thrown long ago is the first this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.730
 each block of scales has 5 there is 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.770
 the 1 of 5 and good for what is this 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.650
 little button is to hide the notes of 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.890
 soon if they want to make it more complicated 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.900
 the challenge let's read the moment there 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.970
 is even if they read them because they already 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.310
 can give an idea of what scale it would be 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.070
 without needing to listen to it but good 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.780
 the idea is to be able to listen also here 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.729
 They give play and will play in 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.310
 top down if they want what 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.460
 would listen several times without stopping him 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.920
 They give in whip it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.920
 and well this bar below is for 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.900
 increase or decrease the time of the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.760
 reproduction obviously between faster 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.180
 this cep has given you then it's going to be more 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.040
 difficult to identify by ear the scale to 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.440
 the first 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.080
 good here where is it comes now if everything 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.510
 the list of options larger scale 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.730
 natural minor the seven modes of the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.050
 scale greater ionic doric frigio el 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.530
 solid wind language I believe it well in the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.170
 modes of the minor melodic is already lower 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.960
 doric flat 2 read increased the idea 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 dominant in the solid and we see 6 what 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.160
 with second increased or second major 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.780
 how do you want to see it super I believe it or 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.600
 altered from dominant as they want 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.900
 see well in the minor modes 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:04.210
 harmonic also 12 mode 3 mode 4 567 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.790
 minor 30 major pentatonic tonic and 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:11.110
 blues finally those are all the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.220
 options that have in response 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.040
 now we are going to give them to go listen 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.940
 people this is this scale that we have 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.940
 here that is the first 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.560
 the return 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.780
 can even adjust the volume if 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.300
 they want 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.730
 and well what I hear is a 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.700
 scale of the major scale since 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.110
 we have a third major there and all 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.800
 the other grades are natural not 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.360
 so he's not talking about what a 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.460
 solid mix 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.520
 6 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.880
 we look for solid mix -6 here is that 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.170
 is the fifth mode of the minor 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.480
 melodic we give you in guess is right 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.230
 1.006 solid mic is correct 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.830
 next scale and we prick and throw a 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.060
 new we continue in that root is not going to 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.760
 change unless you do 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.410
 manually let's leave this in also 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.800
 but to see what scale is we going to 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.800
 hear 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.930
 this is 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:40.419
 is the seventh mode mode 7 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.490
 the smallest harmonica then we look for it 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:50.080
 harmonic greater mode 7 here is 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.330
 we selected 10 is correct america 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.660
 minor mode 7 is correct next 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.280
 scale and throw a new one and then for 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.199
 Do not say what I'm doing 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.480
 scam we're going to change to the root 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.580
 let's put him 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.270
 retained 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.240
 and we're going to hide the notes for 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.960
 just listen and see what wave 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.740
 this scale 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.740
 and we produce 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.930
 this is an enlarged lily 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.270
 is the third mode of the minor scale 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.270
 melodica we look for lidio augmented 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.490
 how much gone increased is 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.530
 is correct and is increased is correct 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.539
 we are missing two more scales for this 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.620
 round each round has five scales 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:50.940
 different and the va is throwing them 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.560
 chance does not always do the same 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.160
 repetitions and the more you play it 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.560
 the more they are with the application the more 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.460
 to reveal more scales of all types 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.810
 missing is going to this is going to play 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.150
 let's increase a little bit here the 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.830
 speed 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.220
 and let's play to see what it is 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.220
 about 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:22.410
 this is the second mode 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.170
 of the minor harmonica then looked to 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:30.240
 Munich and Maynor 2 2 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:33.720
 there is 10 is correct 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.820
 amorim there are rules 2 is correct and comes 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.260
 the last scale of this series 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:43.290
 of 5 to touch the let's change the one that 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.890
 do not say that I am the clown for 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.890
 put sun 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.190
 there are no notes here we will see what is 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:01.379
 and well this was easy until that 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.479
 it can even be a natural minor or 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.340
 can be a neo-liberal any of the 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:09.390
 correct answer voices let's leave it 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.529
 in natural minor that is correct 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.409
 finished 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:16.409
 and now you have the option to make a 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:20.499
 new round of five different scales 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:23.670
 and you can see how successful it is being 

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:25.470
 as you go practicing 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.780
 or alternatively they can close the 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.580
 application and ready 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.770
 well there they had it as you can see it is 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.040
 quite useful really serves to be able 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.850
 identify scales of hearing or for 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.130
 can they write know their alterations 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.250
 so then they recommend to 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.889
 that can study this topic also 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:49.540
 extensive in music and put on 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:51.250
 study scales better instead of being 

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.950
 asking them to give them lives for the 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.800
 candy crochet if those blowjobs the 

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.810
 you need and this good if you liked it 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.200
 download the is free do not occupy 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:05.020
 a lot of memory space easy to use and 

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.600
 really effective then that's all 

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.600
 for this occasion until next time
