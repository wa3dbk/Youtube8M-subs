00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
ship so today we're doing something a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.579 
ship so today we're doing something a
little<00:00:06.750> bit<00:00:06.899> different

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
little bit different

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.410 
little bit different
I<00:00:07.620> received<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:08.429> leap<00:00:08.670> motion<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> other<00:00:09.240> day

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
I received my leap motion the other day

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.870 
I received my leap motion the other day
and<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:10.349> course<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.160> first<00:00:11.370> thing<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.849> I

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
and of course the first thing that I

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.360 
and of course the first thing that I
thought<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.740> how<00:00:13.740> does<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.980> work<00:00:14.099> with

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
thought of was how does it work with

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.689 
thought of was how does it work with
gaming<00:00:15.080> namely<00:00:16.080> first-person<00:00:16.740> shooters<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.670> I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
gaming namely first-person shooters so I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.330 
gaming namely first-person shooters so I
looked<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.060> air<00:00:18.480> space<00:00:18.750> stalk<00:00:19.050> yes<00:00:19.830> yes

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
looked on the air space stalk yes yes

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.179 
looked on the air space stalk yes yes
face<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:21.900> initially<00:00:22.740> couldn't<00:00:22.949> really<00:00:23.039> see

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
face and I initially couldn't really see

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830 
face and I initially couldn't really see
anything<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> came<00:00:23.939> across<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.510> app

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
anything but then I came across a app

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.400 
anything but then I came across a app
called<00:00:25.170> game<00:00:25.800> wave<00:00:26.070> which<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:26.939> pretty<00:00:27.449> cool<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
called game wave which is pretty cool it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.310 
called game wave which is pretty cool it
allows<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> set<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.660> custom<00:00:30.660> profiles<00:00:31.109> for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
allows you to set up custom profiles for

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.250 
allows you to set up custom profiles for
different<00:00:31.590> things<00:00:32.149> even<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.180> using<00:00:33.899> Windows

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
different things even just using Windows

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.670

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
their sides because obviously in fps you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
their sides because obviously in fps you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
may be doing full circle sort of thing

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.590 
may be doing full circle sort of thing
and<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.710> looking<00:01:46.950> around<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.479> you're

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
looking around you might go out of the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.810 
looking around you might go out of the
range<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.110> leap<00:01:52.950> motion<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.460> it'll<00:01:53.640> start

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
range of the leap motion and it'll start

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.840 
range of the leap motion and it'll start
to<00:01:53.939> freak<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.840> put<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.079> hand<00:01:55.229> sideways

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
to freak out so put your hand sideways

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.039 
to freak out so put your hand sideways
bring<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.909> back<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> center<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.869> then

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
bring it back to the center and then

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.420 
bring it back to the center and then
start<00:01:58.890> looking<00:01:58.950> around<00:01:59.130> again<00:02:00.229> also

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
start looking around again also

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.469 
start looking around again also
similarly<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.640> when<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> start<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> bump<00:02:03.360> into

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
similarly to when you start to bump into

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.240 
similarly to when you start to bump into
your<00:02:03.600> other<00:02:03.689> hand<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> I've<00:02:05.520> got<00:02:05.759> shoot<00:02:06.149> set<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
your other hand so I've got shoot set to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
your other hand so I've got shoot set to
when<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> close<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:08.670> left<00:02:09.330> hand

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
when I close my left hand

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.230 
when I close my left hand
now<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.009> found<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.490> be<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:12.060> bit

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
now I found this can be a little bit

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.670 
now I found this can be a little bit
confusing<00:02:14.450> when<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.780> are<00:02:16.140> doing<00:02:16.500> two<00:02:16.650> things

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
confusing when you are doing two things

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.440 
confusing when you are doing two things
with<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.130> hand<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.520> if<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.090> moving<00:02:18.360> around

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
with one hand so if I'm moving around

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.600 
with one hand so if I'm moving around
and<00:02:18.930> trying<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.350> shoot<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.709> same<00:02:19.860> fun<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.370> might

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and trying to shoot the same fun I might

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.980 
and trying to shoot the same fun I might
accidentally<00:02:21.000> start<00:02:21.330> moving<00:02:21.600> left<00:02:21.810> or

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
accidentally start moving left or

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.500 
accidentally start moving left or
Batgirl<00:02:22.260> right<00:02:23.100> or<00:02:23.280> all<00:02:23.430> over<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.670> place<00:02:23.880> when

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
Batgirl right or all over the place when

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.170 
Batgirl right or all over the place when
I<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:24.870> mean<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.820> just<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.910> show<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> guys

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
I don't mean it so just to show you guys

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.390 
I don't mean it so just to show you guys
a<00:02:27.300> little<00:02:27.570> bit<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.810> basic<00:02:28.590> combat<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.160> Garry's

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
a little bit of basic combat and Garry's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.580 
a little bit of basic combat and Garry's
Mod<00:02:29.430> by<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> way<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.690> we'll<00:02:31.020> go<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:31.320> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
Mod by the way so we'll go up here and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.699 
Mod by the way so we'll go up here and
just<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.790> some<00:02:33.030> B's<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:37.200> alright<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.590> you're

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
just do some B's it's alright if you're

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.350 
just do some B's it's alright if you're
standing<00:02:37.980> still<00:02:39.020> I'm<00:02:40.020> shooting<00:02:41.239> but<00:02:44.120> yeah<00:02:45.120> it

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
standing still I'm shooting but yeah it

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.270 
standing still I'm shooting but yeah it
can<00:02:45.570> be<00:02:45.600> pretty<00:02:45.750> difficult<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:47.040> I've<00:02:47.130> only

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
can be pretty difficult now I've only

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.920 
can be pretty difficult now I've only
had<00:02:47.580> about<00:02:47.700> half<00:02:48.090> an<00:02:48.239> hour's<00:02:48.360> practice<00:02:48.810> on

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
had about half an hour's practice on

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.949 
had about half an hour's practice on
this<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.560> far<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.970> think<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.709> you

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
this so far I think you know if you

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.790 
this so far I think you know if you
played<00:02:54.959> with<00:02:56.390> some<00:02:57.650> pretty<00:02:58.650> useful<00:02:59.420> it's<00:03:00.420> just

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
played with some pretty useful it's just

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.199 
played with some pretty useful it's just
it<00:03:01.800> would<00:03:01.890> take<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.310> lot<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.640> getting<00:03:02.850> used<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
it would take a lot of getting used to

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.140 
it would take a lot of getting used to
and<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> lot<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> practice

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and a lot of practice

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.300 
and a lot of practice
honestly<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:08.630> well<00:03:09.800> used<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.950> haunt<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.190> at

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
honestly it's well used to haunt you at

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.400 
honestly it's well used to haunt you at
me<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:12.180> also<00:03:12.330> noticed<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.870> tends<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.110> jump

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
me you also noticed it tends to jump

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.170 
me you also noticed it tends to jump
around<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.800> little<00:03:13.890> bit<00:03:14.100> at<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.250> moment<00:03:14.280> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
around a little bit at the moment I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.270 
around a little bit at the moment I
don't<00:03:16.079> know<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.260> that's<00:03:16.440> just<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.829> leap<00:03:17.040> or

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
don't know if that's just the leap or

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.530 
don't know if that's just the leap or
the<00:03:17.430> perfect<00:03:18.079> game<00:03:19.079> wave<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:20.299> yeah<00:03:21.299> it's

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the perfect game wave that is yeah it's

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.430 
the perfect game wave that is yeah it's
not<00:03:22.440> all<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.860> time<00:03:23.329> without<00:03:24.329> mass<00:03:24.780> moving<00:03:25.260> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
not all the time without mass moving I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.560 
not all the time without mass moving I
found<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.130> be<00:03:26.160> near<00:03:26.579> impossible<00:03:26.670> at<00:03:27.510> least

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
found it to be near impossible at least

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.050 
found it to be near impossible at least
in<00:03:27.930> Garry's<00:03:28.290> Mod<00:03:29.720> then<00:03:31.489> but<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.850> see<00:03:33.030> I

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
in Garry's Mod then but as you can see I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.420 
in Garry's Mod then but as you can see I
mean<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:33.450> quite<00:03:33.720> functional<00:03:34.019> it's<00:03:35.010> just

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
mean it's quite functional it's just

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.130 
mean it's quite functional it's just
again<00:03:35.940> I've<00:03:36.120> rarely<00:03:36.239> tried<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.720> forget<00:03:36.930> half

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
again I've rarely tried to forget half

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.160 
again I've rarely tried to forget half
neo<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:38.510> having<00:03:39.510> practice<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.019> could

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
neo so having practice you could

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.330 
neo so having practice you could
probably<00:03:41.040> pretty<00:03:41.430> good<00:03:43.070> yeah<00:03:44.070> that's<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
probably pretty good yeah that's the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.430 
probably pretty good yeah that's the
general<00:03:44.579> gist<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.480> haven't<00:03:46.200> programmed

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
general gist of it I haven't programmed

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.460 
general gist of it I haven't programmed
like<00:03:46.890> any<00:03:47.100> jump<00:03:47.519> or<00:03:47.850> reload<00:03:48.510> or<00:03:48.840> use<00:03:49.260> there

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
like any jump or reload or use there

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.850 
like any jump or reload or use there
anything<00:03:51.230> which<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.410> bit<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.680> an<00:03:52.739> issue

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
anything which is a bit of an issue

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.780 
anything which is a bit of an issue
because<00:03:53.160> with<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> steering<00:03:54.600> mode<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.350> can't

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
because with a steering mode you can't

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.340 
because with a steering mode you can't
switch<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.090> trigger<00:03:57.329> mode<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.079> can't

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
switch to the trigger mode so you can't

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.199 
switch to the trigger mode so you can't
use<00:03:58.470> them<00:03:58.590> both<00:03:58.680> at<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.860> same<00:03:58.920> time<00:03:59.220> they<00:04:00.090> have

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
use them both at the same time they have

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.180 
use them both at the same time they have
to<00:04:00.239> be<00:04:00.420> separate<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.200> you're<00:04:01.650> kind<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:01.860> limited

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
to be separate so you're kind of limited

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.340 
to be separate so you're kind of limited
to<00:04:02.220> what<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.459> can<00:04:02.519> do<00:04:02.820> like<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.900> angle

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
to what you can do like you can angle

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.830 
to what you can do like you can angle
your<00:04:04.410> your<00:04:04.799> palm<00:04:05.100> upwards<00:04:05.700> or<00:04:06.030> downwards<00:04:06.060> or

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
your your palm upwards or downwards or

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.539 
your your palm upwards or downwards or
sideways<00:04:07.260> as<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.560> said<00:04:07.709> before<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:11.370> can

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
sideways as I said before and you can

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.690 
sideways as I said before and you can
make<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.359> do<00:04:12.510> stuff<00:04:12.720> as<00:04:12.840> well<00:04:12.989> but<00:04:13.549> yeah<00:04:14.549> it's

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
make that do stuff as well but yeah it's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.330 
make that do stuff as well but yeah it's
fairly<00:04:14.880> limiting<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.780> sense<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:17.100> it

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
fairly limiting in that sense so it

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.800 
fairly limiting in that sense so it
would<00:04:17.430> be<00:04:17.549> nice<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.760> see<00:04:18.090> some<00:04:18.419> sort<00:04:18.660> of

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
would be nice to see some sort of

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.249 
would be nice to see some sort of
integration<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.709> two

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.390 

like<00:04:23.259> I<00:04:23.380> don't<00:04:23.560> know<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.919> move<00:04:24.069> your<00:04:24.220> hand

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
like I don't know if you move your hand

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.770 
like I don't know if you move your hand
a<00:04:24.490> bit<00:04:24.639> faster<00:04:25.030> they'll<00:04:25.180> go<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.539> trigger

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
a bit faster they'll go to the trigger

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.480 
a bit faster they'll go to the trigger
mode<00:04:25.900> or<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.169> kind<00:04:26.319> of<00:04:26.410> thing<00:04:26.530> there<00:04:27.400> could

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
mode or that kind of thing there could

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.850 
mode or that kind of thing there could
be<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.669> way<00:04:27.789> to<00:04:27.819> do<00:04:28.030> that<00:04:28.180> but<00:04:28.509> I<00:04:28.870> haven't

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
be a way to do that but I haven't

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.499 
be a way to do that but I haven't
counted<00:04:30.069> yet<00:04:30.310> as<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.669> said<00:04:30.849> I<00:04:31.060> haven't<00:04:31.330> played
