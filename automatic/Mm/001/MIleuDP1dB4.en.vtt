 and well, giving here in a world that 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.960
 we have also created with the right to 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.730
 what is the best of hunger who 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.990
 exists 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.480
 we often meet 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.560

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.560

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.260

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.260
 composing of base stone the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.220
 the limits and we have taken a bit of 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.869
 Meadow 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.799

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.799

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.619

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.470
 cages and we'll start running to see 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.470
 watch 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.310
 there are still missing these list failures 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.040
 they are all communicated but they are missing 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.210
 these highlights that we have also 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.200
 put to use here 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.200
 voucher voucher 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.650
 Y 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.870
 and let's go to sleep 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:31.030
 we have taken prairie to fight here and 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.909
 we have put two chests too 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.150
 distributed in the east and also take a 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:41.489
 piece of jungle for 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.540
 to blows like this hidden but there are many 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.140
 things that the blocks 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.740
 good a few the prairie also 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.290
 there are a few 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.980
 so far he has not caught me much either 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.349
 it was not very big 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.549
 and well, we are going to have a rule that 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:03.480
 will be whoever is the one who skips the 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:06.629
 is heading to some block as I can 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.250
 be disqualified from having to 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.410
 survive with what you see in the chests 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.430
 and well you can break leaves but not 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.140
 grass and that you know 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.859
 the grass gives you does not give you anything if you break 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.340
 grass left they give you repeated for 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.239
 hit with a seed, but already 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:37.260
 you can better break grass one and 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.260
 crosses the limit to land and land 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.680
 well out there there's a chain where 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.870
 we slept 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.299
 well we come now then the games of the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.390
 hungry 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.350
 we started in the morning breaking the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.240
 chests and 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.240
 and nothing that is known to sleep 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.140
 to the top 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:09.770
 and to the relief that there was of itself 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.770

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.390

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.590

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.919
 bed if you think that's how you're going to sleep 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.740
