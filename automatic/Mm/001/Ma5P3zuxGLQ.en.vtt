00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.320
 in this video we will solve the equation 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.150
 exponential that appears on screen 5 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.380
 high x equal to 3 high ax + 2 what 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.280
 which is usually done with an equation 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.609
 exponential is to decompose the bases in 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.999
 prime factors and somehow what 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.429
 ideal is that we get an equality in 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.259
 which in both parts of equality 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.230
 appear powers of the same base 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.039
 but let's notice that it decomposes moss 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:38.019
 both in 5 and 3 as they are already cousins ​​we 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.550
 is 5 and 3 so from here with the 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.190
 decomposition into prime factors that in 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.840
 this case is trivial is 5 equal to 53 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.760
 equal to 3 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 equalize get an equality 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.530
 with powers from the same base is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.420
 impossible 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.670
 then how is this equation solved 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.700
 is for the entity 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.380
 we are going to help from the calculator 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.270
 at the time when they did not exist 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.070
 calculators we would have to 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.710
 use logarithmic tables 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's go there let's do is put in 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.510
 both sides of equality a logarithm 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 we can put the logarithm in the base 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.190
 we want our case I'm going to put 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 Neperian logarithm can be put 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.760
 logarithm based on 10 or logarithm no 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.800
 another man base is advisable to put 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.170
 a logarithm that the calculator comes out 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.370
 automatically to not work more than 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.720
 bill 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.600
 I put the neperian logarithm but 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.090
 you can not do with organisms 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.720
 more than 10 neperian logarithm of 5 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.979
 high x equal to neperian logarithm of 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.370
 3 of each x + 2 or if we want here a 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.530
 parenthesis in parentheses 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.930
 clear how these two things are the same 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.050
 the logarithm gives more things also have 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.250
 that match the properties of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.890
 logarithms 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.159
 it serves for any particular part 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.700
 for the base number for the home no longer 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.179
 we will play neperiano's has raised a 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 exponent x let's put if you want n 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.610
 this is in the exponent can come out 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.349
 out of logarithm we explain this 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.349
 in both parts of equality we have 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.620
 neperian logarithm of 5 raised ax the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.080
 x passes forward x would be equal to x by 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.390
 neperian logarithm of 5 I mean the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.489
 x passes forward and the same in this 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.860
 second member of equality then 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.519
 none Neperian of 3 that goes from x + 2 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.550
 the x + 2 passes forward now logarithm 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.300
 Neperian of 3 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.850
 perfect that we have this I'm going to 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.010
 keep the Neperian organism until the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.610
 final and then at the end the cream a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.020
 calculator and even if one does not leave 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.180
 indicated the organism because in that case 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.310
 does not have in its case not dispose the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.310
 calculator or does not want to work 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.770
 with approximate values ​​because it is left in 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.300
 that moment I will warn you here 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.300
 x neperian logarithm of 5 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.970
 same 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.129
 x + 2 per neperian logarithm of 3 per 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.580
 the distributive property would be x 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:14.299
 Neperian logarithm of three plus two 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.299
 logarithm 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.430
 let's note that both are adding as 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.230
 this summing have x I'm going to put the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.989
 same part I keep the 2 logarithm 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.030
 Neperian of 3 on the right side where 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.590
 we just passed this on the other hand 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.650
 subtracting x neperian logarithm from 5 x 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.750
 neperian logarithm of 3 would equal 2 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.060
 Neperian logarithm of 3 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.910
 in this first member of equality what 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.040
 What we do is take out common factor of xx 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.280
 by neperian logarithm 5 less 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.620
 neperian logarithm of 3 equal to 2 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.930
 Neperian logarithm of 3 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.129
 we just have to pass this on 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.409
 It is a number, although a good number is 256 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.450
 it's a subtraction of logarithms but it's a 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.069
 number then we passed it dividing the 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.069
 another part with what we already have 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.810
 cleared x that would be equal to 2 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.450
 Neperian logarithm of three parties 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.940
 neperian logarithm 5 minus logarithm 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.890
 neperiano 3 that we do not want to work with 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.190
 approximate numbers we do not have 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.109
 calculator result yes yes we want 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.910
 work with decimal numbers then 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.740
 we take the calculator and calculate this 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.770
 what we have here 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.979
 2 neperian logarithm of 3 for 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:35.550
 round 4 figures 3 moods 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.550
 Neperian remains 10 986 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.500
 match of the neperian logarithm of 5 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.500
 1.60 94 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.470
 - a Neperian organism of three that is 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.020
 10 986 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.740
 and this is what we have left 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:04.380
 the 2 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:08.310
 for 10 986 equal to 2.19 72 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:18.510
 to the bottom 1.60 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:20.560
 94 - 10 986 equal to 0.50 and 10 8 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:30.540
 we do the division 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:34.870
 2 1972 divided by 0.5 108 equal to 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:41.740
 4.30 15 rounding 4 figures because I 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:45.240
 it comes out 24 30 14 8 we round like 48 x 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.960
 we put 54 30 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.599
 I repeat 148 how I do not do and whatever 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.849
 as rounding to the fourth figure and this 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.669
 number is greater than 5 then what 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:00.660
 I do is instead of putting a 4 like 48 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:04.520
 more cep is closer to 50 740 then 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.520
 here round the fourth 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.900
 therefore the approximate result I return 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.720
 to repeat to four figures by rounding 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.720
 it would be 4 30 15
