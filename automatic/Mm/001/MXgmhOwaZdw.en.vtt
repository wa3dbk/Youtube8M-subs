top left corner of the first area I'm

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.450 
top left corner of the first area I'm
here<00:01:55.259> you're<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> move<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.920> boulder<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
here you're going to move a boulder that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.609 
here you're going to move a boulder that
is<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.290> southwest<00:01:58.290> corner<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:59.310> next<00:01:59.340> area

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.960 

maybe<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.890> another<00:02:05.100> repel<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
maybe get another repel if you get that

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.150 
maybe get another repel if you get that
father<00:02:06.409> house<00:02:07.409> they're<00:02:07.619> completely<00:02:07.890> optional

father house they're completely optional
I<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.819> find<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.360> they're<00:02:09.660> easier<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.200> work

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
I just find that they're easier to work

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:24.460 
I just find that they're easier to work
with

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
then a little bolder pass right there

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.810 
then a little bolder pass right there
that<00:02:33.870> blocked-off<00:02:34.200> thing<00:02:34.650> once<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.580> clear

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that then you exit and get out of this

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.860 
that then you exit and get out of this
place<00:02:38.280> but<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> little<00:02:39.600> complicated<00:02:39.930> so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
place but it's a little complicated so

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.360 
place but it's a little complicated so
instead<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.930> walking<00:02:43.140> up<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.590> place<00:02:43.830> seems

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
instead of walking up that place seems

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.490 
instead of walking up that place seems
nice<00:02:44.490> actually<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> move<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.110> Boulder

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
nice actually going to move that Boulder

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.070 
nice actually going to move that Boulder
that<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.980> right<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.460> middle<00:02:47.670> there<00:02:48.120> we're

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that is right in the middle there we're

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.550 
that is right in the middle there we're
going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> move<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.760> basically<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
going to move it to basically the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.370 
going to move it to basically the
northwest<00:02:52.560> corner<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:54.000> third<00:02:54.360> area<00:02:54.630> which

northwest corner of the third area which

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.100 
northwest corner of the third area which
are<00:02:55.530> now<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> little<00:02:57.720> annoying<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.959> get

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
are now in it's a little annoying to get

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.870 
are now in it's a little annoying to get
it<00:02:58.200> around<00:02:58.290> there<00:02:58.650> because<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.160> good<00:02:59.820> a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
it around there because it's so good a

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.380 
it around there because it's so good a
bit<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.150> distance<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.630> cover<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.850> no<00:03:02.850> issues

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
bit of distance to cover but no issues

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:26.330 
bit of distance to cover but no issues
besides<00:03:03.660> that

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.570 

easy<00:03:26.880> enough<00:03:27.630> okay<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.099> you<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.280> go<00:03:29.400> down

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
easy enough okay so now you can go down

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.510 
easy enough okay so now you can go down
that<00:03:29.760> little<00:03:30.000> tunnel<00:03:30.360> right<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
that little tunnel right there you the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.559 
that little tunnel right there you the
strength<00:03:32.790> again<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:39.150> you're<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.450> to

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
strength again and then you're going to

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.820 
strength again and then you're going to
work<00:03:39.750> back<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.230> where<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.470> were<00:03:40.590> before

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.309 

except<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:43.920> time<00:03:44.459> one<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.480> passages<00:03:45.930> is

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
except this time one of the passages is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.370 
except this time one of the passages is
going<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.709> there<00:03:47.840> okay<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:48.989> now<00:03:49.230> we're

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
going to be there okay so now we're

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.690 
going to be there okay so now we're
going<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.560> try<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.769> work<00:03:49.950> on<00:03:50.160> getting<00:03:50.430> that

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
going to try to work on getting that

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.960 
going to try to work on getting that
last<00:03:51.110> blocking<00:03:56.330> look<00:03:57.330> how<00:03:57.480> created<00:03:57.989> but<00:03:58.970> it's

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
last blocking look how created but it's

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.420 
last blocking look how created but it's
worth<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:03.319> there<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.500> up<00:04:04.650> this<00:04:04.830> passes<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
worth it there you up this passes the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.229 
worth it there you up this passes the
throne<00:04:06.319> go<00:04:07.319> pass<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.010> paper<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.850> would<00:04:09.030> be
