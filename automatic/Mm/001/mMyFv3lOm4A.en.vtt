Bowflex<00:01:26.080> here<00:01:26.380> for<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:27.070> know<00:01:27.160> 20<00:01:27.580> 30<00:01:27.820> seconds

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
Bowflex here for you know 20 30 seconds

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:56.950 
Bowflex here for you know 20 30 seconds
or<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:31.200> okay<00:01:32.200> here<00:01:32.380> goes<00:01:32.470> nothing

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.300 

that<00:01:57.960> wasn't<00:01:58.200> starting<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.770> much<00:01:58.920> better<00:01:59.159> than

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that wasn't starting to much better than

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.899 
that wasn't starting to much better than
this<00:01:59.870> when<00:02:00.870> I<00:02:00.900> bought<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
this when I bought it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
this when I bought it
most<00:02:03.690> likely<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> combination<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:05.130> just

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
most likely it's a combination of just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.180 
most likely it's a combination of just
having<00:02:05.520> sad<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.330> old<00:02:07.229> fuel<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.770> there<00:02:07.950> but

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
having sad and old fuel in there but

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
hopefully if I give this a few more

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.430 
hopefully if I give this a few more
