00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.220
 We used electronic drums using the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 usb3 computer keyboard integrated lm 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.640
 324 here on this ldr tip and on that other 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.510
 Which leds tip as I always 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.309
 works works the simple way 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:41.520
 show you the circuit diagram 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.850
 here is the floor here an amplifier 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:51.660
 2 resistors and one LED of the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 imi rate 324 integrated costing 50 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.399
 cents in any component store 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 electronics 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.489
 remembering that the scheme that I showed 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.710
 Are you going to ride for each of these? 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.510
 operating applicators what's inside 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.500
 of cast 324 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.119
 as it has four skins gives to 4 people 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.930
 will do a zany fast simulation 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 here with the cast 324 for only 1 asks 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.009
 for you to have a sense of how the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:31.799
 use protocol where the integrated it in 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:34.009
 324 2 resistors of 47 here made games 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:41.549
 wired network cables 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:42.649
 the ldr and led and a cable cap of 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.840
 network 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.759
 this one here is a usb keyboard board 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.869
 I took it from inside a keyboard I disassembled 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.200
 I took two strands of two parents and children and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.020
 if I eat here I'll call in the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 two wires coming from usb port question 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.000
 connected to the keyboard board 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.280
 the black red wire with the power 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.220
 USB port offers 5 volts then the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 people enjoy 5 volts coming to 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.319
 avoid them 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.680
 another thing the battery eliminator 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.680
 things 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.300
 the other two wires this white this 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.750
 orange buttons are the key contacts that 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.709
 It's already a joke of digital drums. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.610
 the dish is that of the dali rate in 1324 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:39.319
 for you and will guide you in the hour of 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:45.590
 you do not miss the schematic of the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:47.450
 very simple circuit what we do 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.560
 I'll call the contacts here first. 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.630
 the keyboard 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.269
 reminding me to close contacts here 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.190
 he type is letter r 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:00.440
 I'll call the first one integrated into 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:04.030
 1324 pin 4 goes in positive connect to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.350
 first feed of it bound positive 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.769
 down and now I'm going to land that's the 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.769
 11 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.890
 I'm going to put the first resistor that stays 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.530
 in the foot between terminal 1 and 2 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:28.100
 according to the scheme I just 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:31.930
 show now I'll dial the 2 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.930
 stay on floor 3 and go ashore 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.620
 Now I'm going to put the net cap 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.280
 it is not of r that prevents them from 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.140
 the external brightness is the ldl and 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.310
 he is typing the letter r 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.140
 it messes you put the led and it fits 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.900
 it in the network cable cap so that 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.420
 let it stay in and straight positioned 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.750
 and is right in front of the uerj br 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.810
 at the terminals of the lr you connect the wires 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.900
 which comes with keystroking key and the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.049
 led is positioned in front or ldn 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:14.450
 when doctors and beat it on weight 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:16.340
 the led flashes and illuminates ldl and ldl 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.060
 decreases resistance and it closes the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.590
 contact you can also 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.270
 use a joystick 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.710
 There are a lot of people using today. 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.349
 computer of the sb to use it in 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.569
 digital world can also be used 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.250
 simply connect the wires to the button contact 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.379
 joystick 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.569
 So nobody's feeding here anymore. 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:40.159
 usb keypad that will serve to 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.210
 food or integrated 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:48.620
 I already turned on the weight, the weight stays on 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:51.560
 land and does not have the integrated floor and 2 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.560
 I think an integrated dodo goes to 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.169
 led when the weight of the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.580
 suffered a twist in itself is not 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.580
 amplified by professional fisherman 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.850
 the album 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.130
 ae
