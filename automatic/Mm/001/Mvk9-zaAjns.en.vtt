00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:08.929
 Hello dear viewer 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.500
 of this video and now I'll tell you how 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:19.039
 troubleshoot perry heating 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:25.769
 their smartbook or netbook asus eee pc 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:30.529
 1201n immediately tell you about his system 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.880
 he has a dual-core intel atom processor 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:40.050
 so now the focus is barely there 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:46.770
 2-core + nvidia ion video card 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:50.640
 any there force 9 400 m in my 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.280
 it seems like such a system should allocate 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 a lot of heat 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.379
 about the processor would not say but here 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.379
 the card itself to the will of the same bitterness 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.210
 Now we have already upgraded the system 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.409
 I can tell 12 percent is 1 core 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.130
 18 percent people second core 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.969
 processor 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.020
 before I upgraded the system there 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:27.700
 there were indicators 40 50 degrees 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.450
 sometimes up to 75 so it came 38 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.640
 degrees is our graphics chip it 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:41.310
 us was the hottest he was constantly 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.170
 up to 60 smith to 70 degrees 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.720
 the state is simple that is, rock was even 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.240
 not loaded 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.780
 what did I notice that our idol he 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.479
 spinning at minimum speed and even 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.799
 didn't want to be normal like that 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.799
 what did we do 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.440
 you will be fucking 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:23.430
 our system is possession of 4 finals 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.430
 or different wires wires 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:35.040
 this is without a black wire we have 5 minutes 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.680
 also we have a yellow wire which 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:45.790
 It counts the number of revolutions of a second and 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:50.760
 we have a blue wire here which we have 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:54.490
 regulate the bark of our culinary 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.830
 shooting can see 4 a lot of it to you 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.010
 certainly not needed if you don't want 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.720
 delve into the details and how to me 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.260
 decided to single out our two 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.600
 occasion and insulate them so they don't 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.580
 in contact with each other and 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.580
 did not contact our fee 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.460
 in the usual scotch tent detached there 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.640
 from the whole system 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:30.310
 I will say there is one minus on the scale 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 dogs at maximum speed I do not know 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.640
 listen to that 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.150
 but I will say he is so squeaky and so 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.530
 the sound of such a breeze 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.799
 it is not much screaming so it is quite 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.849
 normally considering that without this we 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.680
 just our netbook just he 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:58.049
 overheated and cut down at any 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:04.389
 load and now it is under load 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:08.069
 warms up to 45 degrees in general 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:13.239
 how to disassemble it you can see 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:18.400
 a bunch of videos a bunch of pictures with this is like 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:23.289
 you collect then think so figure out 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.039
 I told you the idea I can still tell you 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:30.610
 that will help you replace the dried 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:34.710
 thermal paste but for this you need to unleash 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.320
 bolts get the motherboard 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:42.539
 flip unscrew the failure cube 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.210
 unscrew the bolts from the processor and video chip 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.440
 remove the cooling then remove the old 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.130
 thermal grease 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.190
 pour new if it is if not then 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.669
 it is better not to wash the old one 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:01.650
 until you find a new one so in principle 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:05.500
 and without replacing the thermal paste, I cooled it 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.050
 literally twice and I think it is 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.680
 good result thanks to all who 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.500
 I watched this video I will say right away 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.639
 approach is suitable for each laptop 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.620
 netbook 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.060
 computer knives if he has a cooler 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.050
 works on 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.550
 Well, the average minimum speed and 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.550
 terribly overheats he source
