let your herbs dried pretty much until

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.520 
let your herbs dried pretty much until

you put them in the oven it's not
working<00:02:39.980> very<00:02:40.010> well<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.819> let<00:02:41.420> them<00:02:41.540> dry

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
working very well and let them dry

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.630 
working very well and let them dry
pretty<00:02:42.170> well<00:02:42.410> these<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:43.069> seem<00:02:43.250> really

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
pretty well these just seem really

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.210 
pretty well these just seem really
rubbery<00:02:43.910> wet<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.660> morning<00:02:44.720> yet<00:02:45.440> I'm<00:02:46.010> going

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
rubbery wet this morning yet I'm going

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.610 
rubbery wet this morning yet I'm going
to<00:02:46.280> let<00:02:46.459> them<00:02:46.550> dry<00:02:46.819> as<00:02:47.420> long<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.020> takes<00:02:48.290> and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
to let them dry as long as it takes and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.820 
to let them dry as long as it takes and
then<00:02:49.430> put<00:02:49.880> them<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.150> oven<00:02:50.420> I'm<00:02:51.140> no<00:02:51.410> pro<00:02:51.650> at

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
then put them in the oven I'm no pro at

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.100 
then put them in the oven I'm no pro at
this<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.370> used<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.820> just<00:02:52.970> hang<00:02:53.300> dry<00:02:53.690> them<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.080> I

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
this I used to just hang dry them but I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.020 
this I used to just hang dry them but I
thought<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.500> would<00:02:54.680> speed<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.430> process

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
thought this would speed up the process

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.470 
thought this would speed up the process
and<00:02:56.860> normally<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.010> worked<00:02:58.730> really<00:02:58.970> well<00:02:59.090> last

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
and normally it worked really well last

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.449 
and normally it worked really well last
time<00:02:59.750> but<00:02:59.930> I<00:02:59.989> think<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.290> let<00:03:00.440> my<00:03:00.560> herbs<00:03:00.769> sit<00:03:01.190> a

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
time but I think I let my herbs sit a

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.030 
time but I think I let my herbs sit a
lot<00:03:02.300> longer<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.230> little<00:03:03.470> damper<00:03:03.890> in

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
lot longer and it's a little damper in

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.190 
lot longer and it's a little damper in
the<00:03:04.130> house<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.180> things<00:03:05.450> aren't<00:03:05.630> drying<00:03:05.959> as

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
the house so things aren't drying as

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.240 
the house so things aren't drying as
well<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.739> let<00:03:06.980> your<00:03:07.160> herbs<00:03:07.340> set<00:03:08.180> up<00:03:09.069> and<00:03:10.069> get

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
well so let your herbs set up and get

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.949 
well so let your herbs set up and get
themselves<00:03:10.489> dried<00:03:11.090> out<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.269> little<00:03:11.540> bit<00:03:11.780> before

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
themselves dried out a little bit before

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.640 
themselves dried out a little bit before
you<00:03:12.319> stick<00:03:12.739> them<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.130> oven<00:03:14.260> okay<00:03:15.260> here's

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
you stick them in the oven okay here's

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.490 
you stick them in the oven okay here's
my<00:03:15.860> original<00:03:16.130> all<00:03:16.670> dried<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.930> crispy<00:03:18.319> works

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
out pretty well you just kind of have to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.080 
out pretty well you just kind of have to
be<00:03:21.380> careful<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.570> don't<00:03:24.790> don't<00:03:25.790> leave

your unattended so on with the rest

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.270 
your unattended so on with the rest
later<00:03:29.420> as<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> dry<00:03:30.440> here<00:03:30.799> in<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.070> house<00:03:31.250> a

later as a dry here in the house a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.759 
later as a dry here in the house a
little<00:03:31.610> longer<00:03:32.170> they're<00:03:33.170> kind<00:03:33.410> of<00:03:33.440> rubbery

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
and dry them which would work pretty

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.560 
and dry them which would work pretty
well<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:07.009> actually<00:05:07.880> just<00:05:08.060> letting<00:05:08.300> them<00:05:08.360> sit

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570
