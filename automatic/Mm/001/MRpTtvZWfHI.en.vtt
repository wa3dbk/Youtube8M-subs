00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.490
 set 76 014 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.960
 and quickly tell you what I mean about him 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.960
 I think 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.910
 we 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.110
 and so what we get in this set 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:16.829
 get the spider maine at 33 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.500
 on trike and electro why did i buy this 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.479
 set first because I 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 fond of yaga spiderman collecting everything 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.920
 figurines especially all kinds of villains 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 other characters from the animated series to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.509
 sorry he is done about 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.649
 we are a team mate spiderman they 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.920
 classic 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.340
 very sad and because of this many 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.740
 many 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.709
 slides and not quite similar to their 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.270
 classic prototypes and here is this set 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:46.590
 particular was stupid perfezza 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.200
 electro besides him here is spiderman on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.270
 this very Thai and all and nothing more 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.189
 it first saw the store bought 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.590
 thought but an inexpensive set down just 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.450
 There is a bit of extra money bought this 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.349
 I think I will be electro then I bought 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.509
 i think damn i already have three 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:09.569
 spider-man 3 4 I especially do not need here 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.840
 I don't really need this either. 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.430
 same obvious to the game for an audience of 5 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.170
 up to 12 years created these gur the way I could 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.940
 buy separately especially since I 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.019
 I use we have Britlin what was so 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.930
 bother 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.359
 I did not understand so I bit even on housing 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.000
 but I will tell you about the set 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.890
 the figurine is the same absolutely somehow their 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.470
 last 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.660
 here 2 probably already nothing new there is no bike 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.160
 which allows the spiderman to attack 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.770
 on electro double force and the figure itself 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.370
 electro which is pretty cool can 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.950
 probably again on the pieces you probably 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.900
 in the Lord firmly in general will not 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.000
 quite interesting head and hands they 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.239
 transparent not often meet in the summer 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.920
 transparency figures he stole some 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.340
 diamond is such a small set 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.060
 If you do not have the figures of the spider-man 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.790
 and you want to start collecting something 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.440
 by marvel or 5 spider man it 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.840
 great set super profitable 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.720
 offer 200 slides which are 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.160
 Separately probably worth a half times 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.260
 more than this whole set 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
 but for me personally it was probably 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
 hasty she 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.950
 and I will look towards the big 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.459
 set there is mary jane where there 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.910
 goblin is a huge version of cartoons and 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.040
 comics and go wash spiderman or what 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.070
 where do they have for themselves the universe unfamiliar 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.750
 I do not know why he is such a huge goblin 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.140
 wrong there everything but 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.690
 I still like the set manually 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.440
 Spidey and marvel in general, all up to the new 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.480
 Meet up to new brik forms wait and Tim 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.620
 the main channel will soon be many 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.630
 interesting set hi everyone when i 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.820
 reduced the live channel I pursued two goals 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.560
 first get the opportunity 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.209
 upload random rollers here 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.730
 some and blogs 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.920
 and secondly communicate with you at such and such 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.620
 here's an informal such setting in 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.140
 divorced from the framework which I myself 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.140
 put the programs on the main channel 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.440
