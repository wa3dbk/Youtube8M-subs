time you click on it it adds another
book<00:01:15.219> as<00:01:15.640> well<00:01:15.670> what<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.509> did<00:01:16.750> here<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.079> I<00:01:17.170> put<00:01:17.439> in

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
book as well what I did here is I put in

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.249 
book as well what I did here is I put in
something<00:01:18.250> in<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.670> keep<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.240> there<00:01:19.450> but<00:01:20.079> that

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
something in it keep it there but that

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.169 
something in it keep it there but that
doesn't<00:01:20.590> always<00:01:20.709> work<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.249> it's<00:01:21.700> sometimes

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
doesn't always work and it's sometimes

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.090 
doesn't always work and it's sometimes
fades<00:01:22.539> out<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.959> best<00:01:23.140> way<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.409> do<00:01:23.619> this<00:01:23.649> by<00:01:24.039> the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
fades out the best way to do this by the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.199 
fades out the best way to do this by the
way<00:01:24.219> is<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:25.569> have<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.319> competitor<00:01:26.979> so<00:01:27.969> you<00:01:28.060> can

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
way is to have a competitor so you can

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.949 
way is to have a competitor so you can
load<00:01:28.450> them<00:01:28.689> up<00:01:28.750> with<00:01:28.929> them<00:01:29.259> two<00:01:30.929> again<00:01:31.929> I've

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
load them up with them two again I've

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.559 
load them up with them two again I've
never<00:01:32.409> got<00:01:32.679> this<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.189> work<00:01:33.640> for<00:01:34.450> very<00:01:34.630> long

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
never got this to work for very long

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.839 
never got this to work for very long
usually<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.689> skeletons<00:01:38.289> will<00:01:38.849> disappear

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
usually the skeletons will disappear

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.069 
usually the skeletons will disappear
after<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.179> while<00:01:40.360> then<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.200> go<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.379> solitude

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
after a while then you go to solitude

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.589

is<00:03:48.560> worth<00:03:48.590> one<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.340> takes<00:03:49.580> a<00:03:49.730> little<00:03:49.850> while

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060
