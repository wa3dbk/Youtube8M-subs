00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.100
 cooked 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.339
 which is called visual cuisine 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.569
 which offers you different cooking recipes 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.869
 these disputes between 700 proposing four categories the meats the 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.119
 fish but I have nothing and desserts 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.119
 in each category the words to make them parade and what society 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.890
 weiner we have about ten 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.330
 about a dozen recipes for ocha which was the criterion it's 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.010
 a recipe 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.640
 it looks like this on a long page we will scroll 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 until the final photo 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.030
 a snack 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 there is one to one the different ingredients the number of marks is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.550
 excellent ground 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.880
 a small interesting side of a point on foot on every after ten years 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.010
 and we will see 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.550
 different information about the value for him the different weapons the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.110
 different names story with this art 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.500
 so that's interesting other element 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.269
 here we have the opportunity to send the recipe 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.160
 5 is a little more ump which is still pretty cool it should be noted 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.550
 we did not know if the search engine 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.880
 for example if I want to say if I want a recipe 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.810
 with carrots 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.600
 press 40 and we have the three three recipes that appear we go in 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.570
 look for a 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.120
 ap and we have the 40 and always the possibility of course to support 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 on each plane to see more information 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.470
 we will come back on 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.470
 recipes it's a hymn 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.360
 the app obviously parent walks in portrait or landscape 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.180

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.040

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.720
