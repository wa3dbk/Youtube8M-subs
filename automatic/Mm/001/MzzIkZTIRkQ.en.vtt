00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello there is no vilsack itself 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.330
 how can a helicopter simulator 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.220
 seem at first sight it 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.869
 long-awaited for many game tricks and 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.420
 drive which only visited and appstore 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.940
 and now available there for 229 rubles either 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.230
 7 dollars in general is exclusive to 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.690
 similar games on mobile platforms 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.850
 great variety ranging from arcade 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.500
 bridge vantand and asphalt 8 and ending 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.989
 something more serious like real racing 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.909
 3 per origins ventured release 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.440
 your game under the brand drive with such 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.909
 With the promise of type check it out guys 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.100
 real men racing simulators 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.749
 do with a huge amount of real 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.519
 cars of track modes and all that 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:50.199
 Other night we'll see what they have 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.199
 turned out actually drove 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.739
 Apple discounts to all subscribers from 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.660
 partner and store apple just.ru 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.280
 but in fact it turned out a complete garbage I 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.710
 to be honest I donâ€™t even know how with such 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.200
 water could make such a game by 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 she's pretty mediocre but not 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100
 is no match for real racing 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.009
 3 already see it by textures 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.880
 although it seems to be some such 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.619
 photorealism achieved 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.630
 backgrounds are very perky I really 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.030
 liked sky sun right over well here 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.040
 Well done, but as far as textures are 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.659
 be give shame to release today is 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.670
 on iphone 5 it is clear that 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.590
 krivorukost developers rolls 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.390
 apparently therefore they began to make a version 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.009
 only come up because with android and 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.350
 its fragmentation there they would just 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.720
 sticking to the end but in general it turned out 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.759
 somehow that's not vigorous sadly understandable 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
 what they wanted to do on hardcore serious 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.690
 such a stimulant to all straight 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.130
 questions did not get up who is the folder here but 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.020
 business 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.390
 department and issues a lot to play at all 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.550
 absolutely not interesting to me and somehow here 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.649
 I even for how to explain it but look 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.740
 so you understand it here for example real 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.740
 racing 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.490
 and this is the fat drive 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.370
 while water louder good 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 really a large number of modes 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.830
 There is generally cool type of race on 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.380
 salt lake eat and dodge 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.840
 helicopter for a while and so on so 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.120
 further so on but in fact physics is all 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.400
 kills because you don't feel at all 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.190
 have you driving any machine and 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.170
 kind of like a lot of all kinds of trinkets 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.240
 but when not this again the basics 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.460
 the main thing is this one choir shouting 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.370
 on in this case it is not clear to her 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.440
 it could be that there is no such play 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.630
 no fun especially since 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.430
 really leaves and lively real racing 3 yes 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.560
 he has there not very adequate to my 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.840
 look the system donato but nonetheless 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.720
 is played then everything is good here despite 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.580
 the fact that the game costs 229 rubles there are two 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
 type of currency but everything is very much like in ordinary 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.080
 premium and fast enough you will understand 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.870
 that without investing real stress further 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.270
 it's just impossible to move and this 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.630
 personally, I was very bothered by all this 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.630
 time 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.270
 So it turns out that there are cars 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.210
 everything is drawn well even some 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.310
 data and for fans probably I am so 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.770
 I will say this game will be very very topic 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.800
 for those who like cars like to look at 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.970
 beautiful or not very painted body 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.220
 and drives 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.260
 in the pit moat with all sorts of upgrades 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.920
 and drive through real cities this is in 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.290
 this sense 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.850
 and competitive advantages drive chains 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.190
 on from real racing 3 i'm not very 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.800
 I love when you drive around the city 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.900
 she is somehow prettier here but 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.430
 In general, nothing more to tell me 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.709
 the only wild fun 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.660
 upgrade system of your machine you are not 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.480
 can do anything with his engine 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.700
 transmissions and other nodes place that 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.010
 you can entertain yourself by painting 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.230
 changing tinted glass 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.700
 but also just mine and generally hit on 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.470
 in fact, what struck me right up 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.530
 the depths of the soul is an opportunity already in 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.730
 four places to hang all kinds of 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.620
 stinkers and other stuff 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.840
 I do not know who came up with it at all bits 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.810
 mobile games but still such 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.590
 Here is a very strange version of such a drive 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.630
 which is 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.580
 but you have to be a very big fan to 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.780
 Here in this all play himself was vilsakom 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.040
 subscribe to the channel join our 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.780
 VKontakte groups subscribe to my 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.370
 twitter and soon I'll see you then 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.930
 asking why there will be no joke 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.419
 because I can't play this 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.980
 the game is something that I do not like it like 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.550
 there is no very simple logic 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.550
 until
