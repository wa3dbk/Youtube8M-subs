00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
when I watch it the first time it did

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.650 
when I watch it the first time it did
seem<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:48.430> some<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.910> way<00:02:49.060> still<00:02:49.360> out<00:02:49.510> of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
seem like some of the way still out of

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.330 
seem like some of the way still out of
it<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.260> when<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.470> watch<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> next<00:02:50.950> time<00:02:51.220> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
it so when I watch it the next time I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.250 
it so when I watch it the next time I
made<00:02:51.640> sure<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:52.090> like<00:02:52.239> kind<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.600> scrunch<00:02:52.959> it

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
made sure to like kind of scrunch it

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.259 
made sure to like kind of scrunch it
kind<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.799> scrunch<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.340> way<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:54.549> they<00:02:54.940> will<00:02:55.120> be

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
kind of scrunch the way so they will be

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.330 
kind of scrunch the way so they will be
more<00:02:55.450> pronounced<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.200> when<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> did<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.890> they

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
more pronounced and when I did that they

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.699 
more pronounced and when I did that they
came<00:02:57.610> back<00:02:57.880> some<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:58.810> as<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.410> see<00:02:59.560> the

came back some so as you can see the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.640 
came back some so as you can see the
closure<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:01.120> has<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:02.410> know<00:03:02.440> it

nothing<00:03:40.090> not<00:03:40.810> at<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.109> not<00:03:42.040> even<00:03:42.100> like<00:03:42.489> for

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
nothing not at all not even like for

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.240 
nothing not at all not even like for
like<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.450> run<00:03:44.170> through<00:03:44.410> my<00:03:44.530> hand<00:03:44.829> through<00:03:45.040> I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
like a run through my hand through I

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.160 
like a run through my hand through I
might<00:03:45.549> get<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.790> couple<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.209> snags<00:03:46.480> here<00:03:46.840> there

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
might get a couple of snags here there

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.830 
might get a couple of snags here there
but<00:03:47.620> other<00:03:47.859> than<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.160> when<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.090> wash<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.630> it

but other than that when you wash it it

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.840 
but other than that when you wash it it
doesn't<00:03:50.079> tangle<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:51.040> bomb<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.489> doesn't

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
doesn't tangle it's the bomb it doesn't

anyone who wanted to buy it I did not

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.979 
anyone who wanted to buy it I did not
die<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.010> came<00:04:00.640> very<00:04:00.670> very<00:04:01.000> dark<00:04:01.390> pretty<00:04:01.900> much

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
die it came very very dark pretty much

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.140 
die it came very very dark pretty much
black<00:04:02.410> already<00:04:02.859> so<00:04:03.430> i<00:04:03.459> didn't<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.850> dye

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
black already so i didn't have to dye

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150 
black already so i didn't have to dye
the<00:04:04.209> hair<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.109> I'm<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.650> don't<00:04:05.889> plan<00:04:06.100> on

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
the hair so I'm and I don't plan on

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.830 
the hair so I'm and I don't plan on
doing<00:04:06.519> anything<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.269> think<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.720> is

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
doing anything to it I think this is

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.750

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.440 
think I'm going to get another closure
maybe<00:04:11.739> like<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.310> body<00:04:12.609> wave<00:04:12.819> closure<00:04:13.180> because

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
maybe like a body wave closure because

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.000 
maybe like a body wave closure because
