00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.740
 flo 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.279
 and yesterday the friends that's what awaits 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.450
 belgian how are you I hope you 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.119
 have very well so today we get 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.220
 found for a little soft test a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.390
 little bit unusual on family xi 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.250
 motors 15 with a lamborghini so I 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.949
 not used to present this kind of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.540
 car on fermi motors 15 finally his 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.150
 the cold farming in general that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 already shut down it's not a game that has 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.140
 especially a lot of cars that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.790
 you know it well but I had how 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 vis you wanted to introduce because I 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.270
 I said well it's a little bonus that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.530
 can be nice for those who love 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.149
 of course anyway what kind of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.719
 car oxides ibra why not you the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.910
 share 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.640
 it can be nice for you so here 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.379
 here you see well that our dear 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.270
 little car is really not bad 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.310
 made at least outside it is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.280
 pretty pretty now see well that at 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.160
 no plaque against the textures 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 here see well that the alveoli 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.009
 will leave and if they are well respected 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 lamborghini 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.690
 everything is well done at least it's 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 not saturate it's not pixelated it's 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.770
 really very well done i find 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.459
 nathan look a little bit in the front 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.170
 I think it's a little bit 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.940
 rough the grid so well saw 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.899
 also the gray tires I find that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.250
 it's a bit messy I would have 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.140
 preferred that tires be 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.000
 blacks etc. these are real tires but 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.319
 good it's just the little flaw 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.789
 exterior appearance 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.020
 so now we can see you here 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.280
 that when we go inside 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.840
 the interior is correct I want to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.130
 say in this type of car if it's 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.289
 ok we are not used to seeing 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.160
 interiors for cars so that 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.810
 remain quite we'll say basic 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.310
 but there is worse now is not 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.830
 not in a tractor so we can understand 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.800
 that the interior is not as good 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.869
 worked only in his tractor so I 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.520
 just let you listen to the noise 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.770
 2 when I get into the car 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.570
 listen carefully 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.740
 so the noise is pretty enough so is 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.620
 now we will just go a little 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.540
 little to Lille has tested you can see 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.010
 a few it stands some 83 to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.140
 the pity they did not grow 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.510
 until 120 it would have been good 120 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.670
 so frankly 100 or 120 are been 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.700
 pretty good and small coislin can 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.630
 attest to what I could do with this 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.630
 that I had the opportunity to test 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.200
 she can not do that that's enough 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.990
 Nice is when we see cars 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.700
 in farming elvis all the time and that 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.980
 it's a shame but while his target 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.250
 well I made a turn copse see 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.210
 well hop I recover and see well 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.830
 she does not 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.690
 here is sent a people 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.520
 it does not slip too much except 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.160
 when we make two turns , but 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.180
 it does not matter everything is enough 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.000
 nice you see well 83 per hour 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.859
 I think it does it well and that it 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.900
 it's nice you farming 1 see you 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.269
 well two positions works and 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.120
 needed four loops and that's good 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.069
 now tomorrow at valerie too but 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.140
 good it's not too serious 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.269
 it's that once again that options 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.069
 here 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.810
 voili voilou isaac so we will see them 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.069
 a little bit side rates how much 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.579
 costs anyway because it costs a 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.150
 cheap 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.040
 it costs 180 9000 euros 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.769
 so she does that turn horses that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.200
 it's interesting to know but she 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.879
 costs 1 981 9000 euros now I do not 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.430
 do not know I do not know the price 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.879
 finally the real price of this car there 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.769
 now at voili voilou it's a price 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.090
 which remains expensive for a car in far 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.829
 here I am now 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.359

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.019
