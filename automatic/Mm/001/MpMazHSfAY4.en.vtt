one<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.330> can<00:04:39.360> think<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.110> I've<00:04:40.260> seen

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
one that I can think of that I've seen

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.160 
one that I can think of that I've seen
is<00:04:40.950> hellsing<00:04:41.700> ultimate<00:04:41.850> which<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.900> was<00:04:43.140> a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
is hellsing ultimate which I was a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.590 
is hellsing ultimate which I was a
really<00:04:43.680> big<00:04:43.860> fan<00:04:44.190> back<00:04:44.640> in<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.910> day<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.390> the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
really big fan back in the day of the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.960 
really big fan back in the day of the
original<00:04:46.020> Hellsing<00:04:46.440> anime<00:04:46.980> but<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.670> is<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
original Hellsing anime but this is the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.660 
original Hellsing anime but this is the
OVA<00:04:48.420> which<00:04:48.810> more<00:04:49.320> closely<00:04:49.590> follows<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.460> manga

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
OVA which more closely follows the manga

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.480 
OVA which more closely follows the manga
on<00:04:51.150> many<00:04:51.660> levels<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.740> yeah<00:04:52.920> I<00:04:52.950> think<00:04:53.100> that's

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
on many levels so yeah I think that's

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.580 
on many levels so yeah I think that's
the<00:04:53.640> shortest<00:04:53.940> one<00:04:54.180> I've<00:04:54.390> seen<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.960> date<00:04:55.110> grand
