00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
to learn the exercise and then later on

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.029 
to learn the exercise and then later on
move<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:16.959> county<00:04:17.259> out<00:04:17.320> loud<00:04:17.500> into<00:04:17.889> your

right<00:04:34.090> which<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.300> sometimes<00:04:34.750> we<00:04:35.500> let<00:04:35.620> our<00:04:35.770> mind

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
right which is sometimes we let our mind

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.110 
right which is sometimes we let our mind
wander<00:04:36.340> like<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:36.789> that's<00:04:36.909> going<00:04:37.060> to

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
wander like that and that's going to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.670 
wander like that and that's going to
affect<00:04:37.389> our<00:04:37.479> timing<00:04:37.930> all<00:04:38.260> right<00:04:38.380> that's<00:04:38.500> why

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
affect our timing all right that's why

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.420 
affect our timing all right that's why
we're<00:04:38.800> going<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:38.979> have<00:04:39.070> that<00:04:39.159> sweet

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
subdivision so cool let's try this

00:04:41.050 --> 00:05:13.450 
subdivision so cool let's try this
exercise<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.590> get<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.710> little<00:04:42.039> quicker

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.280

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
loud do all those variations of stuff

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.250 
loud do all those variations of stuff
let<00:05:24.090> me<00:05:24.120> show<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.330> another<00:05:24.630> variation<00:05:24.990> that

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
let me show you another variation that

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260 
let me show you another variation that
I'd<00:05:25.350> like<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.620> do<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.040> this<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:26.700> really<00:05:26.940> common

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
I'd like to do and this is really common

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.390 
I'd like to do and this is really common
with<00:05:27.480> a<00:05:27.510> lot<00:05:27.690> of<00:05:27.750> exercises<00:05:28.170> that<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:28.890> that<00:05:29.370> I

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
with a lot of exercises that I that I

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.340 
with a lot of exercises that I that I
teach<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.330> is<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:30.630> do<00:05:30.720> this<00:05:30.840> variation

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
teach and that is to do this variation

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.580 
teach and that is to do this variation
backwards<00:05:32.100> what<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:32.730> mean<00:05:32.940> by<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.120> is<00:05:33.590> start

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
backwards what I mean by that is start

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.500 
backwards what I mean by that is start
with<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.010> last<00:05:35.250> pattern<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:36.060> start<00:05:36.390> by

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
with the last pattern so start by

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.840 
with the last pattern so start by
playing<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.870> end<00:05:37.110> of<00:05:37.320> four<00:05:37.500> then<00:05:38.310> move<00:05:38.700> our

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
playing the end of four then move our

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.850 
playing the end of four then move our
way<00:05:38.880> towards<00:05:39.540> beat<00:05:39.750> one<00:05:40.020> so<00:05:40.350> we'd<00:05:40.470> go<00:05:40.590> from<00:05:40.770> the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
way towards beat one so we'd go from the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.790 
way towards beat one so we'd go from the
and<00:05:41.040> of<00:05:41.220> four<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.880> beat<00:05:42.030> for<00:05:42.330> beat<00:05:42.630> for<00:05:43.350> to<00:05:43.680> the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
and of four to beat for beat for to the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.720 
and of four to beat for beat for to the
end<00:05:44.040> of<00:05:44.430> 3<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.750> 323<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:47.220> on<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.610> forth

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
end of 3 and of 323 so on and so forth

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.880 
end of 3 and of 323 so on and so forth
so<00:05:48.180> let<00:05:48.630> me<00:05:48.720> try<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:48.900> bad<00:05:49.200> boy<00:05:49.380> for<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:49.770> and

some different things that you can do
with<00:06:29.530> it<00:06:29.560> some<00:06:29.860> different<00:06:30.130> variations<00:06:30.610> that

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
with it some different variations that

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.400 
with it some different variations that
you<00:06:30.880> can<00:06:31.030> work<00:06:31.150> up<00:06:31.360> but<00:06:31.780> more<00:06:31.960> or<00:06:32.050> less<00:06:32.200> that's

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
you can work up but more or less that's

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.110 
you can work up but more or less that's
it<00:06:32.650> from<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:32.980> beginning<00:06:33.340> to<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.460> end<00:06:33.580> so

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
it from the beginning to the end so

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.770 
it from the beginning to the end so
again<00:06:34.450> our<00:06:34.830> goal<00:06:35.830> is<00:06:35.980> here<00:06:36.160> to<00:06:36.310> work<00:06:36.490> on<00:06:36.780> timing

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
again our goal is here to work on timing

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.360 
again our goal is here to work on timing
and<00:06:37.900> subdivision<00:06:38.470> lay<00:06:38.920> this<00:06:39.100> with<00:06:39.280> the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
and subdivision lay this with the

metronome play this with music think

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.480 
metronome play this with music think
about<00:06:41.500> the<00:06:41.650> right<00:06:41.830> thing<00:06:42.070> at<00:06:42.220> the<00:06:42.250> right<00:06:42.340> time

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
about the right thing at the right time

about the right thing at the right time
that's<00:06:42.970> one<00:06:43.120> of<00:06:43.180> the<00:06:43.240> most<00:06:43.390> important<00:06:43.840> skills
