00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.359
 So we start our Dmitry 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.269
 movement and we will work friends 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.300
 mine only by the book of company ratings from 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.370
 because this is our specificity who would 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.410
 neither came to us we always work on 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.539
 the algorithm 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.820
 in such a way by this principle all live 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.890
 so we didn't go anywhere but we 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.189
 did not think of anything mean asked 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 question we instructor whether our 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.630
 methodology to his principles of learning on that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.660
 he replied that you told her 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.059
 you probably have something there your 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 nothing of their own is all common 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.160
 from this we will not move and so 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.230
 dmitriy means where do we start how much 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.590
 action we have to do right 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.600
 at least five important asterisk rules 5 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.690
 all and we will remember five important 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 rules and so what's the first adjustment 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.180
 the driver is remarkably relative 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.969
 pedals 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 it is clear that it turns out that if we 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.220
 move the seat forward back means we 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.560
 feet will work correctly with 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.260
 pedals right at home what first 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.720
 the indicator is the first to seem 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.380
 us is if the feet on the pedal if 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.960
 they work don't pull either at an angle under 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.060
 strong do not stand our feet means everything 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.799
 okay take the middle ground all 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.090
 it is clear yes that is relative to the pedal 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.250
 adjustable back and forth 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.900
 hotels what else modern to regulate in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.229
 penthouse bering seat 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.790
 regarding what about steering 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.520
 Naturally why precisely steering because 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.470
 that it was more convenient to work, I think 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.399
 that believes that the upper part of the south 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.280
 is far away from you lower closer 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.250
 so the steering wheel is located so that you 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.140
 steering time, especially in some 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 extreme conditions could actually 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.700
 rotate the steering wheel and do not tear off the shoulders 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.880
 backs clear yes but you still have 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.670
 should be this attitude and landing 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.009
 lest you sit there like someone to me 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.090
 said like a gopher and you suddenly have how 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.880
 gopher so yes so as not to sit like him 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.670
 sit comfortably lounging and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.520
 actually skillfully manage yet except 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.980
 steering that is necessary on time good 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.780
 landing take into account the correctness yes no I 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 I have a job with something else 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.420
 convenient when properly positioned 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.470
 sit with all the buttons and 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.580
 switches 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.500
 suppose mirror adjustment is all on 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.140
 control panels levers and so on 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.240
 I understand why they should not be dragged 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 further so on understood yes well done 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.800
 great further what second 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 the rule 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.200
 yes we will control you to check 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.240
 according to the method 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.660
 but what should we not see around 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.510
 car while driving like a circle 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.380
 Of course, but what is included in this circle? 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.150
 while it's hot let's do everything in order here 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.220
 so here about the pages that is 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.240
 when you open a page there is always 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.640
 start from top to bottom from left to right no then 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.170
 there we will start yet we started always 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.690
 adjustment but what mirror did they start with 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:24.300
 Well, so be it, it means it means 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.290
 mirrors then dead zones and viewing 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.980
 on the sides and in front 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.790
 yes how often look stressful like 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.219
 cotton wool need 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.439
 need to be considered as 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:40.560
 need a need a while 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.459
 movements are always and therefore every second 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.030
 desirable 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.549
 and you can say so more correctly if 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.000
 it does not interfere with the movement but sometimes we 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:54.659
 make it easier to watch and say what to do 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 divide it into major secondary 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.639
 start to move everything to the left we look 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.700
 I finish the movement all on my right 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.859
 understood yes we say so well we don't 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.829
 we will talk a lot this book 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.909
 method individually for each how 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:17.239
 10 will read the third rules which means 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:19.620
 must marry to quite right and 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.449
 then we will come back and consider what else 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.770
 shop and the fourth rules we 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.820
 close the dmitry including dimensions and 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.620
 low beam headlights 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.910
 that is, you need to say more precisely 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.570
 following for all novice drivers 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.729
 for two full years now 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.110
 traffic we are required to include 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.479
 dipped headlights 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.760
 so here if you turn on the passing beam a 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.210
 here it is possible that immediately turn on 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.610
 And the backlight that is, the dimensions are clear 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.430
 here you can take this Fido 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.870
 method to read well and what else have 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.560
 there is a way to start there 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.530
 Of course, you know, even 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.599
 we are now holding the hands of the book mechanics 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.260
 we will start the machine 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:09.389
 engine and tell you how to do it 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.130
 press the brake pedal can multiply by 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.159
 her yes absolutely right this is the first 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:18.530
 insurance 2 which second was the boy 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.940
 in the parking position is wonderful then 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.570
 western 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.010
 Turn the key forward when back 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.740
 Well, of course a few seconds to 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.960
 people launched the same style he himself 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.060
 return its outcome overlay everything is very 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.770
 we just made the third option 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:41.440
 action in random 4 what is the beginning of what you 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:44.390
 speak fourth that dmitri 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.280
 wake up buddy just now 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.860
 talked 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:53.360
 then you have proved it again 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.730
 inadvertently or not full 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.190
 exception but now it's too late 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.680
 wait a little bit mean again want 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.660
 say coming in car driving lesson 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.950
 I've noticed this thing in practice 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.810
 ask the question you learned before i start 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.270
 asking starts getting lost here for sure 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.500
 just like you i say exactly learned 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.980
 or or read well, I taught that is, or 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.220
 taught 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.410
 taught or taught it does not mean learned 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.690
 there is even such a joke you know i 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.360
 raised the house yes what do you really say 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.919
 raised yes did not raise clear yes that is 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:34.100
 different things raised 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:36.470
 and raised taught or taught has learned 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.080
 it is clear yes again we will return that 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.090
 fourth rules for the inclusion of dimensions 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.919
 why did we do it fourth 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.060
 rules explain simple now everything 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.890
 I will tell it quickly 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.020
 because the engine is running and already 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.669
 battery works and it means 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.919
 Dimension on not included battery 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.020
 it is clear to sit down yes that is the generator 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.310
 working and charging means again 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.350
 let's go first 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:02.360
 so this second seat is mirrors 3 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.750
 engine start 4 dimensions and near 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.820
 headlights and then already started moving well 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.310
 in fact, we told everything fluently 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.290
 the rest can be read in our 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.290
 the company's methodology however. ru
