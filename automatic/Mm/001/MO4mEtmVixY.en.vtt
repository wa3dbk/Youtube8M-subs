00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:20.420
 the question is much more important as it seems to me 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.400
 his last 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.960
 facebook 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.109
 grows on some 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.980
 well i can say for peter and box i 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.980
 I want to say that 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.649
 in view of the fact that the leadership has changed 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.140
 federations 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 here in St. Petersburg and 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.540
 and 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.030
 growth the growth of amateur boxing has become 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.120
 so immediately it started to rain there is growth 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.399
 Natural growth with such here 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.160
 here are tournaments it is natural growth and 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.270
 popularization of sports here in our city 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.270
 in our saint petersburg 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.040
 sinful boxca spout because it is important 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.320
 most of his helmet may 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.860
 refereeing system to 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.909
 feasible that there are 10 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.979
 it will be very interesting to your no 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.140
 Well, it's very difficult to say for sure 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.299
 yes, I guess she's an improvement 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.860
 maybe it turned out to be fraught as well 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.320
 some 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.130
 lower some 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.409
 on the development does not box but what 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.690
 Concerning the removal of helmets I do not know minor 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.940
 injury rate will increase all the same yes I 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.430
 I know I need a glove after all 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.800
 more so not so 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.020
 safe in which you can strike and there 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.510
 knock out there 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.300
 gloves are now that fist to the end 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.990
 impossible to squeeze and practically open 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.510
 hand exchanges earlier there 70s fist 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 was but pitifully ran so hit so hit 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.470
 and now still unfortunately gloves 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.090
 such are so safe and with one 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.230
 I'm good but on the other hand again 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.869
 Zarechnyi boxing lost here may well 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.640
 due to many years 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.650
 now now all the same interest such 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.420
 amateur boxing can be 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.020
 all the same, something that needs to be changed to 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.480
 to attract 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.430
 once again some attention and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.430
 interest in amateur boxing 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.680
 let's star 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.760
 but then she went and she went they 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.420
 topic went interest went 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:45.349
 team tournament leveled boxer 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.950
 good i mean i'll honestly tell me 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:52.519
 even interesting to myself because it’s not that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.270
 what is it something new yes I do not know 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.970
 still all spent enough there in this up 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.280
 what is the regulation how much is there 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.480
 rounds to which minutes you don't know everything 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.130
 interesting to see what it is all about 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.610
 will lead therefore one must try to try 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.680
 do again this once again we are about 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.720
 this we hear once again we show 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.040
 interest in this again popularization 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.040
 goes boxing in general 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.709
 Petersburg from what it was 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.940
 Well 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.830
 tournament I liked the start of the tournament 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.370
 because they were probably 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.680
 the strongest numbers were up to the national team 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.050
 Russia was the strongest such participants 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.600
 then they unfortunately dreamed 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.570
 competition there 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.090
 I don’t know any personal ones there 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.730
 some ideas but in general the tournament 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.310
 went great and great 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.160
 the guys showed boxing levels and very 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.530
 joy for the fact that all the same 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.990
 Petersburg spectators at least for the final on 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.190
 spots semi-finals for the final and thank god 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.860
 what was squeezed out on it 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.350
 visited for the weekend and practically 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.770
 the stands were filled I saw both 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.500
 passions seethed in the hall as they hurt 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.000
 Petrograd and rooted for even the visitors 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.950
 rooting for fairness and refereeing 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.950
 nice to watch what people are going through
