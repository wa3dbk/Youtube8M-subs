John<00:01:41.009> Cena<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> lot<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.360> people

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
John Cena and I think a lot of people

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.179 
John Cena and I think a lot of people
were<00:01:42.659> probably<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.079> name<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:43.649> Randy<00:01:44.040> or

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
were probably to name because Randy or

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.380 
were probably to name because Randy or
and<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.369> thought<00:01:44.520> Randy<00:01:44.880> Orton<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.210> going

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and they thought Randy Orton was going

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
and they thought Randy Orton was going
to<00:01:45.450> return<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.320> obviously<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.310> is
