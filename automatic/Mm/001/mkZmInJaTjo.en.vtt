00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello and welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.510
 chachi guitar let's see this exercise 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.580
 read the finger style finger picking 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.160
 for beginners because although not what 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.860
 It seems very simple and you'll see 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.520
 because we have four blocks the first 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.520
 block 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:41.420
 groups of three always 123 23 points 3 3 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.900
 to catch it is what you feel the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.460
 practical rhythm this the price very at 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.460
 2020 price 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:01.960
 23 23 23 23 very simple 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.199
 and once you have it what you pin 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 pin this even if it does not look like it is also 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.240
 a group of three because he has a trick 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.340
 It has trick is very easy 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:19.409
 not so silence floods a group of three 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.409
 notes silence is not difficult 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.170
 notice that sometimes the sound changed 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.670
 with the palm of my right hand and I do 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.670
 bread technique off 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.390
 locks 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.630
 I start with the price and the price and 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.010
 bound from 1 to 3 well linked or with 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.010
 your finger 2 pulses 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.630
 and how is a silence because we are going to 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.790
 practice this too and it 's that you're going to 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.740
 tap the guitar or go to 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.740
 do whatever it takes to fill 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.090
 action 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.489
 all right 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.680
 practice the tap because this is 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.710
 very well so that you do not lose the rhythm 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 thing and pussy and it gives 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.120
 it terrifies the thing 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.190
 third block exactly same as 1 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.790
 the same thing and from there we have the third 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.780
 block and finally the fourth block 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.240
 we came from the third block that we 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.030
 we are here 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:54.020
 and we just keep going with the groups of 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.530
 three and it's not behind one two three and 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.530
 we start again 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.400
 that is, fourth block 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.599
 and we return 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.040
 the fourth block I am using a 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.990
 Flamenco technique in quotes 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.990
 because I'm alternating fingers 1 and 2 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.209
 you can do it with your finger one 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.440
 2 is very simple 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.880
 and he has no more we will touch everything 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880
 together very slowly 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.470
 Y 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.090
 and 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.930
 i 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.870
 and 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.840
 when you're here and have to go back 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.940
 until you have it assimilated take yourself 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.640
 the time you want 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.320
 to go back to fret 2 of the third 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.000
 rope and start over 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.500
 that is, you do not have to go super 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.200
 block because you're not going to go to the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.730
 first and you keep thinking what is it 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.830
 that comes like this we come back again for the 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.830
 principle you stay there nothing happens 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.910
 ah 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.290
