00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello there was a small pause 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.960
 between the rollers but it took time to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.910
 last stage of promotion 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.590
 it was necessary to final even under 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.219
 player formula has been parted 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.990
 component and starting grouting work 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.160
 with our painstaking and tell him 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.020
 modest results 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.580
 but it had to be done to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.890
 find out what methods really 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.619
 working or something you all the same 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.330
 succeeded in the cake fell off some 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 guess what i stuck to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529
 first video about fees namely what 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 asks for the lion's share gives rise to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.700
 Kernel is it necessary to concentrate 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.670
 efforts even magical rest 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 components of the built-in north bridge 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.379
 RAM on top of Egypt times 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.390
 overclocking the north has become extremely small 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 increment issued but add 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.640
 instability and do not allow the kernel to exit 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.760
 on such agent hypertransport tire 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.829
 similar 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.960
 has a large margin in speed and and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.890
 overclocking or there the wolf does not affect 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.949
 overall speed 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.629
 the plan for working with the device, we put as 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.539
 turned out to be not so sinless and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.220
 the make buttons stands on i'm not in vain you 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.450
 you know that the flight volume of operatives 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.729
 are determined only in the singular 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.010
 embodiment install modules which when 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.990
 assembly seemed to me right if 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.130
 rearrange according to the instructions determined 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 only four gigabytes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.159
 very strange because there plus will come out 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.210
 all modules correctly determine their volume 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.409
 if you click ok lotara crested shopping in 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.479
 other combinations either not at all 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 starts or determined steps makes 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.400
 so I had to return the original 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.259
 view of course if there is a set of 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.090
 identical slats of similar problems 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.970
 should not occur but with different 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.159
 asus modules are extremely capricious so 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.110
 owners of similar models take on 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.549
 note 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.070
 the memory frequency was still slightly 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.020
 eventually increase the exchange rate 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.729
 increased base 21 you say 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 second to form 20 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.619
 and what should their heroes do well 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.049
 programs as encoders archivers 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.010
 simpler specifically applications but in 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.650
 most games will only have a mouth of 12 fps 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.090
 one word and the final outtaled not 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.340
 beats off time spent 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.500
 the case of a game there but apart from mind 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.420
 overclocking there are programs it will be 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.520
 improve performance from the process 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.450
 associated with the adjustment works 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.820
 diet system 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.670
 Half Irga savings and distribution 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.650
 loads soldered maybe some 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.700
 heard chicks like a bulldozer 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.730
 conditioner bad course drank yandex check 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.460
 the first two optimize work minus 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.040
 ikse the last is just a setting 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.110
 the operation mode of the berries is the fact that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.810
 there is such a thing as perfect 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.730
 the core of one side food tends 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.220
 evenly distribute the load across all 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.580
 i'm a friend offering rotation executable 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.920
 process or at low load 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.960
 going to process in one core 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.130
 the rest of the park that is translated in 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.770
 condition with minimal 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.590
 power consumption but if translated 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.150
 workflow 1 game for a friend and this 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.190
 may cause some delay 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 observed in games like microfleece 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.670
 so if our process 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.390
 work out on one game 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.620
 the virus does not interfere until it is completed 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.860
 unpacking berries also take some 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.550
 microseconds in general in this work scheme 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.260
 or interfere with a similar type first or 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.290
 from syrup problem for md 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.720
 player rome 2 and tank where speed 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.459
 CPU is critical but it turned out that 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.050
 once leaders walk there when even 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.550
 slightly reduced fps it is also not strange 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.050
 look at the positive reviews about these 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.120
 programs still do not come from 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.489
 owner of computers running zver 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.739
 what a similar eight with their price 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.780
 not bad to work with antoshka at 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.790
 least from distressed games under windows 8 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.890
 street in programs lotions or they 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.780
 depend opera thinly with all 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.030
 updates and latest drivers 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.700
 quite optimized and help 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.100
 different tweaks need no more than that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.019
 meaning to work in the program application 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.220
 must be multi-threaded to 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.410
 use predominantly star 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.750
 forged sneakers and in the computer should 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.930
 stand this video card you 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.760
 held back the process so I will continue you 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.220
 raw in optimized on the production 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.859
 the game and suddenly noticed that in the third 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.620
 Wings ATP has grown up if someone watched 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.760
 tests my previous video before their 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.709
 other youtube videos and 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.690
 crisis 3 is usually tested 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.210
 alcohol stage second level 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.820
 because in the first load on the stage 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.740
 typically high FPS sags on 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.870
 datapacks 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.900
 especially different two side seat i 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.740
 drawdown gives the process each doctors 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.050
 1.3 already trying to grow fps but 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.850
 However, this is not completely solved 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.120
 perfect spot for optimization testing 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.460
 work process last tested 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.110
 just stopped being a bottleneck now 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.690
 one hundred percent loaded video frame 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.270
 to understand exactly what kind of work 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.130
 I had to reinstall windows 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.910
 it turned out that a clean system immediately gives 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.710
 same result 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.750
 may have had a positive effect 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.220
 latest updates eight or 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.100
 fresh video card driver 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.960
 at the end I can say that on the computer 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.000
 with eight 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.740
 noticed even the slightest gain fps about 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.729
 using packs and amd processors 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.220
 e-series 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.220
 and is currently considered the most for 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.229
 this meaningless critically possible 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.720
 getting a small win is not enough 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.819
 optimized to play accurate to 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.440
 catch and just need a long test 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.440
 speakers and other vest
