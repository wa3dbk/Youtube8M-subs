00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.130
 other 52 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:48.550
 So we have to think of ourselves. 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:52.680

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.190
 Let's go down here, this peace had to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 had come this way in white we have to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.940
 poor as a pack 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 it seems that we have here radio radios 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:24.280
 who appeared there and I already have 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.210
 some radios that I modified from 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.260
 true, right? 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:35.950
 now I will minimize and I will that the internet 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:40.270
 to teach us the chat, I will 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.830
 teach you how to usher in the jet of some 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.250
 creditors for 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.110
 You can also search for various maggi 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.110
 I had long been looking for radios 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.510
 Portuguese I found more for failures 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.510
 Brazilian and those things , right? 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.510
 radio 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.870
 I got some accounts 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.090
 If you go here on the radio, you do not want me to. 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.450
 I could give an example 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.190
 so we have some nef radios 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.190
 People here have an invitation to see if you like 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:29.110
 It seems that we here, right? 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:36.190
 this ip voip nÃ© 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.680
 the notepad can be elsewhere in 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.610
 any think it has here in 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:49.690
 college where I see the ips is one after 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:53.230
 more sure until the bar 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.780
 this bar can never erase never 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.840
 can erase homelessness 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.980
 this bar is not worth noting 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.980
 will the radio work 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.070
 clear appears with ipi because you see 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:21.030
 I like you here 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:26.560
 the pawn in the name the Brazilian name and I 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:30.000
 I'll give you a tip, this is what we have 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.000
 another page 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:46.950
 The Portuguese women I could find 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:46.950
 I've been looking for it for a long time. 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.060
 make a video lesson explaining how the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.110
 111 that ouvis there is no video on 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:09.790
 youtube like the portuguese radios 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:17.700
 Brazilians, the idea is that the attack on 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.700
 antenna 1 that the portuguese pt city fm 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:33.580
 commercial radio 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:35.440
 that's why we come here is all this 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:42.040
 not worth it but I think it has to 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.650
 sure everything so far worth copying 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.840
 this is people 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:55.590
 from here in 1195 and you too 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.919
 any area is in Notepad 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:05.110
 copy 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:06.669
 we arrived here we paid to spend and pompoms 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.009
 z control 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:16.460
 op to france as you want 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:17.719
 ah I already understand a fm citizen and the radio 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.469
 commercial 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.909
 just think today more and more the radio 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:31.599
 commercial because my favorite by 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:33.800
 This is what we're going to be in the game. 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:38.059
 as it is my first video has a 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:41.449
 small but left corner 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:51.879
 I think I can make video 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:58.490
 Let this team and I start the game play 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:06:09.860
 exists or enters here in my 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:12.680
 I think those radio 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.870
 as I explained that will give - you do not 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.770
 can take that little bar that she came 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.349
 right 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:23.120
 if they pay to save I think it will not 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:29.629
 to go wrong on a TV that radios already have 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:31.069
