on the shores of the Dead Sea the mud is

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.520 
on the shores of the Dead Sea the mud is
then<00:00:50.740> harvested<00:00:51.310> from<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.610> banks<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.270> sea

this<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:53.740> very<00:00:53.980> potent<00:00:54.430> mud<00:00:54.700> so<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.030> wouldn't

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
this is a very potent mud so I wouldn't

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.630 
this is a very potent mud so I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:55.840> it<00:00:56.170> if<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:56.620> have<00:00:56.710> sensitive<00:00:57.220> skin

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
recommend it if you have sensitive skin

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.480 
recommend it if you have sensitive skin
I<00:00:57.850> use<00:00:58.540> it<00:00:58.690> twice<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.020> month<00:00:59.230> at<00:00:59.620> most<00:00:59.950> with

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
I use it twice a month at most with

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.340 
I use it twice a month at most with
occasional<00:01:00.910> spa<00:01:01.420> treatments<00:01:02.050> that<00:01:02.200> have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
occasional spa treatments that have

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.749 
occasional spa treatments that have
proven<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:02.920> be<00:01:02.950> very<00:01:03.460> very<00:01:03.700> effective

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
proven to be very very effective

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.580 
proven to be very very effective
you<00:01:06.759> can<00:01:06.970> reconstitute<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.900> mud<00:01:08.079> with<00:01:08.320> water

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
you can reconstitute the mud with water

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can reconstitute the mud with water
as<00:01:08.829> well<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.400> like<00:01:09.880> very<00:01:10.210> watery<00:01:10.630> consistency

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
as well I like very watery consistency

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:21.899 
as well I like very watery consistency
so<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.710> goes<00:01:11.950> on<00:01:12.189> as<00:01:12.399> a<00:01:12.460> very<00:01:12.819> thin<00:01:13.179> layer

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.480 

on<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.420> clean<00:01:22.780> face<00:01:23.079> I<00:01:23.380> apply<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.860> mask

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
on a clean face I apply the mask

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.700 
on a clean face I apply the mask
beginning<00:01:24.939> with<00:01:24.969> problem<00:01:25.539> areas<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.439> thin

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
beginning with problem areas the thin

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.920 
beginning with problem areas the thin
consistency<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.520> this<00:01:27.759> mixture<00:01:28.149> allows<00:01:28.600> for

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
consistency of this mixture allows for

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.319 
consistency of this mixture allows for
buildable<00:01:29.320> coverage<00:01:29.890> meaning<00:01:30.460> I<00:01:30.700> can<00:01:30.909> go<00:01:31.060> back

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
buildable coverage meaning I can go back

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.060 
buildable coverage meaning I can go back
and<00:01:31.630> add<00:01:31.780> more<00:01:31.810> wherever<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.500> feel<00:01:32.799> is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
and add more wherever I feel is

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.550 
and add more wherever I feel is
necessary<00:01:33.450> brian<00:01:34.450> adds<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.079> sodium

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
necessary brian adds to the sodium

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.620 
necessary brian adds to the sodium
chloride<00:01:35.950> content<00:01:36.250> or<00:01:36.640> salt<00:01:37.000> if<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.299> will

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
chloride content or salt if you will

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.779 
chloride content or salt if you will
which<00:01:38.229> makes<00:01:38.470> this<00:01:38.710> mix<00:01:38.979> just<00:01:39.189> stronger<00:01:39.549> than

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
which makes this mix just stronger than

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:40.350 
which makes this mix just stronger than
most

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
most

00:01:40.360 --> 00:02:18.750 
most
hence<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.929> twice<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.170> month<00:01:41.319> with<00:01:41.740> tea

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.970 

fifteen<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.720> twenty<00:02:20.049> minutes<00:02:20.170> later<00:02:20.560> when<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
fifteen to twenty minutes later when the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.520 
fifteen to twenty minutes later when the
mask<00:02:21.189> is<00:02:21.370> fully<00:02:21.640> dry<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.299> use<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.569> wet<00:02:22.900> washcloth

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
mask is fully dry I use a wet washcloth

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.740 
mask is fully dry I use a wet washcloth
to<00:02:23.829> remove<00:02:24.099> it<00:02:24.280> there<00:02:24.849> are<00:02:25.030> particles<00:02:25.299> in<00:02:25.659> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
to remove it there are particles in the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.660 
to remove it there are particles in the
mud<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:25.989> could<00:02:26.409> irritate<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.099> skin<00:02:27.430> if

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
mud that could irritate the skin if

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460 
mud that could irritate the skin if
you're<00:02:27.879> too<00:02:28.150> rough<00:02:28.390> or<00:02:28.629> too<00:02:28.720> quick

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
you're too rough or too quick

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.229 
you're too rough or too quick
I<00:02:29.500> recommend<00:02:30.189> washing<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.670> mud<00:02:30.849> off<00:02:31.030> with

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
I recommend washing the mud off with

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.600 
I recommend washing the mud off with
tepid<00:02:31.510> water<00:02:31.689> instead<00:02:32.409> of<00:02:32.470> using<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:33.069> washcloth

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
tepid water instead of using a washcloth

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.559 
tepid water instead of using a washcloth
as<00:02:33.849> I'm<00:02:34.180> doing<00:02:34.360> here<00:02:35.069> finally<00:02:36.069> rinse<00:02:36.370> tone<00:02:37.209> and

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
as I'm doing here finally rinse tone and

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.350 
as I'm doing here finally rinse tone and
moisturize<00:02:38.049> I<00:02:38.620> keep<00:02:39.129> the<00:02:39.310> leftover<00:02:39.819> mud<00:02:40.060> for

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
moisturize I keep the leftover mud for

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.180 
moisturize I keep the leftover mud for
spot<00:02:40.629> treatments<00:02:41.260> where<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.620> will<00:02:41.799> only<00:02:42.040> use

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
spot treatments where I will only use

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.610 
spot treatments where I will only use
the<00:02:42.340> mud<00:02:42.670> for<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:43.150> spot<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.810> extinguish<00:02:44.409> those

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
the mud for one spot to extinguish those

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.979 
the mud for one spot to extinguish those
