00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.760
 see how to make motor brakes 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.410
 mounted so today we will cover this 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 topic in the case of different mufflers 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.900
 from this these original will be 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 necessary to remove this we can 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.800
 leave it mounted then proceed with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.800
 remove the wheel 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.550
 let's return this couple now 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 for those who do not have an air gun is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.879
 just use an iron and go to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.430
 fix the drum and then with a key 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.430
 ratchet to unscrew this nut 

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:18.539
 we take these little clips that you already have 

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:26.459
 got to see one and then first 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:29.729
 the other time we operate the lever and we go 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:35.310
 put in place of our ganassi 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.149
 see at this point we just have to 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.149
 get them out 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:07.710
 we prepare our new trains 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:17.549
 let's put the spring we go to put a 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:22.500
 some grease on this pin these for 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:27.349
 facilitate entry now 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.349
 we position the new trains 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:59.970
 we loosen our leverage and not 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:07.300
 put it back in place we verify 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:09.630
 functioning we reposition our own 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.630
 bills 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.880
 and the old man 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.799
 always make sure that the sheath of 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:42.260
 brake line is always in its seat 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:42.260

00:03:46.909 --> 00:04:26.729
 Catches game we are going to then open
