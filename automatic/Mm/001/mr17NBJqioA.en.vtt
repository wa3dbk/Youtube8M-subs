I love running into claim waters that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.970 
I love running into claim waters that
are<00:00:50.370> obviously<00:00:51.000> visible<00:00:51.559> but<00:00:52.559> apparently<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
are obviously visible but apparently I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
are obviously visible but apparently I
don't<00:00:53.160> look<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> ground<00:00:53.430> too<00:00:53.820> often<00:00:54.320> but

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
don't look at the ground too often but

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
don't look at the ground too often but
this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.829> tactical<00:00:56.250> knife<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.550> classes

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
silenced gun so and I don't know if I've

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
silenced gun so and I don't know if I've
ever<00:01:00.090> ranted<00:01:00.690> about<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.050> before<00:01:01.579> but<00:01:02.579> i

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
ever ranted about this before but i

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.560 
ever ranted about this before but i
think<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> SMGs<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.799> game<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.570> pathetic

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
think the SMGs in this game are pathetic

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.250 
think the SMGs in this game are pathetic
this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.770> assault<00:01:08.040> rifle<00:01:08.100> game<00:01:09.140> there's<00:01:10.140> no

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
this is an assault rifle game there's no

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
this is an assault rifle game there's no
use<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.920> even<00:01:11.159> use<00:01:11.310> an<00:01:11.460> SMG<00:01:11.760> unless<00:01:12.119> you're

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
use to even use an SMG unless you're

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.859 
use to even use an SMG unless you're
planning<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.540> maybe<00:01:12.720> rust<00:01:13.880> which<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.509> very

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
planning on maybe rust which I do very

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.999 
planning on maybe rust which I do very
very<00:01:16.229> rarely<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:19.790> yeah<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.540> very

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
very rarely but yeah this is just a very

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
very rarely but yeah this is just a very
hardcore<00:01:23.009> assault<00:01:23.729> rifle<00:01:24.030> game<00:01:24.210> there's<00:01:24.689> no

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
hardcore assault rifle game there's no

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.249 
hardcore assault rifle game there's no
reason<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> use<00:01:26.040> an<00:01:26.189> SMG<00:01:26.840> when<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> assault

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
reason to use an SMG when the assault

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
reason to use an SMG when the assault
rifle<00:01:28.619> basically<00:01:28.979> does<00:01:29.159> everything<00:01:30.079> it's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
rifle basically does everything it's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.649 
rifle basically does everything it's
close<00:01:31.259> quarter<00:01:31.740> long<00:01:32.520> range<00:01:32.880> basically

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
close quarter long range basically

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.980 
close quarter long range basically
everything<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.020> need<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> um<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
everything you need but um out of the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.450 
everything you need but um out of the
SMGs<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.680> guess<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> UMP<00:01:38.700> silenced<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.860> for

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
SMGs I guess the UMP silenced is the for

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.030 
SMGs I guess the UMP silenced is the for
me<00:01:41.579> I've<00:01:42.140> gotten<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> most<00:01:43.409> success<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
me I've gotten the most success out of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.420 
me I've gotten the most success out of
it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.080 

I<00:01:48.320> pick<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.440> I<00:01:49.710> pick<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> light<00:01:50.520> machine<00:01:50.880> gun

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and I'll admit I don't think i've ever

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.550 
and I'll admit I don't think i've ever
used<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:55.770> light<00:01:56.220> machine<00:01:56.550> gun<00:01:56.730> in<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.000> game<00:01:57.560> i

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
definitely need to kind of mix it up a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.670 
definitely need to kind of mix it up a
little<00:02:01.440> bit<00:02:02.390> but<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.320> goes<00:02:04.470> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
little bit but here it is here goes the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.600 
little bit but here it is here goes the
lag<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.820> game<00:02:06.060> has<00:02:06.360> plenty<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.610> but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130

than<00:02:23.160> eighty<00:02:23.489> percent<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> time<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.360> just

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
than eighty percent of the time it just

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.900 
than eighty percent of the time it just
picks<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> exact<00:02:25.140> same<00:02:25.320> house<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.130> they<00:02:26.700> still

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
picks the exact same house so they still

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.750 
picks the exact same house so they still
got<00:02:27.090> some<00:02:27.570> tweaking<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:29.250> needs<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.550> be<00:02:29.640> done

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
got some tweaking that needs to be done

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
got some tweaking that needs to be done
with<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.600> see<00:02:30.959> look<00:02:31.230> at<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.350> was

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
with that as I see look at that was

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.060 
with that as I see look at that was
migration<00:02:32.040> I'm<00:02:32.190> still<00:02:32.489> lagging<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.970> Hill<00:02:33.180> so

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
migration I'm still lagging my Hill so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.290 
migration I'm still lagging my Hill so
somehow<00:02:35.070> managed<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.580> get<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.790> kill<00:02:36.090> though

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
somehow managed to get a kill though

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.300 
somehow managed to get a kill though
just<00:02:36.570> spraying<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.170> guy<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.590> sniper

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.160 

so<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.520> slow<00:02:44.790> game<00:02:45.030> I'll<00:02:45.390> admit<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.110> I

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so it's a slow game I'll admit but I

00:02:46.170 --> 00:03:00.020 
so it's a slow game I'll admit but I
promised<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.830> ends<00:02:48.020> very<00:02:49.020> quickly
