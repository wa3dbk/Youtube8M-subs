00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.860
 tutorial is only for people 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.829
 basic those who do not know how to use movie 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.039

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.429
 that here you have a picture a video x 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.300

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.250
 Photo 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.170

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.040

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.409
 you want well and so the titanic sank 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.310
 Oh my ears 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.290
 Well, we left that well, well, I do not know 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.050
 let's cut all this because if not 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.880
 it's going to be saved and it's going to last a lot 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.290
 cut it up to 5 minutes of a 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.860
 minute 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.860
 there is running 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.530
 let's stop there we will go we 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.530
 more for here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.380
 to see more for each one 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 to see more here 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.080
 ah 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.550
 Almost she almost arrived 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.080
 so I doubt a little bit then doubt rather 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.920
 most of the case is this file 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.040
 save 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 and they put him I do not know 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.890
 ross 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.790
 and good they put in youtube they put to him 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.790
 upload video 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:13.940
 they put you select guys 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:16.730
 in videos here here is going to tell you this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.269
 good of a girl this is also from me 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.099
 maikel they are going to open it and take it say 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.200
 this the talk file is not a project 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.780
 you can apply here but for 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.890
 course my tutorials are much more 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.440
 Great, I do not know what they're going to do 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.370
 already for the file here where it says 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.370
 post movie 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.239
 and therefore it will not publish 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.920
 there is no more science here where he has 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.670
 posted this movie here where it says 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.510
 here on this team read next 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:57.090
 here he puts the name does not look 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.980
 next and here you can put the quality 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.020
 or the best quality this is the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.270
 recommended although here you can already 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.130
 put the the if they want but you 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.580
 I recommend the first unless they are left 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.900
 compress it to a kb which what is 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.900
 impossible to have 100 meters 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.990
 to see I do not know if it can be said I'm going to 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.390
 laugh a lot I do not know was compressed less than 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.600
 60 kilos because there is no I'm not finished 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.209
 space in the public age and it's going to 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.510
 start posting or they give you 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.519
 Finalize 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.700
 and he stays in his movie he's going to 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.700
 play 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.010
 swallowed 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.620
 good is going to look good costs 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.349
 of change in configuration now yes 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.680
 and they will accept the video is not 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.450
 they show him more videos 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.520
 around here and it's going to go up 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.950
 automatically as you can see 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.790
 it goes up really cool and I do not think it 's because 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.790
 summer when you progress 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.640
 do not wait a second I just want to see 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.760
 how is it in good youtube this would be 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.319
 it was the tutorial there, they all care 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.319
 effects to effects 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.970
 and although you do not notice 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.019
 good x in that if they keep it and then well 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.019
 to see how it was 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.330
 to see see 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:37.120
 in his power and super good that would be his 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.120
 video, I hope you liked it
