much as i did in bc and i think that's

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.990 
much as i did in bc and i think that's
because<00:06:01.200> with<00:06:01.620> flying<00:06:01.920> mounts<00:06:02.340> people<00:06:02.670> aren't

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000

as<00:06:03.090> apt<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.840> gank<00:06:04.080> as<00:06:04.320> they<00:06:04.470> used<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:04.860> be<00:06:04.950> but

as apt to gank as they used to be but

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.280 
as apt to gank as they used to be but
again<00:06:05.730> what<00:06:06.000> do<00:06:06.090> you<00:06:06.180> think<00:06:06.450> yes<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.050> flying
