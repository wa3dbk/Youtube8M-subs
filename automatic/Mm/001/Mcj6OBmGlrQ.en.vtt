00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.929
 biodiversity at first sight to 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.599
 biodiversity can be understood as 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.000
 a variability of life on earth or 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.490
 simply all life on the planet 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.949
 us and delve into this concept 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.580
 we'll see that things go well beyond that 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.130
 in 1992 at the convention on diversity 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.590
 biological river 92 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.599
 an official definition of the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.119
 biodiversity concept 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.340
 it defines biodiversity as the 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.570
 inter-agency variability 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.280
 all origins 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.969
 including terrestrial ecosystems 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.950
 and other aquatic ecosystems 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.579
 and the ecological complexes they 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.440
 part 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.110
 diversity. 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.699
 of species between species and 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.680
 ecosystems to understand this 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.110
 better let's go for parts 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.270
 to begin with, imagine a population of 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.070
 canaries remembering that the individual of 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.120
 one population are all from the same 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.879
 species 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.770
 if we observe this population we will see 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.409
 how organisms are similar between 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.229
 but a closer look reveals 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.630
 variations within the population as the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.770
 peak height eye color 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.409
 this site 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.900
 these small differences guarantee 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.520
 particular unique features 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.600
 of each individual within that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.060
 population 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.729
 this happens in nature in all 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.770
 instances including in the human 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.009
 it is enough to see how we are alike and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.869
 same time so different between us 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.970
 this variation within a species is 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.100
 generated by variations in dna 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.250
 transmitted from generation to generation by 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.119
 bodies at that level of 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.140
 biodiversity we give away from 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.140
 Genetical diversity 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.090
 continuing our discussion there 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.570
 the so-called diversity of 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.460
 organisms with phylogenetic diversity 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.890
 which encompasses the accumulation of differences in 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.990
 genetic code of populations and 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.270
 formation of new species 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.159
 understanding not only the different 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.009
 species but all of its past 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.509
 evolutionary 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.030
 now we will be a group of beings 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.860
 living in a space we can understand the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.470
 biodiversity as the relationship between 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.970
 wealth and abundance of species in that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.980
 local 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.709
 to better understand this scheme 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.720
 each quadrant represents an area of 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.640
 each figure represents not only the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.920
 species that inhabit it but also its 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.780
 number of individuals being 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.310
 wealth the number of different species 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.190
 in the environment 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.840
 the richest area is the area b because in it 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.920
 we noticed the largest number of species 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.049
 many different 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.519
 abundance on the other hand concerns 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.160
 the number of individuals in a 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.900
 concerning the quantity of all 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.180
 the living beings in that environment 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.940
 thus, the area with greater abundance 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.690
 is the area and there are more abundant species 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.489
 and it is this here now which of the areas 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.420
 has the best relationship between wealth and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.769
 abundance which is more biodiverse 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.420
 probably your answer will be and the 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.560
 then it has a great abundance 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.540
 with a great wealth of species 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.849
 Finally, biodiversity also 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.130
 comprises the various relationships between 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.530
 beings in and between living beings 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.299
 and the places where they live at that level 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.060
 biodiversity we call it the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.489
 ecological diversity encompassing all 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.200
 biochemical biological processes and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.230
 behavioral disorders found in 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.290
 ecosystems of the whole earth 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.299
 restoring biodiversity can be 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.190
 studied at various levels between 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.160
 individuals of the same species or 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.109
 genetic diversity between individuals of 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.530
 different species from their ancestors 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.599
 or phylogenetic diversity and with 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.859
 product of biological interactions and 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.840
 ecosystems or ecological diversity 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.709
 but after all how life has become diverse 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.780
 How is it today? 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.159
 This has always been the case and 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.360
 importance of preservation of 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.910
 biodiversity in all their names 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.650
 the answers to these questions and more 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.770
 read the biodiversity book 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.930
 tropical of paulo sant'ana and max martins 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.930
 Thank you for watching, see you soon.
