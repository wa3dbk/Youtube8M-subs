00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
alright guys today we're gonna try to

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.470 
alright guys today we're gonna try to
cook<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.330> hot<00:00:03.659> dog<00:00:06.140> the<00:00:07.140> batteries<00:00:08.210> now<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.240> don't

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
cook a hot dog the batteries now I don't

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.089 
cook a hot dog the batteries now I don't
laugh<00:00:09.690> just<00:00:10.080> yet<00:00:10.349> III<00:00:10.769> think<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.759> done

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
laugh just yet III think it can be done

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.279 
laugh just yet III think it can be done
it's<00:00:14.099> not<00:00:14.280> dissimilar<00:00:14.610> from<00:00:15.030> those<00:00:15.630> electric

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it's not dissimilar from those electric

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's not dissimilar from those electric
hot<00:00:16.500> dog<00:00:16.740> cookers<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.550> used<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.910> make

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
hot dog cookers that they used to make

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.490 
hot dog cookers that they used to make
where<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.359> would<00:00:18.539> actually<00:00:18.720> put<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> thawed

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
where you would actually put a thawed

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.810 
where you would actually put a thawed
hot<00:00:19.770> dog<00:00:20.039> get<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.180> between<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:22.050> electrodes

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
hot dog get this between two electrodes

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.980 
hot dog get this between two electrodes
that<00:00:23.820> were<00:00:23.970> directly<00:00:24.420> connected<00:00:24.510> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that were directly connected to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.740 
that were directly connected to
household<00:00:25.500> current<00:00:26.000> it<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.180> be<00:00:27.300> done

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
household current it can be done

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.229 
household current it can be done
oh<00:00:27.779> yes<00:00:29.269> but<00:00:30.269> anyway<00:00:30.599> these<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:30.869> frozen

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
oh yes but anyway these are frozen

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.280 
oh yes but anyway these are frozen
if<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> didn't<00:00:33.719> break<00:00:33.870> Mike<00:00:35.989> just<00:00:36.989> wanted<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
if it didn't break Mike just wanted to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.170 
if it didn't break Mike just wanted to
prove<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.770> they're<00:00:37.950> frozen<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:39.140> yeah

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
prove that they're frozen you know yeah

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.200 
prove that they're frozen you know yeah
emphasis<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:43.460> cracked<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.820> forgot<00:00:45.059> this

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
emphasis on cracked it I forgot this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.720 
emphasis on cracked it I forgot this
thing<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> glass<00:00:46.219> what<00:00:47.219> we're<00:00:47.340> gonna<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
thing is glass what we're gonna do is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.639 
thing is glass what we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.910> chisel<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.930> hot<00:00:49.200> dog<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
we're gonna chisel off one hot dog and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
we're gonna chisel off one hot dog and
we're<00:00:49.770> gonna<00:00:49.860> let<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.129> thaw<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.420> rest

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
we're gonna let it thaw out and the rest

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.450 
we're gonna let it thaw out and the rest
of<00:00:51.750> these<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> freezer<00:00:53.840> okay

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
of these are going in the freezer okay

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
of these are going in the freezer okay
all<00:00:56.460> wired<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> our<00:00:58.079> Forks<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.739> energized

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
all wired up and our Forks are energized

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
all wired up and our Forks are energized
we're<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> prove<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.469> using<00:01:01.469> our

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we're going to prove that using our

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.290 
we're going to prove that using our
multimeter<00:01:02.129> let's<00:01:02.460> make<00:01:02.640> sure<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.090> have

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
multimeter let's make sure that we have

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.280 
multimeter let's make sure that we have
the<00:01:03.629> adequate<00:01:04.019> amount<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:05.180> voltage<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the adequate amount of voltage going to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.719 
the adequate amount of voltage going to
our<00:01:07.409> Forks<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> appears<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.830> me<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.549> we

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
our Forks and it appears to me like we

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.969 
our Forks and it appears to me like we
have<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.150> total<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.900> fifty<00:01:13.290> two<00:01:13.500> point<00:01:13.740> three

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
have a total of fifty two point three

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
have a total of fifty two point three
volts<00:01:15.290> backed<00:01:16.290> by<00:01:16.560> ten<00:01:16.979> amps<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.720> kick-ass

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
volts backed by ten amps of kick-ass

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.060 
volts backed by ten amps of kick-ass
okay<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> we're<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> put<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> fork<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
okay so we're going to put the fork and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.880 
okay so we're going to put the fork and
one<00:01:23.490> end<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> thawed<00:01:24.390> hot<00:01:24.630> dog<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.650> we're

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
one end of the thawed hot dog and we're

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
one end of the thawed hot dog and we're
gonna<00:01:26.009> put<00:01:26.250> another<00:01:26.369> fork<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.509> end

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
gonna put another fork in the other end

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.080 
gonna put another fork in the other end
and<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.450> theory<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.890> sodium<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> hot

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and the theory is the sodium in the hot

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.649 
and the theory is the sodium in the hot
dog<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:34.340> actually<00:01:35.340> working<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.270> hear<00:01:36.509> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
dog is actually working I can hear it

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.380 
dog is actually working I can hear it
the<00:01:37.229> sodium<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> hot<00:01:38.310> dog<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.790> conducting

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the sodium in the hot dog is conducting

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.460 
the sodium in the hot dog is conducting
the<00:01:39.540> current<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:40.140> us<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.229> bit

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the current for us and in a little bit

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.460 
the current for us and in a little bit
of<00:01:43.700> time<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> fully<00:01:45.960> cooked<00:01:46.290> hot

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
of time we will have a fully cooked hot

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.429 
of time we will have a fully cooked hot
dog<00:01:48.380> by<00:01:49.380> using<00:01:50.329> electricity<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.990> actually

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
dog by using electricity it's actually

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.050 
dog by using electricity it's actually
working<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.770> hot<00:01:55.920> dog<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.340> warming<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:56.969> oh

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
working the hot dog is warming up oh

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.990 
working the hot dog is warming up oh
sweet<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.369> long<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.820> gonna<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.030> but

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.620 

wiring<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.150> uh<00:02:08.180> still<00:02:09.020> pretty<00:02:09.260> cool<00:02:10.450> but<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.600> is

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
wiring is uh still pretty cool but it is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.320 
wiring is uh still pretty cool but it is
conducting<00:02:12.350> current<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:16.150> couldn't<00:02:17.150> tell<00:02:17.210> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
conducting current I couldn't tell you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.020 
conducting current I couldn't tell you
how<00:02:17.450> much<00:02:18.700> how<00:02:19.700> much<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.000> draw<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:22.030> we're

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
how much how much the draw is we're

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.390 
how much how much the draw is we're
actually<00:02:23.210> cooking<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.990> hot<00:02:24.200> dog<00:02:24.440> using<00:02:24.980> battery

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
actually cooking a hot dog using battery

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.030 
actually cooking a hot dog using battery
power<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:29.540> appliance<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> see<00:02:30.800> look<00:02:30.920> at

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
power the appliance that I see look at

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.920 
power the appliance that I see look at
that<00:02:31.160> it's<00:02:31.550> it's<00:02:32.890> actually<00:02:33.890> starting<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.400> burn

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.690 

we<00:02:38.930> can't<00:02:39.170> let<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.470> fork<00:02:39.710> touch<00:02:39.980> because<00:02:40.460> that

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
we can't let the fork touch because that

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.370 
we can't let the fork touch because that
would<00:02:40.850> be<00:02:40.970> disastrous<00:02:43.780> plug<00:02:44.780> in<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.080> flipping

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
would be disastrous plug in the flipping

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.580 
would be disastrous plug in the flipping
in<00:02:45.680> there

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.280 

smells<00:02:51.590> delicious

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.839 

just<00:02:57.830> want<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.099> make<00:02:58.220> sure<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> battery

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
just want to make sure that the battery

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.059 
just want to make sure that the battery
doesn't<00:02:59.300> start<00:02:59.629> getting<00:02:59.840> hot<00:03:00.020> or<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.500> wiring

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
doesn't start getting hot or the wiring

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.100 
doesn't start getting hot or the wiring
doesn't<00:03:01.610> start<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:01.910> heat<00:03:02.030> up<00:03:02.060> because<00:03:02.840> that

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
doesn't start to heat up because that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:17.210 
doesn't start to heat up because that
would<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.319> bad

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.380 

all<00:03:18.220> right<00:03:18.340> we've<00:03:18.490> let<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.760> cook<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.210> a<00:03:19.240> little

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
all right we've let it cook for a little

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.130 
all right we've let it cook for a little
while<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:19.870> I'm<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.110> bit<00:03:20.260> concerned<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
while but I'm a bit concerned that the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.230 
while but I'm a bit concerned that the
electroplating<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> fork<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.460> actually

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
electroplating on the fork is actually

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.320 
electroplating on the fork is actually
coming<00:03:25.630> off<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.080> fork<00:03:27.390> now<00:03:28.410> 121<00:03:29.410> degrees<00:03:29.740> 120

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
coming off the fork now 121 degrees 120

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.990 
coming off the fork now 121 degrees 120
600<00:03:31.330> knots<00:03:31.660> 79<00:03:32.230> there<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.530> got<00:03:32.770> 127<00:03:33.250> over<00:03:33.760> here

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
600 knots 79 there I got 127 over here

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.520 
600 knots 79 there I got 127 over here
and<00:03:34.660> 91<00:03:35.170> there<00:03:36.810> yeah<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.870> believe<00:03:38.020> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
and 91 there yeah I believe the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.440 
and 91 there yeah I believe the
electroplating<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.460> fork<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.970> actually

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
electroplating in the fork is actually

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.780 
electroplating in the fork is actually
starting<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.320> absorb<00:03:41.620> into<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.220> hot<00:03:42.400> dog<00:03:42.610> so

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
starting to absorb into the hot dog so

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.820 
starting to absorb into the hot dog so
we<00:03:42.910> won't<00:03:43.120> be<00:03:43.210> eating<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:43.780> hot<00:03:43.990> dog<00:03:45.210> but<00:03:46.210> I

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
we won't be eating this hot dog but I

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.230 
we won't be eating this hot dog but I
just<00:03:47.830> wanted<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.130> prove<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.460> there<00:03:48.820> is<00:03:48.850> more

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
just wanted to prove that there is more

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.520 
just wanted to prove that there is more
than<00:03:49.390> one<00:03:49.600> way<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.810> skin<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.230> cat

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
than one way to skin a cat

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.040 
than one way to skin a cat
and<00:03:51.090> more<00:03:52.090> than<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:52.330> way<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.510> cook<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.870> hot<00:03:53.020> dog

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
and more than one way to cook a hot dog

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.480 
and more than one way to cook a hot dog
I<00:03:54.690> did<00:03:55.690> notice<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.020> if<00:03:56.230> ITIF<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.860> have<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.310> if

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
I did notice that if ITIF I have the if

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.690 
I did notice that if ITIF I have the if
the<00:03:57.670> fork<00:03:57.910> came<00:03:58.120> out<00:03:58.300> once<00:03:58.570> already<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.700> I

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
the fork came out once already and I I

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.550 
the fork came out once already and I I
had<00:04:00.970> my<00:04:01.000> finger<00:04:01.540> on<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.840> hot<00:04:01.990> dog<00:04:02.230> because<00:04:02.470> I'm

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
had my finger on the hot dog because I'm

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.290 
had my finger on the hot dog because I'm
trying<00:04:02.860> to<00:04:03.070> put<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.370> fork<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.820> I'm<00:04:04.030> getting

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
trying to put the fork and I'm getting

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.610 
trying to put the fork and I'm getting
shocked<00:04:04.660> each<00:04:04.990> time<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:07.350> now<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.410> hot

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
shocked each time I do it so now the hot

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.040 
shocked each time I do it so now the hot
dog<00:04:08.830> is<00:04:09.010> beginning<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.400> smoke<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.840> think

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
dog is beginning to smoke and I think

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.890 
dog is beginning to smoke and I think
we're<00:04:11.140> gonna<00:04:11.230> end<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:11.590> right<00:04:11.740> there<00:04:12.750> or<00:04:13.750> we

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
we're gonna end it right there or we

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.610 
we're gonna end it right there or we
could<00:04:14.020> keep<00:04:14.200> going<00:04:14.260> until<00:04:14.710> it<00:04:14.920> blows<00:04:15.250> up

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
could keep going until it blows up

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.650 
could keep going until it blows up
speaking<00:04:17.620> of<00:04:17.860> blowing<00:04:18.040> things<00:04:18.250> out<00:04:18.670> 136

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
speaking of blowing things out 136

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.070 
speaking of blowing things out 136
degrees<00:04:19.810> hundred<00:04:20.680> thirty<00:04:20.890> set<00:04:21.160> up<00:04:21.370> no<00:04:22.080> 275

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
degrees over on the end here 129 127 so

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.740 
degrees over on the end here 129 127 so
it's<00:04:29.290> now<00:04:29.470> officially<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> hot<00:04:30.550> dog<00:04:30.820> oh<00:04:31.680> boy

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
it's now officially a hot dog oh boy

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.040 
it's now officially a hot dog oh boy
still<00:04:34.750> smells<00:04:35.080> delicious<00:04:35.650> though<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:37.660> as<00:04:37.810> I'm

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
still smells delicious though but as I'm

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.870 
still smells delicious though but as I'm
sudden<00:04:38.560> as<00:04:38.800> I'm<00:04:38.980> telling<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.520> there<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
sudden as I'm telling you there the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.730 
sudden as I'm telling you there the
there<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.360> some<00:04:40.390> electroplating<00:04:41.350> coming<00:04:41.620> off

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
there is some electroplating coming off

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.170 
there is some electroplating coming off
the<00:04:41.920> fork<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.520> don't<00:04:42.580> want<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:42.880> mess<00:04:43.030> with

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
the fork and I don't want to mess with

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.280 
the fork and I don't want to mess with
that<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.870> won't<00:04:44.530> be<00:04:44.650> eating<00:04:44.980> this<00:04:45.160> one<00:04:46.290> so

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
that so I won't be eating this one so

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.240 
that so I won't be eating this one so
anyway<00:04:48.070> what<00:04:48.280> was<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.520> saying<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:50.130> think<00:04:51.130> in

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
anyway what was I saying I think in

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.700 
anyway what was I saying I think in
order<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.670> cook<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.180> hot<00:04:52.480> dog<00:04:52.510> without<00:04:52.990> the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
order to cook a hot dog without the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.880 
order to cook a hot dog without the
plating<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:55.660> know<00:04:55.780> becoming<00:04:56.140> one<00:04:56.440> with<00:04:56.470> the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
plating you know becoming one with the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.730 
plating you know becoming one with the
food<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.400> believe<00:04:58.210> AC<00:04:58.540> is<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.530> way<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.920> go<00:05:00.190> oh

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
food I believe AC is the way to go oh

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.690 
food I believe AC is the way to go oh
yeah<00:05:02.740> now<00:05:02.920> it's<00:05:03.070> starting<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.370> get<00:05:03.490> really

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
yeah now it's starting to get really

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.590 
yeah now it's starting to get really
okay<00:05:04.450> we're<00:05:04.870> gonna<00:05:04.960> end<00:05:05.200> our<00:05:05.410> little

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
okay we're gonna end our little

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.830 
okay we're gonna end our little
experiment<00:05:07.600> right<00:05:07.900> there<00:05:09.510> see<00:05:10.510> how<00:05:10.600> I<00:05:10.630> did

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
experiment right there see how I did

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.840 
experiment right there see how I did
that<00:05:11.010> all<00:05:12.010> right<00:05:14.280> let's<00:05:15.280> take<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.430> look<00:05:15.640> at<00:05:15.730> our

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
that all right let's take a look at our

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.719 
that all right let's take a look at our
delicious<00:05:17.280> delicious<00:05:18.280> hot<00:05:18.700> dog

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.870 

so<00:05:22.729> my<00:05:23.060> fork<00:05:23.479> what<00:05:24.320> happened<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.830> my<00:05:24.979> fork<00:05:25.340> okay

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.279 

all<00:05:28.880> right<00:05:29.030> I'm<00:05:29.120> gonna<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:29.840> sort<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.110> cut

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
all right I'm gonna just sort of cut

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:31.450 
all right I'm gonna just sort of cut
myself<00:05:30.470> off<00:05:30.949> here

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
myself off here

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.490 
myself off here
so<00:05:31.610> what<00:05:31.880> really<00:05:32.090> happened<00:05:32.270> here<00:05:32.840> is<00:05:32.990> my<00:05:33.139> fork

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
so what really happened here is my fork

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.330 
so what really happened here is my fork
has<00:05:33.770> etched<00:05:34.039> itself<00:05:34.729> as<00:05:35.030> you<00:05:35.479> can<00:05:35.600> clearly<00:05:35.750> see

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
has etched itself as you can clearly see

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.340 
has etched itself as you can clearly see
now<00:05:37.340> it's<00:05:37.610> not<00:05:37.850> a<00:05:37.910> plated<00:05:38.630> fork<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.199> is

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
now it's not a plated fork it is

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.340 
now it's not a plated fork it is
stainless<00:05:39.650> steel<00:05:40.600> and<00:05:41.600> what<00:05:41.990> ended<00:05:42.229> up

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
stainless steel and what ended up

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.680 
stainless steel and what ended up
happening<00:05:42.410> was<00:05:42.949> the<00:05:43.460> fork<00:05:43.789> was<00:05:43.970> connected<00:05:44.509> to

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
happening was the fork was connected to

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.450 
happening was the fork was connected to
the<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.210> anode<00:05:47.690> side<00:05:48.560> of<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:48.889> battery<00:05:49.100> or

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
the to the anode side of the battery or

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.090 
the to the anode side of the battery or
the<00:05:49.490> positive<00:05:50.150> side<00:05:50.419> of<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.660> battery<00:05:51.100> because

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
the positive side of the battery because

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.129 
the positive side of the battery because
the<00:05:52.520> hotdog<00:05:53.680> was<00:05:54.940> basically<00:05:55.940> made<00:05:56.270> of<00:05:56.479> half

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
the hotdog was basically made of half

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.210 
the hotdog was basically made of half
sodium<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:59.600> hotdog<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.380> its<00:06:00.650> moisture

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
sodium the hotdog and its moisture

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.409 
sodium the hotdog and its moisture
content<00:06:01.699> created<00:06:02.300> almost<00:06:02.720> like<00:06:03.020> a<00:06:04.030> light<00:06:05.030> bath

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
content created almost like a light bath

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.140 
content created almost like a light bath
and<00:06:07.630> it<00:06:08.830> actually<00:06:09.830> used<00:06:10.100> that<00:06:10.639> coupled<00:06:11.120> with

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
and it actually used that coupled with

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.870 
and it actually used that coupled with
the<00:06:11.360> electrical<00:06:11.780> current<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:13.250> caused<00:06:13.610> the

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
the electrical current it caused the

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.390 
the electrical current it caused the
fork<00:06:14.240> to<00:06:14.539> basically<00:06:14.960> reverse<00:06:15.560> plate<00:06:16.039> itself

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
fork to basically reverse plate itself

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.430 
fork to basically reverse plate itself
and<00:06:16.789> you<00:06:17.449> can<00:06:17.599> look<00:06:17.690> at<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.960> end<00:06:18.110> does<00:06:18.410> it

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
and you can look at the end does it

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.070 
and you can look at the end does it
leave<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.699> positive<00:06:20.330> side<00:06:20.870> of<00:06:21.020> the

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
leave the the positive side of the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.710 
leave the the positive side of the
hotdog<00:06:21.470> and<00:06:21.710> it's<00:06:21.770> almost<00:06:22.039> black<00:06:22.669> and<00:06:23.539> what

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
hotdog and it's almost black and what

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.500 
hotdog and it's almost black and what
you're<00:06:23.870> really<00:06:24.169> seeing<00:06:24.500> is<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:25.479> metal<00:06:26.479> that

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
you're really seeing is the metal that

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.439 
you're really seeing is the metal that
was<00:06:26.780> dissolved<00:06:27.560> into<00:06:27.770> the<00:06:27.949> hotdog<00:06:28.430> from<00:06:29.210> that

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
was dissolved into the hotdog from that

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.870 
was dissolved into the hotdog from that
fork<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:31.250> other<00:06:31.400> fork<00:06:31.820> on<00:06:32.030> the<00:06:32.360> cathode<00:06:33.139> side

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
fork the other fork on the cathode side

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.939 
fork the other fork on the cathode side
was<00:06:34.880> completely<00:06:35.389> fine<00:06:35.660> had<00:06:36.229> we've<00:06:36.500> had<00:06:36.770> both

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:36.949 
was completely fine had we've had both

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.550 
was completely fine had we've had both
Forks<00:06:37.430> placed<00:06:37.760> in<00:06:38.030> a<00:06:38.240> solution<00:06:39.139> an

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
Forks placed in a solution an

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.210 
Forks placed in a solution an
electrolyte<00:06:40.099> solution<00:06:41.680> salt<00:06:42.680> water<00:06:42.919> for

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
electrolyte solution salt water for

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.080 
electrolyte solution salt water for
example<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:45.560> other<00:06:45.770> fork<00:06:46.250> would<00:06:46.580> have<00:06:46.729> been

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
example the other fork would have been

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.010 
example the other fork would have been
coated<00:06:47.539> with<00:06:47.990> the<00:06:48.409> metal<00:06:48.770> from<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:50.020> anode

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
coated with the metal from the anode

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.610 
coated with the metal from the anode
fork<00:06:51.550> and<00:06:52.550> as<00:06:53.270> you<00:06:53.780> see<00:06:53.990> right<00:06:54.020> through<00:06:54.320> the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
fork and as you see right through the

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.320 
fork and as you see right through the
hotdogs<00:06:54.979> away<00:06:55.190> because<00:06:55.520> the<00:06:55.669> hotdog<00:06:56.090> was

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
hotdogs away because the hotdog was

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.710 
hotdogs away because the hotdog was
completely<00:06:57.139> inedible<00:06:58.030> you<00:06:59.030> can't<00:06:59.360> eat<00:06:59.570> a

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
completely inedible you can't eat a

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.080 
completely inedible you can't eat a
metal<00:07:00.139> hotdog<00:07:00.560> well<00:07:01.220> you<00:07:01.430> could<00:07:01.699> but<00:07:01.880> it<00:07:01.970> would

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
metal hotdog well you could but it would

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.480 
metal hotdog well you could but it would
be<00:07:02.180> really<00:07:02.479> disgusting<00:07:02.900> and<00:07:03.320> that's<00:07:04.070> it<00:07:04.310> for

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
be really disgusting and that's it for

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.110 
be really disgusting and that's it for
this<00:07:04.610> video<00:07:05.120> thanks<00:07:05.659> for<00:07:05.690> watching
