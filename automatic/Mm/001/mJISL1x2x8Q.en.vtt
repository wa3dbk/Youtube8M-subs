00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
of the steel mesh now we have heating
this<00:00:42.239> heating<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.629> run<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.899> zones<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
this heating is run in zones we have a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
this heating is run in zones we have a
front<00:00:43.860> zone<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> back<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.760> onto<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030

do radiant baseboard in this house and
so<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.270> we've<00:00:51.420> got<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:52.640> wherever<00:00:53.640> our

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
so what we've got here is wherever our

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
so what we've got here is wherever our

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and you can see this is under the stairs

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400 
and you can see this is under the stairs
so<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> heats<00:00:59.219> quite<00:00:59.520> far<00:00:59.760> apart<00:01:00.410> entryway

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
so the heats quite far apart entryway

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
so the heats quite far apart entryway
we've<00:01:01.829> got<00:01:02.010> heat<00:01:02.190> concentrated<00:01:02.940> by<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.120> front

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
course of stairs so that the concrete

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.669 
course of stairs so that the concrete
flows<00:02:08.390> right<00:02:08.599> around<00:02:08.840> some<00:02:09.049> guys<00:02:09.229> pour<00:02:09.530> it

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679

around the stairs we think you get a
better<00:02:13.760> finish<00:02:14.090> when<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.299> actually<00:02:14.420> just

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
better finish when you actually just

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.660 
better finish when you actually just
pour<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.349> whole<00:02:15.470> floor<00:02:15.709> as<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> big<00:02:16.099> huge<00:02:16.340> slab

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.640 
pour the whole floor as a big huge slab
so<00:02:17.090> not<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.629> way<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.959> everybody<00:02:18.290> does<00:02:18.470> it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
so not the way that everybody does it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.520 
so not the way that everybody does it
this<00:02:18.799> way<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.069> we<00:02:19.190> do<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:20.049> works<00:02:21.049> good<00:02:21.290> for<00:02:21.440> us

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530
