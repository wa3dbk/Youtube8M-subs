00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.260
 very, very good people, this is a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.299
 very special story 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.520
 Many people have seen it but have not 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.770
 idea of who is or rather who was 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.289
 the manatee that is in our hearts 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.010
 the great troll eada of surfing radios in the 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.010
 history of champions 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.360
 well before I started I wanted to tell you 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.800
 that I found two stories about this 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.750
 champion so it's going to be a little 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.410
 mix of both stories without modifying 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.119
 the main story ok we already begin to 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.310
 despite the traditions and attitudes 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.020
 peaceful of his people the manatee war 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.579
 always idolized in the forces and 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.739
 skills of the champions of the league of 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.690
 legends and always tried hard to 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.790
 become one of all the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.010
 champions of the league that I admired the most 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.170
 was jacques the weapons master because 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.699
 they will ask is because already ex has the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.500
 record of consecutive victories and 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.530
 because he also only struggles using his 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.059
 bluff so one in his admiration and his 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.519
 quest to become a teacher 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.870
 of weapons like jacques has been equipped with 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.629
 the two great symbols of their heritage 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.940
 manatee a fish as a symbol of will and 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.920
 of providence of the sea and a spatula 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.560
 to pay homage to his people in the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.600
 search for culinary expertise this is 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.010
 how your quantum journey begins with the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 hope to cross your weight and your 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.050
 spatula against the lamppost of them all 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.280
 well it 's there true I'm sure that 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.600
 with this they have the ussr in their 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.490
 hearts 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.100
 ok then I'm going to force him to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.200
 change I continue to prepare for acquaintances 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.780
 many league champions especially 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.190
 the air were already very good friends and 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.440
 I talk to the heads of the field of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.450
 justice warning them that ur 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.880
 his species was unique and that only 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 there would be was a good trigger and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.960
 plus a cook after a while 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.030
 in the training camps or receive a 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.490
 be accepted in the league and therefore 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.869
 I was going to be too many friends but not all 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.970
 the world was legit 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.280
 warwick as a symbol of envy you 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.729
 surfer prepares a trap not know 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.860
 warwick 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.020
 therefore warwick left him a bottle 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.640
 in an area where group used to swim surf 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.880
 reaches to see the bottle and the bottle 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.130
 have a note the note said welcome 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.259
 to the healthy league of justices that you will be 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.220
 well received and treated if you want 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.190
 know me better 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.410
 let's get together on the beach at sunset 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.090
 after reading the urgent note is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.570
 amazed by the friendliness of his friend and 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.010
 warwick so he decided to go after 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.380
 a lot of talk they had a little 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.390
 discussion the next day around the world 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.500
 I was looking for savings and the last one 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.690
 he saw him alive 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.030
 warwick to the only thing they found was to 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.560
 warwick the disappearance of ur was 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.360
 pretty strong for some more than a 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.220
 others to go him and this was 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.780
 practically a stroke of anger was the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.150
 Summoner's crack only for 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.010
 kill in death symbol revenge 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.720
 one was in the whole press 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.850
 everyone was sad except 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.430
 warwick to which everyone saw quite 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.440
 happy after a while and many 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.820
 interviews our big for being the last one in 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.130
 see alive 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.050
 was the main suspect there was a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.670
 trial which came out without charges because 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.310
 nobody saw it and there was no evidence 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.840
 enough one had died and never again 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.519
 more would go back 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.040
 very good people that has been the story 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.900
 from urf I hope you liked it now 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.550
 I'm going to explain a little bit of why I said 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.680
 that was the great radio entrance is at 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.709
 start of the good video was supposed to 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.150
 I was really going to be an announced champion 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.459
 but it was all a joke for the day of 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.989
 the innocent so instead of the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.340
 champion came out a special corner of 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.620
 Barbie is going to leave now 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.420
 screen this skin is supposed to me 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.790
 It was around 5000 suddenly if 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.200
 I'm not mistaken and the very few people who 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.030
 he dared to spend 5,000 records 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.580
 kings realize that they were actually 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.040
 50 rp is why very few people the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.390
 have I had only the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.700
 opportunity to see it once inside the 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.560
 game during that period of time 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.540
 Rays donated much of his profits 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.060
 they were a foundation that was called 6 of 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.769
 manatee noble organic point x-ray gesture 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.720
 got married because it was a foundation that 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.560
 responsible for saving external to that is already 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.569
 in danger of extinction 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.730
 now as you will know in the game there are many 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.870
 things that make reference to ur by 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.420
 example here I 'm going to leave some of 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.799
 background if you have seen the skin of o 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.900
 borough the butcher that is a corner 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.120
 special that is not sold in the fund is 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.680
 see a piece of meat hanging that says 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.170
 in a poster half a kilo of manatee 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.489
 obviously reference now happens what 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.409

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.409
