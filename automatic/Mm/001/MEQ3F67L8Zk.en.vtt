works<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> blender<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.719> food<00:00:15.900> processor

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
works as a blender and a food processor

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.710 
works as a blender and a food processor
as<00:00:16.740> well<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> bunch<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.060> other<00:00:18.150> stuff<00:00:18.449> what

we're doing today is using it as a food
processor<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.990> would<00:00:22.619> use<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> food<00:00:23.160> processor

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
processor you would use a food processor

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.820 
processor you would use a food processor
to<00:00:24.090> chop<00:00:24.119> vegetables<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.529> you're<00:00:25.680> making

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to chop vegetables like if you're making

going to use some so we're going to
start<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.570> by<00:00:43.050> putting<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.800> handl

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
start out by putting in good handl

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
start out by putting in good handl
carrots<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.539> enough<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.680> really

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
carrots in there just enough to really

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.729 
carrots in there just enough to really
get<00:00:47.430> us<00:00:47.579> started<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.180> probably<00:00:48.480> about

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
get us started that's probably about

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.880 
get us started that's probably about
about<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> cup<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> half<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.239> carrots<00:00:52.140> and

you aren't going to use those are you
okay<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.690> we're<00:00:58.140> starting<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.980> by<00:00:59.340> putting<00:00:59.699> on

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
okay so we're starting out by putting on

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
okay so we're starting out by putting on
the<00:01:00.149> lid<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.840> replacing<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> lid<00:01:01.850> right<00:01:02.850> up

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the lid and replacing the lid right up

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.010 
the lid and replacing the lid right up
top<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.890> there<00:01:05.479> with<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.630> snaps

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
top it is just on there with those snaps

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.710 
top it is just on there with those snaps
so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.820> any<00:01:09.090> Vitamix

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
so you can do this with any Vitamix

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.149 
so you can do this with any Vitamix
machine<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.909> here's<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.119> secret<00:01:12.950> if<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
machine and here's the secret if you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
machine and here's the secret if you
start<00:01:14.520> out<00:01:14.670> by<00:01:15.259> taking<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.560> all<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> way<00:01:17.009> up

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
start out by taking this all the way up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.850 
start out by taking this all the way up
to<00:01:17.310> ten<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.909> high<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> demolish

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to ten or high it's going to demolish

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
to ten or high it's going to demolish
those<00:01:20.310> carrots<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:20.939> tiny<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.450> bits<00:01:21.720> if

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
those carrots into tiny little bits if

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
those carrots into tiny little bits if
you<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.530> something<00:01:22.830> about<00:01:22.979> cooking<00:01:23.430> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you know something about cooking you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
you know something about cooking you
want<00:01:25.110> basically<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.799> rough<00:01:26.159> chop<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.759> those

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
want basically a rough chop on those

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
want basically a rough chop on those
carrots<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.650> we're<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
carrots and how we're going to do that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.149 
carrots and how we're going to do that
is<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.210> leave<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.049> lowest<00:01:31.530> setting<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
is to leave it on the lowest setting and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.600 
is to leave it on the lowest setting and
then<00:01:32.790> use<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.600> tamper<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> how<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.460> going

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
then use the tamper so how we're going

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.539 
then use the tamper so how we're going
to<00:01:35.700> start<00:01:36.000> again<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to start again is on one I'm going to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
to start again is on one I'm going to
turn<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.740> already

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
turn this in you can see it's already

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.590 
turn this in you can see it's already
moving<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:41.970> we're<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
moving and then we're going to use the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.520 
moving and then we're going to use the
tamper<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.290> just

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
tamper to just

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.490 
tamper to just
down<00:01:44.740> puts<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.400> cards<00:01:45.729> down<00:01:46.110> into<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.200> blades

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
down puts the cards down into the blades

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.920 
down puts the cards down into the blades
a<00:01:47.890> very<00:01:48.340> simple<00:01:48.760> process<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.420> we're<00:01:49.570> starting

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
a very simple process so we're starting

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.840 
a very simple process so we're starting
on<00:01:50.049> one<00:01:50.260> and<00:01:50.650> it's<00:01:50.950> already<00:01:51.250> chopping<00:01:51.640> them<00:01:51.760> up

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
on one and it's already chopping them up

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.149 
on one and it's already chopping them up
but<00:01:52.119> let's<00:01:52.630> get<00:01:52.810> them<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.049> little<00:01:53.350> more<00:01:53.560> chopped

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.410 

just<00:01:57.159> keep<00:01:57.340> pushing<00:01:57.670> them<00:01:57.759> down<00:01:58.000> into<00:01:58.270> the

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
just keep pushing them down into the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.050 
just keep pushing them down into the
blade<00:01:58.630> not<00:01:59.320> going<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.590> hurt<00:01:59.710> anything<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
blade not going to hurt anything and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.639 
blade not going to hurt anything and
that's<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.210> nice<00:02:04.420> rough<00:02:04.750> chop<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.320> carrots

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
that's a nice rough chop on the carrots

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.990 
that's a nice rough chop on the carrots
let's<00:02:05.800> do<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.100> little<00:02:06.250> bit<00:02:06.460> more<00:02:06.640> just<00:02:06.880> so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
let's do it a little bit more just so

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.309 
let's do it a little bit more just so
you<00:02:07.090> can<00:02:07.180> see<00:02:09.780> move<00:02:10.780> them<00:02:10.899> around<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.290> little

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
you can see move them around a little

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.600 
you can see move them around a little
bit<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:15.600> here

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
bit and here

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.610 
bit and here
you<00:02:18.610> have<00:02:18.850> your<00:02:19.239> nice<00:02:19.540> roughly<00:02:20.230> chopped

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
you have your nice roughly chopped

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.759 
you have your nice roughly chopped
carrots<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.690> how<00:02:22.690> we<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:23.050> those<00:02:23.230> out<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
carrots and how we get those out you can

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.280 
carrots and how we get those out you can
do<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> couple<00:02:24.250> different<00:02:24.670> ways<00:02:24.850> one<00:02:25.690> way<00:02:25.959> is

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
do it a couple different ways one way is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.640 
do it a couple different ways one way is
to<00:02:26.550> put<00:02:27.550> your<00:02:27.760> cutting<00:02:28.090> board<00:02:28.330> on<00:02:28.540> top<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
to put your cutting board on top and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.620 
to put your cutting board on top and
flip<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.400> over<00:02:30.790> that's<00:02:31.000> totally<00:02:31.450> going<00:02:31.600> to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
flip that over that's totally going to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.870 
flip that over that's totally going to
work<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.050> that's<00:02:32.200> totally<00:02:32.350> fine<00:02:32.700> another<00:02:33.700> way

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
work and that's totally fine another way

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.600 
work and that's totally fine another way
