00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.649
 similar, however, with products that cost 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 less than those used and not only 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.950

 scarlet jones obviously in short we note 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.240

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.320

 gabbana and also the dress of course 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.060
 her being the testimonial also the dress 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.130

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.410

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.080
 well the makeup in that dress the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.770
 red recalls the red of the lipstick 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.910
 and eyes nevertheless left not not 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.050
 very intense just because the look already 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.720
 invested lips are they really are 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.370
 so nothing effect so I hope you 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.340

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.870
 let 's see what he did 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 as usual we begin by covering the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.390
 shame and this is the visible list of 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.390
 real 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.710
 also the foundation of the same line 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.860
 I like this line because it contains 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:46.370
 retinol vitamin c then ingredients 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.750
 especially important for non-skins 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.750
 as young as via 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:01.110
 I have to say that we are in charge 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.110
 obviously the cosmetics snow cane 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.530
 for this trick used the ball 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.720
 mou has the balls translate is this 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.300
 is the first color with color 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.800
 lighter slightly frosted goes from 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.800
 apply over the entire eyelid 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:33.820
 the next eye shadow is a color eye shadow 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.720
 very light matte biscuit and I apply it 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.720
 on the eyelid 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.420
 I apply the next color using 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:56.890
 a small brush between shades on the corner 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:00.740
 outside and this is an aubergine brown 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.510
 satin-finish between satin and shimmer 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.510
 very very delicate 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.609
 same color in exchange only the 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.900
 brush and I'm going to apply it on 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.900
 lower eyelid 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.720
 the brown pencil is snow ebony 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.720
 cosmetics 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.080
 I had almost forgotten to apply the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.000
 white pencil is this one is more than another 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.000
 snow cosmetics pastels 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.730
 also to fill the eyebrows 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.730
 I use the pencil and ban 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.040
 I take the blush from the kit with touring blush 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.040
 and ef browser 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.669
 and finally the lips the pencil is the 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.720
 pencil of the debora at the former valleys I think 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:55.510
 number 7 while the lipstick is the number 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.510
 0 0 5 cherry pie di launch cosmetics 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.900
 this is the end result like al 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.700

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.500
