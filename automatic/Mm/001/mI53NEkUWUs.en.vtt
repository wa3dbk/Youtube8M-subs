a leak so far so I thought I'd make a
video<00:00:22.609> about<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:24.210> he<00:00:24.390> leaked<00:00:24.630> about<00:00:24.779> zombies

is<00:01:33.000> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> weird<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.799> exactly

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
is kind of weird and I'm not exactly

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.179 
is kind of weird and I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:35.549> how<00:01:35.880> Treyarch<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:37.140> put<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
sure how Treyarch would put and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.039 
sure how Treyarch would put and
juggernaut<00:01:38.520> into<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> game<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.450> would

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
juggernaut into the game like would

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.639 
juggernaut into the game like would
Joker<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.329> perma<00:01:42.329> perk<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:43.049> would<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Joker not be a perma perk or would you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
Joker not be a perma perk or would you
just<00:01:44.119> automatically<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.270> juggernaut<00:01:46.110> or

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
just automatically have juggernaut or

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
just automatically have juggernaut or
would<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.060> maybe<00:01:48.060> unlock<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.810> through<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
would you maybe unlock it through the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200 
would you maybe unlock it through the
ranking<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.740> system<00:01:50.159> I'm<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.549> exactly<00:01:50.939> sure

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
ranking up system I'm not exactly sure

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.510 
ranking up system I'm not exactly sure
how<00:01:52.189> juggernaut<00:01:53.189> would<00:01:54.290> work<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.560> zombies<00:01:56.189> if

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
how juggernaut would work in zombies if
