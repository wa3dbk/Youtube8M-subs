00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 in the stadium of the Belgian champion 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.480
 Anderlecht must psv the next step 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.059
 put towards the champions league 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.380
 with the traditional press conference 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.660
 months nobody has been sure 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.700
 qualification despite the safe 2 0 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 last week's lead and the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.430
 possible internal problems with the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.150
 opponent can go both ways 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.260
 sometimes provides more togetherness 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.699
 within a team 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.439
 then also with disappointments at one 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.779
 setback 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.239
 fall apart but I do n't think we are 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.670
 have to be very busy with that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.829
 we prepare for the competition 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.040
 how to achieve good results so that we 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.170
 the next underneath that is so so 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.460
 Anderlecht is host because the stadium 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.050
 the car will not meet the european 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.789
 requirements 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.230
 Belgian champion already plays ovens 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.510
 champions league 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 Jeffrey Bruma is still young but has 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.550
 already experience at the highest level 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
 both European and in terms of international matches 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.699
 new match and will be too hard to access 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.930
 is also a difficult difficult task 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.650
 want to be 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.600
 but all have to switch buttons 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.520
 note and show what you expect then 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 match I searched for a quarter that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.830
 we would like to be able to quickly make it alone 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.689
 their and that I think I want us I think 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.130
 of course you have to sit under them 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.200
 internal elimination 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 well must type and gray positive 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.450
 enough 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.640
 it can be experienced but everyone 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.619
 ready and we had our own game 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
 play and so even ready for 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.060
 psv 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.340
 so the appearance in the level so we 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.170
 do everything we can to try 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.900
 places budget sleep this is weird 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.570
 another level and the do the best 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.610
 plow with it in europe yes there we want 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.830
 us gladly participate again 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 Stijn is the man with the most 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.990
 experience in the selection of phillip cocu 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.759
 he is also 1 of the 18 fit players who 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 the trainer has taken to 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.490
 Brussels 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.080
 that the Belgians of Zulu Waregem 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.330
 actually also play an away game 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.310
 changes scarce nothing to the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.920
 psv's preparations for this 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.990
 important duel 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.640
 just prepare it just like 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.050
 otherwise a away match you make the journey 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.090
 behind 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.840
 tonight the quiet training sessions and especially 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.600
 explore 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.019
 so for us nothing previous changes 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.970
 psv won the week convincingly with 2 0 from 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.160
 Zulu Waregem delivered a lot 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.650
 Positive reviews of it is now what one 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.459
 nice very positive response 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.000
 for good distributing club for the players 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.180
 only we know window has been found 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.560
 a not after 1 or 2 matches well 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.280
 general is feeling or doing differently 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.380
 bottom has been a conscious choice 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.780
 which direction we have chosen to take us 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.329
 club are also called training and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.670
 mean to wear directly that is not 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.140
 after two matches must at once 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.690
 you still see faith in the process 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.690
 with the own team 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.140
 the flower and if you stay relaxed 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.030
 as cocu is then that also skips 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.730
 the player group 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.450
 do n't expect me to blurry them now 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.950
 keep on going we just started and on 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.550
 a number of positions is what they are 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.990
 get us out to the players 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.400
 competition 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.430
 importance of the competition is great 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.960
 competitions just started the true sharpness 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.240
 and eagerly grabbing it is actually whole 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.130
 also great on the training at this one 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.930
 whole group 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.820
 yes i would like to see you there 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.460
 trust that it will stay that way 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.190
 so high level service 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.210
 yes it is just so delicious with perfect 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.530
 are you anyway 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.910
 yes exactly yes that's how it was meant for 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.480
 was playing football what would be the under pressure 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.790
 big matches 2 nice but after the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.980
 first west of course , where not 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.170
 only the result but also the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.670
 field game was of a different level 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.900
 between two teams 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.820
 so i guess suffering naturally 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.520
 get up well and do not walk away 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.350
 just again i have nothing to do with that 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.090
 become play and 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.710
 so everything is still possible 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.120
 certainly not playing 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.890
 but if everyone just does their thing 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.200
 put psv in constant vanden 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.100
 stock stadium an important next 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.100
 step in development
