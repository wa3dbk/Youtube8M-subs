combination with the VAR venom which
next<00:00:49.739> two<00:00:49.860> attacks<00:00:50.160> multiplies<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.510> won't

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
next two attacks multiplies this won't

healthy cause immobilized for four
seconds<00:01:24.110> one<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> best<00:01:25.409> abilities<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.130> a

seconds one of the best abilities for a
thief<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.729> opinion<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.470> if<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.619> have

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
thief in my opinion because if you have

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
thief in my opinion because if you have
this<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> two<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> half<00:01:30.450> seconds<00:01:30.900> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
this it's a two and a half seconds of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
this it's a two and a half seconds of
immobilized<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.610> build<00:01:32.880> you'll

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
immobilized and with this build you'll

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.399 
immobilized and with this build you'll
go<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.420> someone<00:01:33.689> down<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.840> 50-percent

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
go to get someone down a 50-percent

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.650 
go to get someone down a 50-percent
health

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
health

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.440 
health
easily<00:01:36.660> in<00:01:36.810> less<00:01:37.050> than<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.260> second<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> it's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
easily in less than a second so it's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
easily in less than a second so it's
another<00:01:39.600> immobilized<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.380> second<00:01:40.980> so<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
another immobilized for second so it's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
another immobilized for second so it's
pretty<00:01:41.370> much<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.730> finisher<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.660> you<00:01:42.810> ask

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
pretty much like a finisher if you ask

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.480 
pretty much like a finisher if you ask
