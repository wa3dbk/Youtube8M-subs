00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
you will definitely have to kill because

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.690 
you will definitely have to kill because
they'll<00:02:39.180> attack<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.460> they're<00:02:41.460> in<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
way of killing the undergrowth and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.330 
way of killing the undergrowth and
dragon<00:02:44.160> moss<00:02:45.530> did<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.650> one<00:02:46.800> drop<00:02:46.980> yeah<00:02:47.310> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
dragon moss did that one drop yeah a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.010 
dragon moss did that one drop yeah a
trump<00:02:47.820> spirit<00:02:48.120> would<00:02:48.270> uh<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:50.420> think<00:02:51.420> that's<00:02:51.780> not

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
trump spirit would uh I think that's not

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.900 
trump spirit would uh I think that's not
only<00:02:52.290> that's<00:02:52.800> going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.070> be<00:02:53.160> my<00:02:53.280> only<00:02:53.490> drop

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
only that's going to be my only drop

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.310 
only that's going to be my only drop
because<00:02:55.130> once<00:02:56.130> again<00:02:56.220> low<00:02:57.000> drop<00:02:57.330> rate<00:02:57.630> but

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
because once again low drop rate but

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.660 
because once again low drop rate but
since<00:02:58.860> they<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.070> drop<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.820> groups<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.150> five<00:03:01.670> or

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
since they do drop in groups of five or

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.280 
since they do drop in groups of five or
at<00:03:02.790> least<00:03:02.820> that's<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.420> I've<00:03:03.630> got<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.080> far

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
at least that's all I've got and so far

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.040 
at least that's all I've got and so far
I've<00:03:04.440> only<00:03:04.560> gone<00:03:04.830> groups<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.430> five<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.780> should

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
I've only gone groups of five it should

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.080 
I've only gone groups of five it should
take<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:08.600> only<00:03:09.600> three<00:03:10.350> drops<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.700> 15

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
take you only three drops to get the 15

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.270 
take you only three drops to get the 15
that<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.420> need<00:03:12.600> for<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:12.930> five<00:03:13.170> gifts<00:03:13.500> however

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
that you need for all five gifts however

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.970 
that you need for all five gifts however
that<00:03:14.459> could<00:03:15.030> wind<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.480> taking<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.080> about<00:03:16.440> like

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
that could wind up taking you about like

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.030 
that could wind up taking you about like
10<00:03:17.459> or<00:03:17.580> 20<00:03:17.850> runs<00:03:18.140> like<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.380> didn't<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.739> get

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
10 or 20 runs like I didn't really get

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.390 
10 or 20 runs like I didn't really get
any<00:03:20.100> spirit<00:03:20.640> was<00:03:20.790> dropped<00:03:21.060> until<00:03:21.570> my<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:23.040> think

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
any spirit was dropped until my I think

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.510 
any spirit was dropped until my I think
it<00:03:23.489> was<00:03:23.550> seventh<00:03:23.970> run<00:03:24.560> but<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.280> pretty

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
it was seventh run but this is pretty

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.340 
it was seventh run but this is pretty
much<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.790> only<00:03:26.970> place<00:03:27.570> i<00:03:27.780> found<00:03:28.050> that's

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
much the only place i found that's

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.250 
much the only place i found that's
efficient<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.920> kill<00:03:29.130> them<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.400> also<00:03:30.330> as<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
efficient to kill them and also as you

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.199 
efficient to kill them and also as you
can<00:03:31.560> see<00:03:31.739> by<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.010> map<00:03:32.250> will<00:03:32.400> bring<00:03:32.610> up<00:03:32.790> for<00:03:33.000> you

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
can see by the map will bring up for you

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.690 
can see by the map will bring up for you
you<00:03:34.050> don't<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.380> have<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> go<00:03:34.860> anywhere<00:03:35.190> you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
you don't really have to go anywhere you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.460 
you don't really have to go anywhere you
stay<00:03:35.910> right<00:03:35.940> next<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> entrance<00:03:36.959> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
stay right next to the entrance and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.410 
stay right next to the entrance and
that's<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.580> going<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.850> be<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.090> end<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.300> this

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
that's just going to be the end of this

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.930 
that's just going to be the end of this
