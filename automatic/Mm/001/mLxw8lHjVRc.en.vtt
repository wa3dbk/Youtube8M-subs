where I could ask as many questions as

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.719 
where I could ask as many questions as
possible<00:01:38.790> where<00:01:39.570> my<00:01:40.380> professors<00:01:41.040> expected<00:01:41.640> a

possible where my professors expected a
lot<00:01:41.970> from<00:01:42.210> me<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.200> surrounded<00:01:43.350> by

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
