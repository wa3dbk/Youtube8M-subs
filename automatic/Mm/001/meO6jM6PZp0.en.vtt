is excellent

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.010 
is excellent
and<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.550> has<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.210> solid<00:00:48.539> feel<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> it

and it has like a very solid feel to it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709 
and it has like a very solid feel to it
but<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.559> suffers<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.460> looking<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but it suffers because it's looking to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.650
