all of the caudally products they're
just<00:00:28.330> a<00:00:28.480> little<00:00:28.810> bit<00:00:28.900> on<00:00:29.019> the<00:00:29.140> expensive<00:00:29.170> side

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
just a little bit on the expensive side

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.729 
just a little bit on the expensive side

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.039 
and I'm sure you've kind of heard of
these<00:00:39.280> it's<00:00:39.879> like<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.379> toner<00:00:41.379> in<00:00:41.830> a<00:00:41.949> spray<00:00:42.309> form

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:43.049 
these it's like a toner in a spray form

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.960 
these it's like a toner in a spray form
but<00:00:44.049> this<00:00:44.350> one<00:00:44.559> is<00:00:44.799> supposed<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.190> be<00:00:45.280> smoothing

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970

and add to a glowing complexion this is
probably<00:00:49.420> actually<00:00:49.720> worth<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.379> hype<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.430> it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
probably actually worth the hype that it

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.840 
probably actually worth the hype that it
gets<00:00:52.239> sometimes<00:00:52.960> these<00:00:53.470> kind<00:00:53.949> of<00:00:54.040> like<00:00:54.339> mist

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
like the size of this so it's super

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.830 
like the size of this so it's super
portable<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.909> is<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:49.060> little<00:01:49.360> bit<00:01:49.570> heavy

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
portable it is a little bit heavy

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.990 
portable it is a little bit heavy
because<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.440> is<00:01:50.590> like<00:01:50.770> real<00:01:51.130> glass<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.909> a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
because this is like real glass it's a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.390 
because this is like real glass it's a
really<00:01:52.270> nice<00:01:52.479> like<00:01:52.870> glass<00:01:53.440> container<00:01:53.979> kind<00:01:54.310> of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
really nice like glass container kind of

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.540 
really nice like glass container kind of
thing<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.900> has<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.260> really<00:01:56.590> nice<00:01:56.950> spray

good<00:02:00.460> thought<00:02:00.640> because<00:02:01.120> it<00:02:01.270> really<00:02:01.540> does<00:02:01.750> mist

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
good thought because it really does mist

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.320 
good thought because it really does mist
the<00:02:02.680> product<00:02:03.130> it's<00:02:03.340> not<00:02:03.490> like<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.880> hair<00:02:04.150> spray

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
the product it's not like a hair spray

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.080 
the product it's not like a hair spray
where<00:02:04.870> you<00:02:05.080> know<00:02:05.229> it's<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:05.920> fat<00:02:06.310> droplets<00:02:06.700> in

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
where you know it's like fat droplets in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.690 
where you know it's like fat droplets in
a<00:02:07.180> stream<00:02:07.510> this<00:02:07.990> really<00:02:08.470> does<00:02:08.649> like<00:02:08.950> mist<00:02:09.429> it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
a stream this really does like mist it

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.859 
a stream this really does like mist it
and<00:02:09.909> so<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:10.060> don't<00:02:10.239> know<00:02:10.299> if<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.479> can<00:02:10.629> kind<00:02:10.750> of

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
and so I don't know if you can kind of

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.730 
and so I don't know if you can kind of
see<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:14.019> really<00:02:14.049> does<00:02:14.500> give<00:02:14.709> a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
see that but it really does give a

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.699 
see that but it really does give a
really<00:02:15.220> nice<00:02:15.430> fine<00:02:15.850> mist<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.500> was<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
really nice fine mist and this was a

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.290 
really nice fine mist and this was a
little<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.160> concentrated<00:02:19.000> because<00:02:19.150> I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
little bit concentrated because I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.750 
little bit concentrated because I
sprayed<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.050> close<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.500> my<00:02:20.620> hand<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.610> you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
sprayed it so close to my hand but you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.670 
sprayed it so close to my hand but you
would<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> close<00:02:22.720> your<00:02:22.870> eyes<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.500> I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
would just kind of close your eyes and I

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.730 
would just kind of close your eyes and I
do<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:24.190> three<00:02:24.610> spritzes<00:02:25.209> like<00:02:25.480> one<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:26.560> my

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
forehead one on each cheek kind of thing

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.440 
forehead one on each cheek kind of thing

herbal e scent to it and all of the
cuddly<00:02:38.470> products<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.250> based<00:02:39.520> out<00:02:39.730> of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
cuddly products are kind of based out of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.589 
cuddly products are kind of based out of
grapes<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:42.099> kind<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.459> faintly<00:02:42.880> smells<00:02:43.300> of

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
grapes so it kind of faintly smells of

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.680 
grapes so it kind of faintly smells of
like<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.590> fresh<00:02:45.160> grapes<00:02:45.790> not<00:02:46.240> like<00:02:46.510> when

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
like you know fresh grapes not like when

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.240 
like you know fresh grapes not like when
you<00:02:46.780> bite<00:02:47.050> into<00:02:47.230> them<00:02:47.530> or<00:02:47.709> anything<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.190> that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
you bite into them or anything like that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.089 
you bite into them or anything like that
but<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.360> just<00:02:49.390> wash<00:02:49.870> off<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> bag<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.860> fresh

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
but if you just wash off a bag of fresh

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.160 
but if you just wash off a bag of fresh
grapes<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.640> kind<00:02:51.849> of<00:02:51.910> has<00:02:52.090> like<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.540> scent<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
grapes it kind of has like that scent to

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.440 
grapes it kind of has like that scent to
it<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:54.099> this<00:02:54.280> especially<00:02:54.819> has<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.000> little

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
it and then this especially has a little

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.350 
it and then this especially has a little
bit<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.840> mint<00:02:56.110> scent<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.680> too<00:02:57.099> so<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:58.090> just

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
bit of a mint scent to it too so it just

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.320 
bit of a mint scent to it too so it just
feels<00:02:58.780> really<00:02:59.530> really<00:02:59.709> refreshing<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
feels really really refreshing and

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.870 
feels really really refreshing and
there's<00:03:02.290> something<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.099> too<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.400> I'm<00:03:03.700> not

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
there's something in it too and I'm not

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.839 
there's something in it too and I'm not
sure<00:03:04.060> which<00:03:04.300> ingredient<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.020> but<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:06.700> not

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
sure which ingredient it is but it's not

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.449 
sure which ingredient it is but it's not
like<00:03:07.060> menthol<00:03:07.569> but<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.110> it's<00:03:08.680> got<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.220> this

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
like menthol but it's it's got like this

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.270 
like menthol but it's it's got like this
really<00:03:10.290> refreshing<00:03:11.290> quality<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.250> that

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
really refreshing quality to it that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.570 
really refreshing quality to it that
actually<00:03:12.880> makes<00:03:13.120> your<00:03:13.330> skin<00:03:13.480> kind<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.020> feel

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
actually makes your skin kind of feel

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.110 
actually makes your skin kind of feel
refreshed<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.840> makes<00:03:17.050> sense<00:03:17.349> but<00:03:17.680> I

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
refreshed and that makes sense but I

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.430 
refreshed and that makes sense but I
think<00:03:19.120> it's<00:03:19.270> actually<00:03:19.450> really<00:03:19.720> worth<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
think it's actually really worth the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.199 
think it's actually really worth the
hype<00:03:20.650> compared<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.250> some<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.610> other<00:03:21.819> kind

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
hype compared to some of the other kind

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.720 
hype compared to some of the other kind
of<00:03:22.270> mists<00:03:22.810> waters<00:03:23.380> or<00:03:23.650> glorified<00:03:24.160> misting

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
of mists waters or glorified misting

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.540 
of mists waters or glorified misting
