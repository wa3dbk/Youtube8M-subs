00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Halli Hello my dear ones today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 I come up with a whole new video for 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.529
 you and there are my five best 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.529
 tricks against cellulitis 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.750
 yes, I used to have a lot of fun 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.010
 That's 20 cents to third grade 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.740
 pretty bitter end three grade 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 divided degree number one is if you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 zeolite is in the process of cutting up the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.700
 skin sees stadium number two is when 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.520
 one pulls to the song at light incidence 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 that is, sitting or on walls of the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.649
 side view and so it is only three 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 So third grade is if you 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.390
 regardless of not a case like that in the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.480
 are both in the lying and in the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.460
 sees sit and I had it up to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.770
 I just had third grade so through 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 the worst form and there is 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.329
 but we ask what is actually 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.809
 counts and that's where I get you 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.790
 small times painted for you and indeed 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.659
 Here we have the connective tissue 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.310
 a woman and now I can never do so 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.090
 clearly explain how it actually works 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 created 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.310
 and here we have it all 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.979
 below our muscles about here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.250
 about that persistent prophet is 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.560
 above that would be our connective tissue 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 area as ours in the tissues and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 these red balls are up here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.479
 cells in the epidermis area 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.400
 what are these wavy here 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.670
 line has caused and that is then 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.430
 in turn, the cellulitis celle are so 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.649
 big fat cells just by the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 Connective tissue no longer everything 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.909
 depot can be kept fit that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.340
 means you are through the connective tissue 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.200
 the epidermis passes and could there 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.030
 just now here nice deposit 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 women are still times stronger 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.990
 as affected as the men with us 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.170
 are they are they are fat cells 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.390
 colleague style and we have one 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.189
 very elastic skin in case of one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.439
 pregnancy in men the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.349
 of course another connective tissue than 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.200
 like women and usually less affected 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.610
 when he started training 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.860
 and me with the nutrition possible 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 are then really mercedes 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.790
 gone gone completely and thus come 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.819
 me right to my very first and 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.459
 main tips sport a lot of movement 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.230
 At best, strength training with the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.380
 We put strength training right here 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.300
 Muscle stimulates and grows 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.330
 thus our skin also crimes 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.209
 because if we are the sydney the pros here 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.489
 decrease by movement and healthy 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.319
 diet maybe a diet and the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.810
 muscle size is affects the skin 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.660
 automatically penalty now is natural 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.819
 it counts mainly in the legs po 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.470
 region and you can just go to 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.430
 example with a pro exercises 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.140
 counteract 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:02.690
 for example, there are very good ones here 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.690
 Exercises such as squat leg press 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.650
 or failure steps 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.240
 point number two diet change 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.280
 And that is a healthy diet 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.440
 a and o and what is actually now 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.330
 a healthy diet in my opinion 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.590
 after that it is just that one firstly one 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.540
 keeps calories in mind 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.580
 Of course you should not too few 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.180
 Eating calories because too little 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.330
 calorie 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.970
 the skin is flabby instead of punitive 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.560
 because too much calorie is of course 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.840
 weight gain and just that 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.440
 enlargement of the fat depot of the same 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.620
 case there naturally increased to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.240
 unprocessed food 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.950
 High protein in combination with 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.290
 healthy fat and complex 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.900
 carbohydrates and all that packed 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.250
 just with fresh food a lot 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.320
 fruit and vegetables 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.470
 so that the skin is a nice 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.590
 Hautbild gets point number three 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.680
 if she should do it eventually 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.530
 quit smoking quit smoking 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.930
 the skin appearance and inhibits the circulation 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.260
 and that's what needs our skin to 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.120
 just punished and stretched and elastic too 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.250
 so maybe stop here 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.739
 point number four change showers if 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.419
 you might even feel hot 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.300
 Showering should be easy after that 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.060
 showering cold if that's for too 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.130
 again the blood circulation of the skin and 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.110
 your blood vessels train each other 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.240
 with warm water from those and cool off 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.880
 contract again and thus arises 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.020
 also movement under the skin like that 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.390
 Now we come to my last 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.790
 fifth point for you and that's the one 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.500
 massage effect for example in the 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.690
 shower or after the shower with one 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 that you are massaging your skin that you 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.760
 thus again promotes the bleeding and 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.380
 as a small tip there for you just now 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.360
 Summertime is already here and if now 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.010
 one last rescue is needed 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.930
 cheat a bit with tanning cream 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.300
 because you pull on tanned skin 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.660
 politically not as strong fails 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.550
 so experience that was my top five 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.290
 tips for you i hope you were very 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.020
 revealing for you maybe 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.550
 what completely new she tries 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.010
 implement then chose on quick 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.050
 achieve results and no one had 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.650
 I also had it earlier 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.110
 and not easy to ignore 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.030
 what give in to his habits 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.160
 change positive habits 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.960
 The video also share a lot with it 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.640
 People get it so many suffer 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.240
 women turn and it really does not have to 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.820
 his 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.070
 and I hope if you liked it 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.200
