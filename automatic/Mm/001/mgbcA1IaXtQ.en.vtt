00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.480
 a new review this time about the anime 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.160
 then two to three match an animated one 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:16.199
 this is not what you see at first glance 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:17.520
 At first it seems to be believed 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.770
 to have a romance animated to do 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.689
 with our main herd carey the one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.460
 particularly strong preference for hair 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.170
 and that he idolizes as the woman 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.609
 even 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.380
 but pretty soon it becomes clear that that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.750
 not the main focus of the anime is 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.120
 because he is rather an action-heavy 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.880
 anime with a technical system with 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.110
 strong episodic trains 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.059
 It's about all of them 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.170
 Hair queen want to kill you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.910
 desire to get granted 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.980
 Kiri not that I'm in her hair 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750
 fell in love and protect her from now on 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 want 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.450
 after I have always looked to the end 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.520
 we go the whole time the question 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.840
 through my head whether the anime without me 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.180
 Maybe not all action 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.890
 would have liked better than the anime 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.170
 has some striking weaknesses 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.850
 starting with the characters all 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.440
 only be treated so superficially 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.940
 And it also does not create sympathy 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.140
 or any other emotion at 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.700
 to trigger spectators 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 this is particularly strong in the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.479
 antagonists to these are mostly 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.750
 shot down as fast as she did 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.470
 were introduced 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.540
 one is isolated while one 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.280
 they brought something closer to them 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 But they seem rather ridiculous and can 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.430
 hardly be taken seriously in the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.560
 general is the reason for the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.640
 Mordlust too trivial and that leaves 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070
 unfortunately also over the complete 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.299
 tell story 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.159
 one finds in this animated too 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.570
 all sorts of quirky figures and I had 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 sometimes even the feeling I am 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.700
 me in a real fetish cabinet 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.490
 with preferences for hair spraying sm and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.560
 unfortunately a lot of lolita work 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.750
 these aspects are rather involuntarily funny 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.479
 as serious in any form 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.250
 or even erotic one would have it safe 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.720
 to build a great atmosphere 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.570
 but it is clear in the implementation 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.220
 you can fail him visually 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.990
 But not blame that they 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.540
 consistently good and there were also 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.159
 quite one to two moments in those 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.649
 the anime grows beyond itself 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.360
 but by and large he is 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.060
 rather a weak presentation and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.190
 therefore only gets 64 out of 100 from me 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.119
 points 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.240
 I can only recommend the anime 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.520
 where you go on lots of pleasure 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.390
 Fan service got it from that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.740
 cybercrime it can do any amount otherwise 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.740
 I only advise against the anime
