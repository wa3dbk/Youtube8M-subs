00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.389
 Hello everyone 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:12.240
 today I'm going to talk to you about age 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.309
 they become those gifts that allow 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 those of the numerical control of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.689
 stepper motors so we have an arduino 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.890
 which on the underside on which we come 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.480
 connect the gildas cnc remember 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.460
 I then have four drivers 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.609
 allow everyone to control a 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.649
 dad motor so this one of 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:44.309
 particulars so he can control 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:47.699
 four xyz axes and to I use four 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.230
 controllers at 49.88 that I found on 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.929
 released the dino dollar embedded software 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.350
 is called grb her and you can the 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:01.499
 find on guide.com have downloaded 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 rbl on github and then we open 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:07.260
 the ideal interface of the dow have so do 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.450
 does the import the bookstore then one 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.820
 goes next to a gerber sample file 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.800
 she gerber the cloud 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.470
 so we just have to upload 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.700
 can open a serial terminal you 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.950
 check that gerber was fine 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.370
 implemented in the journal our backs so 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.070
 the speed is 115 1200 baude so 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.070
 currently in the giant screen bl 0.9 i 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 software on gold 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.469
 drummer who will allow the sending of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.659
 jacquod information can be found on 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.299
 github and his name his eyes of the Aquarius 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.420
 dzeko zender so I use one 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.909
 slightly different version here on 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.670
 sees the name of the port as art says 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.590
 noo so that's like the speed of the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.069
 port by ditches 115 thousand two hundred 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.439
 have made an opening so here we see 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.989
 the information that has been recovered 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.730
 the version the different registers 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.040
 and here the positions of each of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.900
 sliders on xyz so on the cnc 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.910
 shield there is one thing to know it takes 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.299
 to add a strap on the hand and I 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.829
 helped for the engines to work 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.760
 so on my test bench so I 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.739
 to connect a dad motor here is this 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.630
 that one must also know is that the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.709
 cnc china and that's signing a 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.160
 food 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.819
 so for this engine that I use here 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.160
 it is the file 12 volts in red in black 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.040
 we can go on the interface gerber 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.579
 controller the engine in question were 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.630
 plugged into the x controller if i 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:02.120
 click on x we ​​will see that there is a 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.410
 error n of fign fidh ride so what 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.750
 I found that it needed a 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.850
 sure value z so that the engine can 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.609
 to be used then on x that's it 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.420
 I update to position we see that the 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.889
 state aids 1 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.010
 so if now I leave the value 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.260
 paa 1 and I click on the arrow 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.829
 that goes right that fits a 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.230
 positive displacement of x we ​​observe that 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.150
 the engine is a little over a lap 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.709
 complete so here we can choose a fish 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.389
 outside and take a gerber file 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.609
 that here is one that was generated from a 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.000
 kick-ass project is projecting a 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.159
 programmer of spades canton louvre on 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.069
 sees the different displacements of the 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.189
 motor during the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.189
 life
