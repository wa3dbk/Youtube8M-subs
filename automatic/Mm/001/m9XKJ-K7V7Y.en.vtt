00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.889
 roundabouts or roundabouts are a good instrument for intersections 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.400
 be more fluid and safer and could be even more fluid and secure if 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.650
 the drivers circulate within them, always observing two rules 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.820
 drive in the right lane and respect the right of way 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.570
 circulation regulation defined a roundabout as a special type of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.440
 intersection characterized because the sections that converge in it communicate 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.310
 through a ring in which a rotating circulation is established 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.390
 around a central island i about the step preference says 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.780
 in the pipes 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.350
 those who are inside the circular path 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.850
 will have priority of passage over those who intend to access those 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.950
 regulation does not specify how to circulate inside a roundabout 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.750
 exactly the same way as on any road with more than one lane 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.089
 for each direction suppose that two vehicles 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.290
 they travel on a two-lane road in each direction 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.930
 who circulates in the left lane can not be changed to the right if there is another 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.680
 vehicle that already circulates through it 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.330
 to leave the main road for an exit to the right 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 you have to drive in the right lane 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.960
 who circulates in the left lane can not leave the main road in 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.950
 no case 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.210
 especially if another vehicle circulates on your right 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.390
 this is easy to understand on a straight road as well in a 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.860
 roundabout happens exactly the same is circulated on the right and the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.210
 main road from that lane 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.090
 this is the proper way to circulate in a gazebo and get out of it 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.720
 and this is the one that can cause problems if there are other vehicles 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.770
 you have to have something very present 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.110
 if you are driving in an inside lane 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.090
 who circulates on the right 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.370
 you do not have to leave the roundabout 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.240
 just like on a straight road 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.680
 lanes other than the one on the right should be used only for front 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.190
 ar 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.370
 like on a straight road 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.710
 This is explained to us by Lieutenant Vega PovÃ©s of the traffic group of the 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.459
 Civil Guard 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.609
 I can save the roundabout or square see this bullfighting must be done by the 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.470
 right lane percent 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.489
 2 3 look what was given 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 the situation is clarified 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.580
 and you should never decorate the roundabout from inside lane 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.349
 and if we do it again that the prosecutor does not have another bag of 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.059
 obstructing the vehicle that circulates in the right lane because it 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.339
 vehicles the one that has preference tells us hard by internal cable 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:44.879
 yes this vehicle 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.610
 safe in your right lane and you want from the left lane 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.899
 interior leaves the roundabout 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:56.079
 I can not do it by starring step d of the yellow vehicle therefore this 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.589
 vehicle should keep circling when hiring rent times as necessary 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.109
 until it does not invade 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.109
 and do not hinder the circulation of the other vehicle 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.679
 theoretically 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.949
 you do not have to turn on the turn signal if you are not going to change lanes 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.099
 in practice, it is sometimes advisable to do so as a defensive driving measure 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.790
 I do not know correctly 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.490
 and I have to be afraid 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.459
 because circulating in the right lane 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.919
 percent to be subject to a collision by the vehicle circulating the 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.159
 internal lane by caresses 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.399
 worked the curious who circulated correctly 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.949
 you have to put your left flashing because you do not trust the 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:36.899
 vehicle this one 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:41.109
 of the maneuver of doing efe is curious that it is from home whoever it is 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.759
 conveniently the maneuver itself at the roundabout the vehicle died but 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.960
 he has to do it because 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.540
 It is part of warrior to give the stained glass betting on an agent 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.369
 by percent incoherence of the purple vehicle 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.990
 the comments more about loritas 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.439
 apart from what we have commented 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.169
 provided it is not necessary to stop the car before entering the roundabout 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.259
 it is best to go in a short gear 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.979
 to be able to accelerate quickly when necessary 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.259
 as a rule 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.259
 the second speed is better 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.379
 if we are not sure which exit we should take in the roundabout 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.389
 it is best to enter 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.710
 and directly give all the turns that are necessary until we see what 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.310
 exit is the one that we should take
