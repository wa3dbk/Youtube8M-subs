00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:18.500
 Is a good friend Kyoko of antique &amp; Cloud today 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.500
 We introduce how to knit two or more button holes using crochet today 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:34.570
 And that this method will make eyes of edge and humor eyes look great the same 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:40.930
 Then it features that it is a durable buttonhole because both sides are made robust 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:43.320
 Take a look because making second method using the Crochet is Yes to introduce in episode 2 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:52.220
 Please give me 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.220
 Yes, I 've knitted the next four girls to the point of making a buttonhole for the fourth eye 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 First 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.280
 Bring the thread to you 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.640
 next 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.390
 To the right of the needle very first eye to the left of the needle 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.390
 I'm interested 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.720
 And bring the thread back to its original position again 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:27.940
 And also catching the eye in the needle on the left 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:31.720
 The eyes were the first to slip name the most from the sliding eye to the right of the needle 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.000
 I will look down on this woman 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.920
 I lie down one eye 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.950
 In the same way 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.500
 Have a slippery eye 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.500
 We lie down this two people before to cormorant 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.320
 Third daughter 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.770
 Blind eye 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.820
 The last four girls 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.820
 I look down 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 At this time the intention has always been behind like this 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:12.190
 this 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:16.800
 Back to the original slip eyes and the eyes to the right of the needle to the left eye 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.800
 And it's back like this 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.310
 This is the back side First we bring the thread back 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:42.160
 Then crochet the first two eyes on the left needle 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.470
 Plug in and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.470
 Pull the thread this way 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.390
 Then the rotten eye 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.390
 Make at a glance 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.630
 This crocodile is not counted in the number but the position of the yarn is changed by doing this 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:13.480
 It becomes easy to do 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:16.110
 This will make a make-up eye with a crochet . Bring the yarn back again 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.110
 The second 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.290
 We will knit 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.210
 Also bring it back and bring it back third 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 And make the last of the fourth woman 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.490
 This is the chain eyes do not count 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.860
 After this Kate holds behind the needle and does not speak as it is 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:51.500
 This loop 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.500
 You about to in this way to the needle 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.060
 I will return to the table again after this 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.920
 This left is also at the left end 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.080
 This loop the very first eye from slipping eyes to the right of the needle 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.549
 I will call 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:21.079
 Please be aware to pull this at a nice little 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.050
 Please be careful as it becomes too hard if it is too tight 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.110
 Then this woman 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.689
 Return to the left of the needle 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:36.999
 I entered the name of the above and put the four names up like this. 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.999
 So please knit as usual 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.389
