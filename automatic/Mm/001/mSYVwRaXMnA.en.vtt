 the presence of different doctors 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.550

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.200
 related skin care 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.670
 we found the so-called 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:24.579
 dermatologists this is health in sonsÃ³n de 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:26.230
 news dermatology is the 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.060
 medical specialty responsible for 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.460
 study of the structure and function of

 diagnosis and treatment to the skin is 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.530
 the largest organ in the body 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.699
 approximately it is repeated that it has a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.039
 extension of 1.27 meters which 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.390
 constitutes the most important organ 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.820
 I think you should consult where the 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.589
 doctor when he really is 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.690
 some abnormality in the skin which the 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.059
 patient has never had during all 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.410
 your life the appearance of a stain can 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.780
 generates the appearance of a skin cancer 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.039
 or the appearance of another type of injury 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.220
 located in other parts of the body 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.230
 be secondary 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.790
 have done for example the hair 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.890
 and other types of pathologies that can 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.300
 reflect another underlying disease within 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.030
 of skin diseases more 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.250
 common are dermatitis 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.260
 infections caused by fungal acne 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.270
 he repeats them more and me melanomas 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.370
 these last two are the ways of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 skin cancer one the most pathologies 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.090
 frequent in the dermatological consultation 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.530
 on the part of young people is acne in 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.210
 women of the adult stage 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.880
 melasma which are the spots that appear 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.450
 secondary to the sun however I think 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.250
 that the most important thing is to have a good 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.960
 education for the patient to avoid 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.640
 the appearance of malignant lesions like 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.290
 are all types of skin cancer 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.820
 that appear over time so 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.700
 people usually consult the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.690
 dermatologist when you have diseases 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.000
 already 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.530
 over diagnosed or when they consult 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.790
 multiple times to the general practitioner and in 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.560
 which has not had a good response 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.990
 clinic treatment formulated by them 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 consultations with the dermatologist provide 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.010
 patient education about 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.340
 normal skin care photoprotection 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.630
 advice on products for routine use 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.370
 cancer prevention surveillance 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.500
 risk factors for development of 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.510
 cutaneous diseases and treatment 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.670
 skin diseases when one 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.340
 shows skin manifestations what 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.290
 ideal is to go to the dermatologist once 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.990
 per year with the objective of evaluating the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.870
 skin or recommend a good factor 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.790
 anti sun protection which will 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.260
 avoid photoaging and at the same time 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.970
 time will prevent the appearance of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.620
 malignant lesions such as cancer of 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.900
 skin when the patient has 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.880
 history of malignant lesions that already 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.050
 has been operated in the case of 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.700
 basal cell carcinomas and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.230
 spinocellular control must be done 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.900
 every three months during the first year 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.360
 then every six months during the two 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.430
 following years and finally every year 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.720
 for three years until adjusting five 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.850
 years without skin lesions 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.770
 when it comes to being alert to the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.350
 possible appearance of skin cancer the 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.130
