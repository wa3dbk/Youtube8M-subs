00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.710
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.320
 Here I bring you another video this time 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.059
 to see a little tutorial about a 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.559
 new object that has been added in the 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.140
 version 173 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.760
 this element is the scissors and good 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.160
 As you can see we need two ingots of 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.750
 iron to create them and good commented 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.300
 a couple of things that have changed in 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.090
 minecraft in this one version is that the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.860
 When they are beaten, they no longer give wool and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.500
 we can only get the wool with this 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.540
 type of scissors and good in addition to this 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.149
 It is also very important as these 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.770
 scissors serve to pick us up 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.360
 leaves of trees before 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.370
 let's destroy in this way and we could not 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.860
 get nothing but with scissors 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.570
 we can pick the blocks of leaves is 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.800
 very interesting since with the blocks 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.090
 of leaves we can make elements 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.340
 decorative 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.680
 I would say and the first decorative element 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.989
 what has occurred to me is with a small 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.120
 fence and with this element of leaves 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.280
 we can make mini decorative saplings 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.960
 for our houses and it's really 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.579
 interesting and it will be very well I hope 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.439
 that you try it and you will see how it is going to 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.630
 like and well tell you about the 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.479
 sheep also now hitting them we do not 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.310
 they are going to give wool in agreement we will need 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.420
 scissors and giving the trigger 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.340
 left over 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.979
 the sheep can climb it and get 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.570
 the wool as you see and good is one thing 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.220
 quite important since the wool already 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.320
 you know we use it for beds 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.360
 and good pixelar decorative elements 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.950
 so now we'll have to pick it up 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.039
 with these sheep scissors and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.500
 you know and good to be careful with hitting 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.360
 to the sheep do not forget you have 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.030
 changed this method and we need the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.799
 scissors so good just you 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.479
 I wanted to bring these performances more 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.220
 basic scissors so you know 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.039
 that this new element is already in 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.690
 march on the 173 in the version so 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.640
 Well, I just hope that I have 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.740
 I liked this tutorial and it will serve you 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.149
 utility and good to share it with 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.979
 your friends so they can see the 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.840
 operation of scissors and 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.060
 just give it like if you liked the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.130

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.009
