00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.319 
and and as I began to sort of drawn out
you<00:02:12.130> know<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.280> realized<00:02:12.640> he<00:02:12.819> had<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.030> be<00:02:13.120> very

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
you know I realized he had to be very

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.720 
you know I realized he had to be very
very<00:02:13.900> thin<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.590> know<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.190> had<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.370> be<00:02:15.489> able<00:02:15.579> to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
very thin you know I had to be able to

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.490 
very thin you know I had to be able to
move<00:02:16.090> him<00:02:16.239> around<00:02:16.390> across<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> screen<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.440> I

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
move him around across the screen so I

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.890 
move him around across the screen so I
thought<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:18.130> lot<00:02:18.549> about<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.030> know<00:02:19.150> guys<00:02:19.870> like

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
thought a lot about you know guys like

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.729 
thought a lot about you know guys like
Usher<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.799> Michael<00:02:21.400> Jackson<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.440> know

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
Usher and Michael Jackson and you know

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.680 
Usher and Michael Jackson and you know
what<00:02:24.069> would<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.639> know<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.910> title<00:02:25.090> moves<00:02:25.450> they

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
what would you know the title moves they

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.930 
what would you know the title moves they
would<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:26.109> you<00:02:27.069> know<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.400> they<00:02:27.519> were<00:02:27.639> sort<00:02:27.880> of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
would have you know as they were sort of

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.420 
would have you know as they were sort of
skirt<00:02:28.239> across<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.720> screen<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.620> all<00:02:30.069> those

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
skirt across the screen so all those

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.890 
skirt across the screen so all those
sort<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.760> things<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:31.420> kind<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.660> didn't

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
sort of things I kind of didn't

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.449 
sort of things I kind of didn't
consideration<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.709> terms<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:33.010> really<00:02:33.220> trying

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
consideration in terms of really trying

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.330 
consideration in terms of really trying
to<00:02:33.670> crack<00:02:34.239> take<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.780> classic<00:02:35.350> Disney<00:02:35.920> character

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
to crack take a classic Disney character

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.460 
to crack take a classic Disney character
and<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.489> think<00:02:36.700> as<00:02:36.850> as<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.930> watch<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.440> film

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
and I think as as you watch the film

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.500 
and I think as as you watch the film
hopefully<00:02:39.190> you'll<00:02:40.000> think<00:02:40.060> about<00:02:40.359> those

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
hopefully you'll think about those

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.960 
hopefully you'll think about those
things<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.810> said<00:02:40.989> okay<00:02:41.319> that's<00:02:41.530> sort<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.889> like

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.490 

this<00:02:45.970> sort<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.209> like<00:02:46.389> the<00:02:46.569> roughest<00:02:47.019> version

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
this sort of like the roughest version

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.900 
this sort of like the roughest version
but<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:47.859> in<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.100> film<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.519> know<00:02:48.549> when<00:02:48.819> he

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
but like in the film you know when he

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.430 
but like in the film you know when he
sort<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.180> introduces<00:02:49.660> mama<00:02:49.900> for<00:02:50.139> the<00:02:50.230> first

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
sort of introduces mama for the first

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.670 
sort of introduces mama for the first
time<00:02:51.600> hopefully<00:02:52.600> you'll<00:02:52.989> see<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
time hopefully you'll see the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.080 
time hopefully you'll see the
resemblance<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.459> hopefully<00:02:54.850> you'll<00:02:55.000> enjoy
