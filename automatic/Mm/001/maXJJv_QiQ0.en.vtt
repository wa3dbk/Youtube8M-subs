00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.120
 hi friends and welcome to a 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.610
 easy pull piano video point fr 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.890
 this video is a complement of the pack 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.960
 beginners so to be able to appreciate it 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.090
 you have to do the beginners pack and ben 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.420
 it's gone to work the continuation of 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.420
 Libya 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.970
 at the previous session we saw how 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.490
 work the agreements so the following 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 of agreements fits here and we saw the 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.760
 rhythmic that had to be done 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.080
 register here down now we all 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.480
 we will try to do this together 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.720
 be careful what you absolutely need to do 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 it's rhythmically rigorous no 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.070
 whites between chords we do not 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.390
 of expectations between agreements we will 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 try to chain 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.239
 if there is a choice to make it is better 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.550
 to choose the chu rhythm but I 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.840
 cheat me from time to time okay 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.820
 rather than I try to always do 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.420
 well the agreements but with three 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.700
 seconds late 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 because when would want to do them in 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.430
 rhythm you're wrong so that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.470
 it's useless to wait for them to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.090
 100% agreements well to place a 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.660
 rhythm i tell you papara to do 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.290
 whatever 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.220
 it's just that you do not have to wait for 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.050
 know it 100% 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.520
 if you do not know too much about water 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.080
 major not too bad only last major finally 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.330
 the four agreements not too bad you 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.910
 deceive one time out of four is fine 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.110
 the pace is the weeks of 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.700
 work that will do that you will you 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.420
 deceive less and less from the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.490
 moment it's in rhythm it's essential 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.020
 I'll play it and I'll take it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 say at the same time so we'll do the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.800
 couple is with the rhythm count in cat 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.069
 I will start by saying two three 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:49.590
 four and here we go 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.020
 4 1 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:04.049
 troy cate is a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:07.079
 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.569
 cannes of course to do in loop the 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:19.530
 chorus it'll give this we start 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:20.620
 by the minor 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:33.879
 2 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:35.470
 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.569
 3 4 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.000
 eva this is it applied to the verses and 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.950
 refrains the idea of ​​doing verse couplet 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.620
 chorus verse couplet chorus and that's 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.150
 to try to chain the piece eh 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.769
 Well, we've seen everything we need to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.400
 work the tit b now it's up to 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.400
