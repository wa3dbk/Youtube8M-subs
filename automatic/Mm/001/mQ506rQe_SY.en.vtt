00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:04.210
 good morning, good afternoon, good evening 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.430
 we are here again 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.959
 with one more chat in the net about 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.959
 the interpretation of modern fashion trends 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:13.859
 Image 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.689
 I chose 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.470
 this piece 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.279
 it's not a shorts it's not a sect 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.339
 it's a pants skirt 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.439
 much used in the 80's that is returning already had a slight 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.410
 Éverton sena are passed on to the owner teresinha a weapon 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.990
 the score 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.990
 because this trend story is as follows 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.480
 that's where it's inserted 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 in fashion shows 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.999
 why the first 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.470
 Deise appeared Aquino is just a little 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.930
 It's not everyone who does what you do 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.870
 will you reach the side 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.560
 to the point where 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.450
 who have also seen each other since they tend to 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.170
 do 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.710
 a part of the station 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.329
 rafael negrão 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.439
 now from 2002 and it is not for us that either now happens on the date 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.180
 it's like a peek 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.460
 and does not mark not only how to contest the cute ones and why do we line up 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.290
 is accompanying the decade to some seasons will be quite a long time 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.330
 and this is a characteristic of the 80's 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
 the day in cds did everything dynamically 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 now 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.550
 the house is the cause is a comfortable piece 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.300
 she has a slightly larger hook 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.850
 But do not worry, I'll let you go. 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.729
 to really give that comfort and stay in the middle is not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.470
 Look how she did it. 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.429
 I'm taking it, he was a resident of the year, normally she's not short, she's 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.490
 the long like that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.239
 Ines is that neither magic Nelson a washed 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 the court magistrate school 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.079
 the finishes here 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.129
 is that he rendered everything else very simple 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.359
 Brazilian fashion is not Ana 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.359
 brasília 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.159
 is much richer in duke details and 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.659
 we come from europe in europe and the americas to anticipate one day this 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.529
 a little more 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.909
 is 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.039
 when we talk about 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.039
 this firefox faial island out of the traditional 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:56.449
 the in the brazil at least the 80's were made and five wonderful pieces pine 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:57.739
 dinis 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.239
 I believe we now have this opportunity again. 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.930
 on sale 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.289
 looks 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.479
 those breaks a pretty basic person 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.929
 this combination 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.560
 due to persistent 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.049
 is another trend 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.939
 can be shirt with pants in shorts but the two pieces made in day in which 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.939
 if 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.989
 can be used to treat the cause is not the beach 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.519
 roberto arruda 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.699
 here was used one day that little heavier for the two for parts 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:46.400
 and you come here to modeling a well focused makeup and well structured 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.689
 a house already the most expensive and one way 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.829
 the network is even years 87 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.509
 now in the next 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:02.069
 here we see the detail in mission of the home pocket 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.610
 is all that if you want our student who acquired modeling course 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.849
 intended industrial 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.489
 and even in you tube and that sequence of helton bermuda teaching the 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.449
 do sit down 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.989
 ef 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.570
 we put up a demand for this clown not a shorts 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.139
 who 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.460
 the form of assembly is practically 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.520
 similar 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.000
 but the modeling of the skirt pants she has 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.739
 how many are so extremely important to really be a skirt 

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:39.520
 trousers 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.540
 she does not bother me at all 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.540
 she has a goose differentiate 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.159

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.020
 abroad 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.599
 a trend that years will 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.640
 and that this happens on the date 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.840
 will remain 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.900
 this person will actually get a record in the examples 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.379
 if it will be well accepted 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:11.529
 in the 80's we did it and learn to give it to her she was really leaving it's 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.089
 an extremely comfortable piece 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.779
 Give it to you there to work. 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.379
 What is different from the strong and shorts 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.040
 she is more behaved in step 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.449
 who enters well in various places 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.759
