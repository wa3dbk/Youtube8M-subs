doesn't<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.739> fancy<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:36.360> works

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
doesn't have to be fancy and it works

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.730 
doesn't have to be fancy and it works
very<00:00:37.110> very<00:00:37.290> well<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> chain<00:00:39.900> eyes<00:00:40.110> work<00:00:40.410> great

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
very very well the chain eyes work great

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.510 
very very well the chain eyes work great
in<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.100> area<00:00:42.080> it's<00:00:43.080> fairly<00:00:43.380> shallow<00:00:43.740> so<00:00:44.400> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
in this area it's fairly shallow so the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.450 
in this area it's fairly shallow so the
fly<00:00:44.730> doesn't<00:00:45.000> sing<00:00:45.360> quite<00:00:45.630> as<00:00:45.810> fast<00:00:46.080> and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
fly doesn't sing quite as fast and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.860 
fly doesn't sing quite as fast and
that's<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.610> I'd<00:00:47.730> recommend<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.660> if

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that's what I'd recommend for here if

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
that's what I'd recommend for here if
you're<00:00:49.560> fishing<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.040> wrap<00:00:50.220> like<00:00:50.490> I<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.700> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you're fishing a wrap like I do on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.930 
you're fishing a wrap like I do on
occasion<00:00:51.150> for<00:00:51.660> smallmouth<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.890> better<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
occasion for smallmouth it's better to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
occasion for smallmouth it's better to
use<00:00:53.970> lead<00:00:54.780> eyes<00:00:54.990> that'll<00:00:55.740> get<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.950> down<00:00:56.220> faster

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
use lead eyes that'll get it down faster

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.990 
use lead eyes that'll get it down faster
and<00:00:57.650> also<00:00:58.650> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> give<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.310> a<00:00:59.370> try<00:00:59.580> on<00:00:59.610> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and also going to give it a try on the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.050 
and also going to give it a try on the
James<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.630> next<00:01:00.870> season<00:01:01.110> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:02.060> well

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060

kind of slippery once in a while just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.410 
kind of slippery once in a while just
tie<00:01:36.860> them<00:01:37.040> in<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> figure<00:01:37.700> it'll<00:01:38.000> help<00:01:38.180> hold

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
tie them in a figure it'll help hold

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.300 
tie them in a figure it'll help hold
them<00:01:38.570> down<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.530> can<00:01:39.649> put<00:01:39.829> a<00:01:39.860> little<00:01:39.979> glue<00:01:40.280> on

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.580 
them down you can put a little glue on
it<00:01:40.549> now<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.060> want<00:01:41.180> but<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:41.899> like<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.290> wait

till the end and put the glue on then

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.940 
till the end and put the glue on then
then<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.610> doesn't<00:01:46.909> get<00:01:47.030> all<00:01:47.090> messy<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.990> then

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
then it doesn't get all messy and then

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.760 
then it doesn't get all messy and then
wrap<00:01:49.310> down<00:01:49.579> to<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.180> just<00:01:50.990> past<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.380> point<00:01:51.590> of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
of a slim fly here we don't want a whole

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.009 
of a slim fly here we don't want a whole
lot<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.709> bulk<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:11.450> seems<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.780> work

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
lot of bulk to it it seems to work

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.990 
lot of bulk to it it seems to work
better<00:02:12.290> when<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.980> little<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.640> slim

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
better when it's a little on the slim

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.229 
better when it's a little on the slim
side<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.440> less<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.100> more<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.519> this<00:02:16.640> case

ty you in a few strands of that and add

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.149 
ty you in a few strands of that and add
that<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.489> tail<00:02:36.879> section<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:40.920> tie<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:41.980> in

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
that to the tail section and tie it in

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.500

with a few tight wraps and for the body
I<00:02:46.659> use<00:02:46.840> s<00:02:47.319> des<00:02:47.639> so<00:02:48.639> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:49.000> use<00:02:49.150> small<00:02:49.569> or

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
I use s des so you can use small or

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.589 
I use s des so you can use small or
medium<00:02:50.609> clean<00:02:51.609> off<00:02:51.760> some<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.299> trash

medium clean off some of the trash
around<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.170> end<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.650> get<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> core<00:02:54.310> L<00:02:54.609> so

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
around the end so you get the core L so

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.740 
around the end so you get the core L so
you<00:02:54.879> have<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> good<00:02:55.420> place<00:02:55.689> to<00:02:55.930> tie<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:58.599> then

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
you have a good place to tie to and then

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.099 
you have a good place to tie to and then
tie<00:02:59.379> that<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.889> nice<00:03:00.189> and<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.269> wrap<00:03:01.780> toward
