00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.520
 plagues and diseases are common problems 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.110
 all cultures 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.060
 the melon also needs care 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.510
 phytosanitary diseases such as cancer of the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.000
 humid oÃ­dium and the mosaic of the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.699
 watermelons are constant threats at least 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.309
 a child in the same way and certain how 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.489
 the larva minadora the aphids the kitties 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.070
 the drill of the cucurbitaceae the fly 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.590
 fruit and the mite require attention from the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.360
 farmer in your control 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.630
 combat any of these pests 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.550
 disease can be preventative curative in 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.829
 two cases there are rules that need to 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.540
 be followed with discipline so that the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.610
 positive results are obtained. 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.010
 soil preparation with deep action and 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.320
 sun exposure reduces the population of 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.309
 pathogens than soil pests and herbs 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.039
 weed 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.680
 that is, the better the preparation 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.880
 the greater the possibility of success 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.380
 of culture over time 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.450
 the donation must follow the recommendation 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.300
 appropriate technique for plants to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.270
 healthy and therefore more resistant 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.670
 due to their better nutrition should be 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.890
 resistant varieties are used whenever 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.080
 especially in regions where 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.330
 pathogens have greater potential for 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.130
 proliferation 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.259
 the seed should be purchased next to 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.910
 suitable suppliers because they are 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.090
 ensures its genetic quality and 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.130
 plant crop rotation 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.619
 should be common practice in avoiding 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.789
 disease and plant pests 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.349
 elimination of diseased plants 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.810
 other fruits of maize and cultural remains 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:56.950
 practices that help prevent 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.560
 the presence of sources of innovation 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.869
 The proper management of the excess water without 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.910
 and avoids the formation of a 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.569
 microclimate favorable to the appearance of 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.569
 pests and diseases 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.250
 Weed control also 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.290
 Avoid sources of sunglasses 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.980
 competition, facilitating the development of 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.069
 of the millennium as plants by day and by 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.560
 the use of pesticides must be done under 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.030
 rigid control because the excesses may 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.950
 in a short time 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.950
 be detrimental to one's culture 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.170
 the use of chemical pesticides depends on 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.459
 a series of essential care 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.390
 first know if the product is 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.350
 recommended 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.180
 then to register for the crop 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.030
 the application must be made strictly 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.770
 arranged in conditions where the labels 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.610
 dosage is specified. 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.250
 hectare 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.550
 the regulation of the ratio and the proper nozzles 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.739
 no sprayer and more care is needed 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.290
 with wind at the times of application that 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.239
 cause product losses due to 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.850
 you should avoid the hottest times 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.709
 for application in relation to the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.930
 time of application the melon has a 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.980
 factor that needs to be taken 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.530
 in consideration 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.200
 avoid spraying in the morning 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.150
 the flowering period so that there is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.769
 interference with insect activity 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.050
 pollinators 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.540
 with respect to safety is fundamental 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.350
 use of protective equipment such as 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.310
 masks gloves and overalls and for 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.190
 close the subject 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.980
 remember the recommendation of pesticides 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.989
 is attributed by the agronomist to 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 presence of a technician trained in the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.340
 area for the diagnosis and supervision of 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.610
 pest disease control is very 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.610
 important
