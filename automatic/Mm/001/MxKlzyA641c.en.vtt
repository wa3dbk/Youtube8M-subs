00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.530 

those<00:02:19.160> guys<00:02:19.400> who<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.849> see<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.239> map<00:02:20.360> is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
those guys who can see on the map is

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.400 
those guys who can see on the map is
relatively<00:02:20.959> close<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> metro<00:02:21.800> station

relatively close to the metro station

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.839 
relatively close to the metro station
once<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.560> select<00:02:24.860> them<00:02:25.010> at<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.190> scanner<00:02:25.459> fly

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
once you select them at the scanner fly

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:36.110 
once you select them at the scanner fly
over<00:02:26.150> there

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.089 

that's<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.989> metro<00:02:37.290> station<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:37.890> flew

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
that's the metro station I just flew

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.899 
that's the metro station I just flew
over<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.519> ground<00:02:41.730> there

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
over and to see on the ground there

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.880 
over and to see on the ground there
sometimes<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.690> marker<00:02:43.080> isn't<00:02:43.379> exactly<00:02:43.799> on

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
sometimes that marker isn't exactly on

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.130 
sometimes that marker isn't exactly on
top<00:02:44.220> before<00:02:44.370> you're<00:02:44.700> looking<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.480> fire

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
top before you're looking for that fire

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.869 
top before you're looking for that fire
hydrant<00:02:46.319> shooting<00:02:46.830> water<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> left<00:02:47.610> is

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
hydrant shooting water to the left is

00:02:47.879 --> 00:03:01.020 
hydrant shooting water to the left is
where<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.599> citizen<00:02:49.019> is

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.540 

so<00:03:01.660> Superman<00:03:02.170> once<00:03:02.410> again<00:03:02.620> can<00:03:02.800> save<00:03:03.040> him<00:03:03.250> use

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
so Superman once again can save him use

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.040 
so Superman once again can save him use
her<00:03:03.760> ice<00:03:04.000> breath<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.510> freeze<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.020> water

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
her ice breath to freeze the water

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:23.030 
her ice breath to freeze the water
coming<00:03:05.440> out<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.770> fire<00:03:05.950> hydrant

while we're waiting you may have noticed
this<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.900> little<00:03:25.049> bit<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.379> a<00:03:25.439> delay<00:03:25.709> between

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
this a little bit of a delay between

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.979 
this a little bit of a delay between
each<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.459> these<00:03:26.579> citizens<00:03:26.909> it's<00:03:27.569> because<00:03:27.840> it

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
each of these citizens it's because it

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.209 
each of these citizens it's because it
takes<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.290> while<00:03:28.439> to<00:03:28.620> bring<00:03:28.769> up<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.010> map<00:03:29.189> you

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:29.219 
takes a while to bring up the map you

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:44.580 
takes a while to bring up the map you
have<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.609> wait<00:03:29.730> for<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:29.939> autosave<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.689> go<00:03:30.780> off

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.830 

now<00:03:45.190> before<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.550> go<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.819> this<00:03:46.000> next<00:03:46.300> citizen<00:03:46.599> I'm

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
now before I go to this next citizen I'm

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.660 
now before I go to this next citizen I'm
going<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.050> get<00:03:47.140> another<00:03:47.319> character<00:03:47.860> these

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
going to get another character these

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.759 
going to get another character these
Riddler<00:03:49.060> goons<00:03:49.330> were<00:03:49.540> attacking<00:03:49.870> me<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.319> so<00:03:50.739> I

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
Riddler goons were attacking me and so I

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.990 
Riddler goons were attacking me and so I
happen<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.250> purchase<00:03:51.940> him<00:03:52.120> here<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.730> the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
it was a plant but neither of those work

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.160 
it was a plant but neither of those work
you<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.360> need<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.660> take<00:04:35.780> somebody<00:04:36.020> like

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
plant with the ranged weapon that will

00:04:41.480 --> 00:05:11.210 
plant with the ranged weapon that will
spit<00:04:41.810> out<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.110> citizen

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220
