00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.890
 from brandenburger tor because we are against 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.930
 speculation with food 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 demonstrate share of their 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 income gives people in others 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 countries 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 foods are enough for that reason 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 even small price fluctuations that themselves 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.420
 the perpetrators are despotic 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.430
 services in search of always 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.170
 new ways to win are the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.910
 Meanwhile, financial markets are also massively in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.980
 the raw material markets 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 more and more banks and insurance companies 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.830
 bet on the price trend of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.420
 food 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.100
 if so many would have it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 the prices rise then they do that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.550
 actually that too makes you hungry when 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.550
 sugar on 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.950
 starving in a rich world 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.330
 currently about 870 million people 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.980
 that's a huge scandal 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.930
 That is almost every eighth person on 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.240
 this planet we are with today 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.640
 Hundreds of people in common before the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.620
 Federal Chancellery around here the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.970
 to call on the federal government 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.710
 finally use the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 speculation with food too 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.070
 stop there is just on eu level 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.420
 process where the federal government 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 to use for it 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.480
 Of course it comes on the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.190
 individual financial actors 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.900
 These are not allowed to wait that long 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.400
 finally , she gives brittish regulations 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.960
 So everyone has to leave the business 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.459
 withdraw with hunger and that is 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.580
 in Germany, especially the German 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:27.930
 bank and the alliance currently lively with 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:29.280
 basic foods to 100 of these 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.990
 Autumn is the best chance 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.880
 speculation with food finally 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.830
 Next we will finish the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.260
 100,000 signatures to Mr. SchÃ¤uble 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.180
 hand him over and ask him in 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.560
 brussels against speculation with 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.560
 to use foods
