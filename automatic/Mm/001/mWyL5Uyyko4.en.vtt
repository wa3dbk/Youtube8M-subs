case<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:47.080> would<00:01:47.170> be<00:01:47.260> 20<00:01:47.560> 124<00:01:48.490> calories<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
case it would be 20 124 calories so the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.230 
case it would be 20 124 calories so the
next<00:01:50.740> thing<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.070> do<00:01:51.189> is<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.400> add<00:01:51.549> your<00:01:51.820> average

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
next thing you do is we add your average

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.210 
next thing you do is we add your average
daily<00:01:52.479> exercise<00:01:53.049> calorie<00:01:53.439> burn<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:54.010> this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
daily exercise calorie burn to this

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.950 
daily exercise calorie burn to this
number<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:55.000> find<00:01:55.240> out<00:01:55.390> what<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.689> would<00:01:55.840> need

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
number to find out what you would need

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.870 
number to find out what you would need
to<00:01:56.140> eat<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.530> maintain<00:01:56.710> your<00:01:56.979> weight<00:01:57.159> with<00:01:57.610> your

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
to eat to maintain your weight with your

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.870 
to eat to maintain your weight with your
workouts<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:59.049> if<00:01:59.170> i<00:01:59.259> was<00:01:59.380> doing<00:01:59.619> p90x<00:02:00.100> burning

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
workouts so if i was doing p90x burning

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.640 
workouts so if i was doing p90x burning
an<00:02:00.970> average<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.330> 400<00:02:01.810> calories<00:02:02.170> per<00:02:02.320> day<00:02:02.350> with

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
an average of 400 calories per day with

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.530 
an average of 400 calories per day with
my<00:02:02.799> workouts<00:02:03.220> then<00:02:03.700> i<00:02:03.790> would<00:02:03.820> need<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.210> consume

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
my workouts then i would need to consume

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.509 
my workouts then i would need to consume
20<00:02:05.040> 524<00:02:06.040> calories<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.759> maintain<00:02:06.790> my<00:02:07.299> way<00:02:08.519> the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
20 524 calories to maintain my way the

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.360 
20 524 calories to maintain my way the
next<00:02:09.819> thing<00:02:09.939> you<00:02:10.060> need<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.239> do<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.629> calculate

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
next thing you need to do is calculate

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.220 
next thing you need to do is calculate
your<00:02:12.370> calorie<00:02:12.999> deficit<00:02:13.450> if<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.689> want<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.019> lose

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
your calorie deficit if you want to lose

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.590 
your calorie deficit if you want to lose
weight

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
weight

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.740 
weight
so<00:02:15.290> if<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.860> choose<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> 500<00:02:16.940> calorie<00:02:17.270> deficit

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
so if you choose a 500 calorie deficit

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.510 
so if you choose a 500 calorie deficit
you'll<00:02:17.990> lose<00:02:18.230> approximately<00:02:18.470> one<00:02:19.040> pound<00:02:19.310> per

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
you'll lose approximately one pound per

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.060 
you'll lose approximately one pound per
week<00:02:19.730> because<00:02:19.970> there's<00:02:20.180> approximately<00:02:21.070> 3500

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
week because there's approximately 3500

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.200 
week because there's approximately 3500
calories<00:02:22.280> per<00:02:22.790> pound<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.360> fat<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.530> if<00:02:25.210> calorie

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
calories per pound of fat so if calorie

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.730 
calories per pound of fat so if calorie
deficit<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.870> help<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.110> lose<00:02:27.260> about<00:02:27.500> two

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
deficit will help you lose about two

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.100 
deficit will help you lose about two
pounds<00:02:27.920> per<00:02:28.220> week<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.240> subtract<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.990> amount

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
pounds per week so subtract the amount

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.810 
pounds per week so subtract the amount
that<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.500> want<00:02:30.740> for<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> deficit<00:02:31.490> from<00:02:31.610> your

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
that you want for a deficit from your

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.380 
that you want for a deficit from your
total<00:02:32.210> tdee<00:02:32.840> plus<00:02:33.350> exercises<00:02:33.950> calories<00:02:34.460> so<00:02:35.240> in

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
total tdee plus exercises calories so in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.330 
total tdee plus exercises calories so in
my<00:02:35.540> case<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:36.260> know<00:02:36.320> my<00:02:36.440> 25<00:02:36.890> hundred<00:02:37.220> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
my case you know my 25 hundred and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.090 
my case you know my 25 hundred and
twenty<00:02:37.670> four<00:02:37.910> calories<00:02:38.240> i<00:02:38.750> would<00:02:39.380> subtract<00:02:39.830> a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
twenty four calories i would subtract a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.250 
twenty four calories i would subtract a
number<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.820> get<00:02:40.970> my<00:02:41.090> calorie<00:02:41.420> deficit<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:42.050> my

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
number to get my calorie deficit in my

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.500 
number to get my calorie deficit in my
specific<00:02:42.770> example<00:02:43.250> i<00:02:43.430> went<00:02:43.610> with<00:02:43.700> an<00:02:43.850> 1800

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
specific example i went with an 1800

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.450 
specific example i went with an 1800
calorie<00:02:44.840> plan<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.440> lose<00:02:45.650> weight<00:02:45.920> with<00:02:46.130> p90x

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
calorie plan to lose weight with p90x

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.780 
calorie plan to lose weight with p90x
which<00:02:47.240> was<00:02:47.420> about<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.860> 724<00:02:48.860> calorie<00:02:49.310> deficit

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
which was about a 724 calorie deficit

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.050 
which was about a 724 calorie deficit
per<00:02:50.570> day<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.770> if<00:02:52.070> you're<00:02:52.250> looking<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> put<00:02:52.940> on

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
per day so if you're looking to put on

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.970 
per day so if you're looking to put on
muscle<00:02:53.330> mass<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.870> need<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.140> gain<00:02:54.410> weight<00:02:54.440> then

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
muscle mass and need to gain weight then

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.760 
muscle mass and need to gain weight then
you<00:02:55.130> actually<00:02:55.340> add<00:02:55.700> calories<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.350> to

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
you actually add calories to that to

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.460 
you actually add calories to that to
that<00:02:57.800> maintenance<00:02:58.460> number<00:02:59.080> and<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.200> wouldn't

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
that maintenance number and I wouldn't

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.410 
that maintenance number and I wouldn't
add<00:03:00.650> any<00:03:00.680> more<00:03:00.980> than<00:03:01.250> 500<00:03:01.760> calories<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.300> that

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
add any more than 500 calories to that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.480 
add any more than 500 calories to that
to<00:03:02.630> go<00:03:02.780> for<00:03:03.020> about<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.350> pound<00:03:03.680> per<00:03:04.010> week<00:03:04.190> gain

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
to go for about a pound per week gain

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.830 
to go for about a pound per week gain
anything<00:03:04.820> more<00:03:05.150> than<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.360> you'll<00:03:05.600> probably

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
anything more than that you'll probably

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.320 
anything more than that you'll probably
end<00:03:06.080> up<00:03:06.200> putting<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.590> some<00:03:06.830> additional<00:03:07.190> fat<00:03:07.400> so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
end up putting on some additional fat so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.810 
end up putting on some additional fat so
for<00:03:09.170> my<00:03:09.320> case<00:03:09.590> it's<00:03:09.890> about<00:03:10.870> 3024<00:03:11.870> calories<00:03:12.820> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
for my case it's about 3024 calories to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.650 
for my case it's about 3024 calories to
gain<00:03:14.450> muscle<00:03:14.600> mass<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:16.790> lot<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.120> people<00:03:17.210> will

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
gain muscle mass so a lot of people will

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.480 
gain muscle mass so a lot of people will
tend<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:17.990> lose<00:03:18.200> more<00:03:18.620> weight<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.070> first<00:03:19.280> few

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
tend to lose more weight the first few

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.400 
tend to lose more weight the first few
weeks<00:03:19.730> with<00:03:19.970> their<00:03:20.120> calorie<00:03:20.390> deficit<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.140> if

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
weeks with their calorie deficit so if

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.570 
weeks with their calorie deficit so if
you're<00:03:21.560> losing<00:03:21.890> more<00:03:22.040> than<00:03:22.100> one<00:03:22.430> or<00:03:22.550> two

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
you're losing more than one or two

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.000 
you're losing more than one or two
pounds<00:03:22.970> per<00:03:23.090> week<00:03:23.120> at<00:03:23.390> first<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:24.170> completely

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
pounds per week at first it's completely

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.040 
pounds per week at first it's completely
normal<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.520> actually<00:03:26.000> lost<00:03:26.300> quite<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.690> bit<00:03:26.780> at

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
normal I actually lost quite a bit at

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.330 
normal I actually lost quite a bit at
first<00:03:27.080> because<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.650> lose<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.890> lot<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.190> water

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
first because you lose a lot of water

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.330 
first because you lose a lot of water
weight<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.790> process<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.920> couple<00:03:31.100> things

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
weight in the process so a couple things

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.060 
weight in the process so a couple things
to<00:03:31.460> keep<00:03:31.550> in<00:03:31.790> mind<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.840> would<00:03:33.230> not<00:03:33.380> go<00:03:33.440> more<00:03:34.040> than

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
to keep in mind I would not go more than

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.520
