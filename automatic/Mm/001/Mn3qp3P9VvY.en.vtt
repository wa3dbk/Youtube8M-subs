but<00:03:44.340> more<00:03:45.330> likely<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.960> video<00:03:46.230> might<00:03:46.470> leak

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
but more likely the video might leak

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.290 
but more likely the video might leak
earlier<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:47.400> they'll<00:03:47.550> have<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.760> release<00:03:48.270> it

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
earlier so they'll have to release it

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.150 
earlier so they'll have to release it
earlier<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:48.930> who<00:03:49.470> knows<00:03:49.650> maybe<00:03:49.680> they'll<00:03:50.070> be

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
earlier but who knows maybe they'll be

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.010 
earlier but who knows maybe they'll be
able<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.430> hold<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.670> off<00:03:50.880> until<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.210> 26<00:03:51.780> but

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
able to hold it off until the 26 but

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.910
