note I do have to render the video so it

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.310 
note I do have to render the video so it
might<00:03:31.459> take<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.640> little<00:03:31.760> bit<00:03:31.880> longer<00:03:32.150> than<00:03:32.510> you

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
might take a little bit longer than you

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.170 
might take a little bit longer than you
know<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> second<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:34.670> third<00:03:34.850> job<00:03:35.060> work

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
know for a second and third job work

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.960 
know for a second and third job work
about<00:03:35.510> first<00:03:35.750> day<00:03:35.959> for<00:03:36.709> job<00:03:37.040> might<00:03:37.549> not<00:03:37.790> come

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
about first day for job might not come

out<00:03:38.090> on<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.239> first<00:03:38.420> stage<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:38.840> because

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
out on the first stage is because

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.370 
out on the first stage is because
rendering<00:03:39.680> takes<00:03:39.860> an<00:03:40.130> hour<00:03:40.400> or<00:03:40.730> two<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.380> forth

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
rendering takes an hour or two and forth

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.690 
rendering takes an hour or two and forth
job<00:03:42.680> will<00:03:43.190> probably<00:03:43.580> be<00:03:43.730> put<00:03:44.600> in<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:46.519> would

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
job will probably be put in it would

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.949 
job will probably be put in it would
just<00:03:46.820> take<00:03:46.910> time<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.239> time<00:03:47.420> because<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.780> have

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
just take time to time because I have

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.020 
just take time to time because I have
school<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.260> all<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:49.400> that's<00:03:49.820> high

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
school and all that so that's high
