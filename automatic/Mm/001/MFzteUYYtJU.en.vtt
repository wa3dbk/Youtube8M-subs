muffler that somebody from the forum

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.360 
muffler that somebody from the forum
gave<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.830> me<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.890> clamped<00:02:29.100> on

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
gave to me and just got it clamped on

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.750 
gave to me and just got it clamped on
there<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> did<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.180> make<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> sleeve<00:02:31.490> out<00:02:32.490> of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
there I did have to make a sleeve out of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.320 
there I did have to make a sleeve out of
just<00:02:32.970> some<00:02:33.060> HVAC<00:02:33.600> material<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:35.060> got<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.150> say

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
just some HVAC material and I got to say

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.760 
just some HVAC material and I got to say
it's<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.260> definitely<00:02:37.950> an<00:02:38.100> improvement<00:02:38.220> I

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
it's it's definitely an improvement I

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.229 
it's it's definitely an improvement I
supported<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.300> some<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.480> suggested<00:02:42.720> I

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
supported it as some of you suggested I

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.820 
supported it as some of you suggested I
opted<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.480> orientation<00:02:46.200> only<00:02:46.350> because

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
opted for this orientation only because

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.530 
opted for this orientation only because
the<00:02:47.069> outlet<00:02:47.459> was<00:02:47.580> here<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.940> didn't<00:02:48.239> want<00:02:48.420> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the outlet was here and I didn't want it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.990 
the outlet was here and I didn't want it
this<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.739> didn't<00:02:49.980> want<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.250> outlet<00:02:50.550> pointed<00:02:50.910> at

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
this I didn't want the outlet pointed at

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.259 
this I didn't want the outlet pointed at
me<00:02:52.070> but<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> gotta<00:02:53.340> say<00:02:54.200> just<00:02:55.200> notice<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:56.269> look

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
me but I gotta say just notice this look

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.990 
me but I gotta say just notice this look
at<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.450> crack<00:02:58.459> so<00:03:01.220> right<00:03:02.220> there<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:02.850> where

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
at that crack so right there right where

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.940 
at that crack so right there right where
it's<00:03:03.120> joined<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:05.130> won't<00:03:05.310> last<00:03:05.550> long

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it's joined so this this won't last long

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.310 
it's joined so this this won't last long
probably<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.160> too<00:03:08.340> heavy<00:03:08.930> maybe<00:03:09.930> just

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
probably just too heavy maybe just

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.970 
probably just too heavy maybe just
because<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.650> too<00:03:10.830> old<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:12.709> it's<00:03:13.709> not<00:03:13.860> going

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
because it's too old but it's not going

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.590 
because it's too old but it's not going
to<00:03:14.040> last

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
to last

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.120 
to last
so<00:03:15.600> I'll<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.200> guess<00:03:16.530> I'll<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.709> use<00:03:16.980> it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
so I'll just I guess I'll just use it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
so I'll just I guess I'll just use it
till<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.310> falls<00:03:17.489> off<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:17.850> I'll<00:03:17.940> put<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
till it falls off then I'll put the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.540 
till it falls off then I'll put the
pepper<00:03:18.330> pot<00:03:18.540> back<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:18.959> but<00:03:19.430> definitely<00:03:20.430> an

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
pepper pot back on but definitely an

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.390 
pepper pot back on but definitely an
improvement<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.920> recommended<00:03:22.920> if<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.130> if

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
improvement so recommended if you if

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.509 
improvement so recommended if you if
probably<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.980> muffler<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.310> was

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
probably the the muffler that was

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.069 
probably the the muffler that was
mentioned<00:03:26.910> earlier<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.329> forums<00:03:27.630> probably

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
mentioned earlier in the forums probably

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.770 
mentioned earlier in the forums probably
the<00:03:28.170> best<00:03:28.519> AMC<00:03:29.519> 1<00:03:29.730> or<00:03:29.880> AC<00:03:30.030> 1<00:03:30.299> or<00:03:30.420> something<00:03:30.660> like

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
the best AMC 1 or AC 1 or something like

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.039 
the best AMC 1 or AC 1 or something like
that

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.090 
that
the<00:03:31.739> allis-chalmers<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.890> probably<00:03:34.890> would<00:03:35.010> be

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
the allis-chalmers so probably would be

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.449 
the allis-chalmers so probably would be
best<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.370> do<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.850> orient<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:37.079> way

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
best to do that and orient it this way

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.060 
best to do that and orient it this way
anyway<00:03:38.459> enjoy
