00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.950 

and<00:04:36.550> then<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.120> always<00:04:37.360> want<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.750> do<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.680 
and then you always want to do the
bottom<00:04:38.290> lashes<00:04:38.440> if<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:38.830> have<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:40.450> shadow
