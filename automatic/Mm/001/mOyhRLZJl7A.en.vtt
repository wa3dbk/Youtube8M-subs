Stephan platform now you don't have to
use<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> set<00:00:23.550> platform<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:24.720> gonna<00:00:24.810> give

just about chest height then actually

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.850 
just about chest height then actually
hold<00:00:33.840> them<00:00:33.960> under<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.440> using<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.800> for

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
hold them under that and using that for

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
hold them under that and using that for
balance<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.880> well<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.390> basically<00:00:37.020> simply

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
balance as well as it basically simply

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990

grab<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> stay<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.219> myself<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.670> lactic

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
grab on to stay with myself has lactic

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.720 
grab on to stay with myself has lactic
acid<00:00:39.300> builds<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.280> threatens<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.370> drop<00:00:41.579> me

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
acid builds up it threatens to drop me

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.770 
acid builds up it threatens to drop me
so<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.899> gonna<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.590> grab<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> dumbbell

do a squat and then straight back into a
reverse<00:00:49.230> lunge<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
reverse lunge and then down with the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
reverse lunge and then down with the
squad<00:00:51.239> set<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.840> dumbbell<00:00:52.110> down<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:53.039> more

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
squad set that dumbbell down one more

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.580 
squad set that dumbbell down one more
SWAT<00:00:53.550> come<00:00:54.449> back<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> way<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.410> on

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
SWAT come back this way and then go on

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.220 
SWAT come back this way and then go on
the<00:00:55.710> other<00:00:55.860> side<00:00:56.390> repeating<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> until

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the other side repeating like that until

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.119 
the other side repeating like that until
basically<00:00:58.379> lactic<00:00:58.949> acid<00:00:59.280> shuts<00:01:00.239> me<00:01:00.359> down<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
basically lactic acid shuts me down so

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
basically lactic acid shuts me down so
give<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> quick<00:01:02.370> demo<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.379> you

unweighted for quads the glutes and you

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.410 
unweighted for quads the glutes and you
guys<00:03:12.220> tend<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.519> create<00:03:12.670> our<00:03:12.790> little<00:03:12.970> too<00:03:13.120> and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
guys tend to create our little too and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.000 
guys tend to create our little too and
so<00:03:13.599> did<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.379> have<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> equipment

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
so did you have the equipment

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.860 
so did you have the equipment
it<00:03:15.280> doesn't<00:03:15.579> give<00:03:15.670> us<00:03:15.700> much<00:03:15.790> racket<00:03:16.180> don't

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
it doesn't give us much racket don't

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.140 
it doesn't give us much racket don't
necessarily<00:03:17.409> need<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.859> rack<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.310> bar<00:03:18.489> if

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
necessarily need the rack in the bar if

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.399 
necessarily need the rack in the bar if
you<00:03:19.269> got<00:03:19.390> some<00:03:19.569> solid<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.989> can<00:03:20.140> hang<00:03:20.260> on<00:03:20.379> to

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
you got some solid you can hang on to

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.289 
you got some solid you can hang on to
even<00:03:21.340> something<00:03:21.609> as<00:03:21.760> simple<00:03:21.879> as<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> towel

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
even something as simple as the towel

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.699 
even something as simple as the towel
will<00:03:22.480> lift<00:03:22.629> around<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:23.049> pole<00:03:23.349> or<00:03:23.379> something

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
will lift around a pole or something

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.680 
will lift around a pole or something
like<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.829> that'll<00:03:24.700> work<00:03:24.760> just<00:03:24.819> fine

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
like that that'll work just fine

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.259 
like that that'll work just fine
basically<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.349> just<00:03:26.409> for<00:03:26.650> balance<00:03:26.769> anyways

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
basically it's just for balance anyways

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.430 
basically it's just for balance anyways
that<00:03:28.269> serves<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.629> huff<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.810> puff<00:03:29.019> it's<00:03:29.290> still

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
that serves to huff and puff it's still

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.949 
that serves to huff and puff it's still
trying<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.709> recover<00:03:29.829> from<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:30.190> set<00:03:30.549> but<00:03:31.359> as

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
trying to recover from that set but as

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.039 
trying to recover from that set but as
you<00:03:32.109> can<00:03:32.290> see<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:33.310> do<00:03:33.430> alternating<00:03:33.970> reps<00:03:34.299> of

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
you can see you do alternating reps of

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.170 
you can see you do alternating reps of
the<00:03:35.139> squats<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.889> reverse<00:03:36.129> lunge<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.000> very

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
