to be the tough battle with her period
of<00:02:10.820> being<00:02:11.330> really<00:02:11.930> down<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.290> dumps

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
of being really down in the dumps

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.190 
of being really down in the dumps
because<00:02:12.980> I'm<00:02:13.100> long<00:02:13.640> here<00:02:14.050> which<00:02:15.050> is

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
because I'm long here which is

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.930 
because I'm long here which is
understandable<00:02:15.860> certainly<00:02:16.490> but<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.790> know

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
understandable certainly but you know

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.280 
understandable certainly but you know
when<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.150> go<00:02:17.270> into<00:02:17.450> another<00:02:17.480> country<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.170> you

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
when you go into another country and you

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.660 
when you go into another country and you
don't<00:02:18.470> know<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.460> language<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.740> makes<00:02:22.550> it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
don't know the language then it makes it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.270 
don't know the language then it makes it
even<00:02:22.760> tougher<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.590> I've<00:02:24.590> had<00:02:24.770> too<00:02:24.890> few<00:02:25.010> those

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
even tougher so I've had too few those

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.010 
even tougher so I've had too few those
bills<00:02:25.580> I've<00:02:25.820> had<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> few<00:02:26.210> those<00:02:26.420> days<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.930> know

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
bills I've had a few those days you know

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.170 
bills I've had a few those days you know
I<00:02:27.260> think<00:02:27.380> I've<00:02:28.160> seen<00:02:28.370> some<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.670> those<00:02:28.730> videos

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
I think I've seen some of those videos

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.640 
I think I've seen some of those videos
and<00:02:29.480> there's<00:02:29.660> been<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.810> lot<00:02:29.990> more<00:02:30.020> days<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.410> I

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and there's been a lot more days that I

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.490 
and there's been a lot more days that I
didn't<00:02:31.010> video<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.670> idea<00:02:32.080> but<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.110> don't<00:02:33.380> know

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
didn't video that idea but I don't know

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.050 
didn't video that idea but I don't know
this<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:33.890> problem<00:02:34.220> probably<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.850> best

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
