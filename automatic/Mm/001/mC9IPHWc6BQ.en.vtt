00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.609 
the sickest armor in the game right from
the<00:01:33.450> start<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> actually<00:01:34.500> really

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the start is that is actually really

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
the start is that is actually really
sweet<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> guy<00:01:35.820> over<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.030> coming

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
sweet there is a guy over there coming

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
sweet there is a guy over there coming
after<00:01:36.750> us<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.770> sure<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> she

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
after us I think I'm not sure it's a she

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.460 
after us I think I'm not sure it's a she
actually<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.509> can't<00:01:39.750> open<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.170> because

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
actually and I can't open this because

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.850 
actually and I can't open this because
of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.509> dirt<00:01:42.509> block<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.899> top<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.619> can't

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
of the dirt block on top of it you can't

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
of the dirt block on top of it you can't
open<00:01:43.950> chess<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.579> day<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:45.270> an<00:01:45.450> open

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.690 
open chess on this day have an open
clear<00:01:46.079> space<00:01:46.380> above<00:01:46.619> them<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.579> one

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
clear space above them which that one

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.920 
clear space above them which that one
doesn't<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.210> gonna<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.630> try<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
doesn't so I'm just gonna go get try to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.999

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
kill someone I mean we have a really

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.350 
kill someone I mean we have a really
good<00:01:50.189> arm<00:01:50.399> right<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.030> guess<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.240> can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
good arm right now and I guess we can

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.929 
good arm right now and I guess we can
just<00:01:51.390> loot<00:01:52.170> other<00:01:52.380> people<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.610> items

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
just loot other people to get more items

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
now so that's we're going to be plan

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.719 
now so that's we're going to be plan
we're<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.560> completely<00:01:55.890> ham<00:01:56.310> we're

absolute<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.500> remember<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.920> had<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
absolute I remember I had this like a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.590 
absolute I remember I had this like a
series<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> episodes<00:02:00.119> where<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
series of episodes where I just

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.940 
series of episodes where I just
completely<00:02:00.869> beat<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.680> trap

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
completely beat it's not like a trap

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.170 
completely beat it's not like a trap
it's<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> bunch<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> friends<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.060> gonna

just<00:02:27.840> sitting<00:02:28.109> at<00:02:28.230> spawn<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:29.249> it<00:02:29.370> they

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
just sitting at spawn with it they

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.160 
just sitting at spawn with it they
somehow<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.329> like<00:02:30.420> fell<00:02:30.689> down<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> little<00:02:31.049> bit

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
somehow just like fell down a little bit

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.020 
somehow just like fell down a little bit
from<00:02:31.260> spot<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.829> then<00:02:32.159> just<00:02:32.280> like<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.430> stuck

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
from spot and then just like that stuck

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.099 
from spot and then just like that stuck
there<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.359> we're<00:02:33.450> going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.629> go<00:02:33.689> up<00:02:33.810> there<00:02:33.930> next

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
there so we're going to go up there next

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.479 
there so we're going to go up there next
to<00:02:34.260> them<00:02:34.409> we're<00:02:34.889> actually<00:02:34.980> we're<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.430> to

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
to them we're actually we're going to

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.309 
to them we're actually we're going to
try<00:02:35.609> to<00:02:35.639> kill<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.209> them<00:02:36.389> I<00:02:36.569> think<00:02:37.139> that's<00:02:37.230> a

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
try to kill all of them I think that's a

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.619 
try to kill all of them I think that's a
good<00:02:37.409> idea<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.280> hopefully<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:39.329> can<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.510> that

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
good idea and hopefully we can do that

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.990 
good idea and hopefully we can do that
mean<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:39.840> already<00:02:39.959> skillful<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.129> mean<00:02:41.909> I'm

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
mean it's already skillful I mean I'm

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.399 
mean it's already skillful I mean I'm
not<00:02:42.150> guys<00:02:42.299> same<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.719> I'm<00:02:42.810> really<00:02:42.989> good<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.319> I

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
not guys same like I'm really good if I

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.220 
not guys same like I'm really good if I
do<00:02:43.469> this<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:44.459> I'm<00:02:44.969> not<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.719> just<00:02:45.810> taking

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
do this because I'm not it's just taking

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.229 
do this because I'm not it's just taking
advantage<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.709> people<00:02:46.769> who<00:02:47.730> are<00:02:47.819> lagging<00:02:47.969> I

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
advantage of people who are lagging I

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
means next thing I think Einstein

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.629 
means next thing I think Einstein
actually<00:05:34.779> proved<00:05:34.930> that<00:05:35.080> once<00:05:35.289> his<00:05:36.099> equation<00:05:36.520> e

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
actually proved that once his equation e

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.010 
actually proved that once his equation e
equals<00:05:36.969> MC<00:05:37.029> squared<00:05:37.240> actually<00:05:37.779> it's<00:05:37.930> actually

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
equals MC squared actually it's actually

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.100 
equals MC squared actually it's actually
stands<00:05:38.349> for<00:05:38.440> snacks<00:05:39.279> e<00:05:39.490> equals<00:05:39.969> sexy<00:05:40.900> plus

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
next C squared or sex you know sexy

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.869 
next C squared or sex you know sexy
times<00:05:43.629> next<00:05:43.810> T<00:05:43.960> squared<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:44.770> uh<00:05:44.800> yeah<00:05:45.729> that's

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:45.879 
times next T squared so uh yeah that's

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.550 
times next T squared so uh yeah that's
that's<00:05:46.120> completely<00:05:46.539> legit<00:05:46.870> anyway<00:05:47.139> these
