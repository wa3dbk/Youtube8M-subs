00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
there's a strumming in the background

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:06.960 
there's a strumming in the background
which<00:01:51.480> is<00:01:51.660> just<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.170> know

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.730 

you<00:02:07.570> know<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.660> mean<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:08.080> like<00:02:08.200> real<00:02:08.350> simple

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
you know I mean just like real simple

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.720 
you know I mean just like real simple
chords<00:02:09.369> there<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.770> after<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.220> suppose<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
chords there so after that suppose the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.060 
chords there so after that suppose the
one<00:02:15.880> thing<00:02:16.090> goes

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.770 

obviously<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.190> strumming<00:02:25.520> guitar<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.570> might

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
obviously the strumming guitar it might

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.360 
obviously the strumming guitar it might
be<00:02:26.960> in<00:02:27.080> drop<00:02:27.290> D<00:02:27.320> tuning<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.920> which<00:02:28.010> case<00:02:28.220> would

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
be in drop D tuning in which case would

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.550 
be in drop D tuning in which case would
be<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:29.630> nigh<00:02:30.080> impossible<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:33.260> might<00:02:33.410> just

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
be like nigh impossible you might just

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:45.330 
be like nigh impossible you might just
do<00:02:33.740> this<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:39.190> 301<00:02:40.190> could<00:02:40.580> do<00:02:40.670> could<00:02:40.790> do<00:02:40.910> this

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.810 

how<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:46.520> it'd<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.850> D<00:02:47.090> wouldn't<00:02:47.270> it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
how because it'd be like a D wouldn't it

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.800 
how because it'd be like a D wouldn't it
there's<00:02:49.820> lots<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.030> ways<00:02:50.120> do<00:02:50.270> this<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
there's lots of ways do this but the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.710 
there's lots of ways do this but the
strumming<00:02:51.050> guitar<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.350> real<00:02:51.530> simple<00:02:51.800> chords

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
strumming guitar just real simple chords

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.930 
strumming guitar just real simple chords
or<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:53.990> do<00:02:54.080> what<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.410> like<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.520> more

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
or you can do what the like the more

00:02:55.940 --> 00:04:10.770 
or you can do what the like the more
distorted<00:02:56.480> guitar<00:02:56.870> does<00:02:57.050> which<00:02:57.260> is

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780
