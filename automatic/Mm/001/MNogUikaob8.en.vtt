00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello everyone is ex exane rhÃ´ne 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.790
 listen today we'll see 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.910
 together how to update vince 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 byron of young people so put in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.060
 day at a time so the machine but 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.510
 also the radio you'll see it's a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.430
 little particular but it's very simple to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.140
 the reach of all so to do the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.359
 update you will need the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.539
 machine of course to ride the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 nacelle because the card reader 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:38.340
 sd and so includes there on the camera so 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:46.620
 we start that radio is by aline 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 spyer is acting 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:59.629
 four times on the order is not 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:59.629
 reached so this is where we turned off 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:09.909
 she is also the radio one equips herself 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:15.090
 of the camera so the protection on 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:18.130
 also removes the protective cover 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.229
 machines made coincide the same 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.920
 marc clanche like to ride a 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.570
 lens on a camera and there 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:34.509
 roll so now that it's done 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:39.000
 you can recover the sd card so 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:46.119
 you retrieve the sd card that is found 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.289
 so on the camera is the next 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:54.090
 step is going on the computer side 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:57.729
 so here on the computer so we will insert 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.759
 the sd card on a card reader 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.360
 micro sd that is not provided eric 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.030
 meyer in brackets we're also going 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.860
 so on the site of digital spy 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.570
 roanne 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.360
 so we found in the section 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:20.380
 products in spies juan download is so 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.519
 there you have the Firmware 1.2.0 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:30.610
 tip 16 so we download the zip 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:32.560
 complete here is the file being 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.170
 now download it must be 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.170
 unzip it's a point point rats 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.810
 a lot we unzip 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.350
 there is a binebin point which is at 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.260
 interior 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:56.150
 this file which 67th now 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:03:07.579
 this file that my map roots 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:07.579
 SD showing more as simple as that 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.569
 hop we close everything we get the card 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.470
 the following happens the daily spyer 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.519
 now that the firmware is 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.840
 can be found in the map 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.870
 reinsert directly into the camera's 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.390
 the hymn spyer for the update not 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.680
 need to plug a link from elsewhere a 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.670
 usb everything will happen automatically 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.680
 so there if we had a machine the setting 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.000
 day can be done automatically 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.930
 However ligia therefore been proposed to 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.930
 log on 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.049
 the application so ji driver you can 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:55.690
 have on smartphone or tablet for 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.879
 to have just advanced the state of the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:05.730
 update 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:05.730
 so I launch the radio app 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.760
 here 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:23.000
 we trust the machine 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:36.499
 it will therefore initialize and emit 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:36.499
 a series of old firm sounds yeah ok 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.850
 so there the progress of the update 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.689
 already the advice that the battery of 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:02.219
 lives by the way very busy at least 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:04.839
 50% any advice they are 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:09.009
 loaded at 100 years still for 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:12.639
 for the tablet ensure that there 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:15.879
 have enough battery cloclo the 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.810
 radio so the machine will emit 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.980
 beeps 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.980
 the update must be completed 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.520
 So here is once arrived at 100% the 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.889
 machine at the end 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.550
 it restarts and the update is 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.550
 now installed 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.730
 so to update the radio is 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.560
 very simple we will use the same 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:09.850
 Firmware is always safe on the map 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:14.310
 we will insert here in a reader of 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:22.889
 microsd cards that integrates a usb port 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:35.010
 so we have orange radio usb port 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:38.830
 we know the map to resist and there 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.919
 we switch on again we wait for the 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.919
 moment 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:52.009
 and the movie - vassals the aude is 

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:55.609
 automatically there for once he can 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.759
 plus the connect type be it all the 

00:06:55.609 --> 00:07:03.219
 usb port and the ja busy that pucca 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:12.109
 wait for state help no blues 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:15.999
 that she was born a tone the setting 

00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:15.999
 day but less long soul in china 

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:23.449
 here you know now that we put 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:27.019
 up to date your inspired as well as his 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:29.269
 controller we will continue a small 

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:31.009
 series rather to introduce you to the 

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:33.289
 capabilities of the machine the possibilities 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:35.029
 in flight of this last so with the 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.189
 presentations are the different modes 

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:42.379
 flights or tablet functions 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:43.969
 of the camera video essays of 

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.459
 rush for you to get from 

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:50.179
 lot of the quality of the camera 

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:52.399
