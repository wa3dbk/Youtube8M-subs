 beauty dot com 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.250
 Today I promise to make a video as well. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 I will not be gesticulating quickly. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.800
 and moving like crazy behave a lot 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.350
 well then the tip today is one in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.980
 an excellent tip that will make the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.789
 your enamel will last much longer without 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.989
 sugar 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.149
 An excellent tip I 've ever experienced 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.430
 I okay, I already teach you. It's okay. 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.309
 It was even a hint of a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.320
 pb reading and when I saw I wanted to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.789
 go crazy to be able to experience told 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.739
 Guys, it 's all right. 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.480
 very strange and I already tried 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.670
 sometimes it works and I guarantee that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680
 You'll continue quite a lot, I am. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.660
 that kind of person who passes enamel 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.329
 Enamel already come out is one is simply 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.449
 Stunning enamel does not stop at my 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.700
 nail dishwasher I would flush the toilet 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.880
 a house also teachers came in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 wanting the same glaze frame 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.710
 so one day sometimes a few hours 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 then ax of the castle deputy 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.830
 if you think so too, you are 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.009
 great 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.729
 I think I'm using this new 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.890
 chanel 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.500
 he can bid on the camera - he 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.869
 is my port the color nor does it have black with a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 a little gold and gray 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.409
 black but being presented with glitter 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.259
 very fine gold and is called a recall 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.159
 and I do not know that we glaze 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.220
 chanel 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.869
 For me, the more yellow chips 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.869
 honestly I do not see anything too not 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.479
 I recommend the window glazes and the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.860
 formula depends on the wedge I already had 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.920
 experience of things that were a little 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 better but this one in case I passed 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.479
 and the meat has started and it's already gone 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 chipped here in mine, not the end 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.530
 I decided to do it now in front of the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.719
 camera that you but at last we chanel 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.050
 that is the hill and then but this 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.390
 helps increase the lives of your 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.060
 motes is to get him in draft and 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.260
 that lasts a lot more boots will need 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.170
 are two ingredients two things ne 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.629
 in case this one is a shine a top 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.910
 normal ok coat and glue super bonder 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.500
 more liquid , preferably 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 can be considered normal 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.879
 in the case here it is more general 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.200
 fulfilled and come but the same thing 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.090
 about rooney 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.519
 so what to do with that you can see 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 Here're less than half just under 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.489
 half 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.170
 the topic is a glow that goes 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:57.540
 simply to baptize this glow with 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:01.379
 super simple and so it goes really 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.629
 The grommet is not very much measured. 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:09.360
 in case you can put more super 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.920
 small bonder you can put more 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.720
 you prefer 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.200
 the more so with the glue the Grossinho 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.940
 Your brilliance does not play out better. 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:38.340
 so you do this puts a whole glass 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:40.760
 super bonder within the small bottle of much 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.760
 paste 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.530
 so if you think it got too much 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.620
 thick and when it will really harden 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.379
 a little more however is putting more 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.140
 a little sparkle without being baptized and 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:06.439
 ready you can use it normally and there 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.439
 You're going to pick up this baptized topic. 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:22.049
 usually and then you can 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.729
 let it dry a little bit but soon 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.950
 followed to finish 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.640
 you will pass 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:33.920
 a blinking brightness a topic is no longer 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:39.790
 baptized the same only for the nail becomes 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.790
 and much more lisinha're finalizing all 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.580
 ready 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:51.200
 after doing this to your manicure and 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:55.070
 homemade gel is ready finished this 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.720
 even ensures that your manicure will now 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.310
 lasting a week or even longer until two 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.650
 weeks depending on what you do in the 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.740
 a person like me who uses his hands a lot 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.700
 wash your face harder a week without 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.690
 to peel 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.570
 is this works even in homemade algiers 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.790
 a good gambiarra that will save your 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.450
 manicure and I 'm going to stay here 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.450
 A kiss, bye.
