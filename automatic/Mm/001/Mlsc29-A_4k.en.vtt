00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
but if go bad even got that cuz I look

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.520 
but if go bad even got that cuz I look
maybe<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.150> could<00:01:46.300> just<00:01:46.390> have<00:01:47.050> hit<00:01:47.260> him<00:01:47.350> through

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
maybe I could just have hit him through
