00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.380
 and greet everyone knows 2009 which is 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.180
 find for the after patch of the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.460
 technical improvised that allowed to 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.170
 import vehicles from solo to online 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.540
 so first of all you have to put in 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.370
 last respawn parameter 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.440
 position and you can see the passage 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.200
 that I'm good at 1.11 so the 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.210
 last update 2 gta then he 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.460
 you simply will not be able to 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.500
 put where you want that 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.150
 your vehicle arrives so will have to 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.340
 learned to go back there once in solo 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.790
 see you later understand on behalf 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.260
 video 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.250
 for me it was towards the starter 400 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.380
 miles later you will go solo you 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.840
 will leave I was online then you will be there 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.000
 will return except that instead of going 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.550
 it's great in session on invitation 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.030
 as was done at the very beginning this 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.570
 once it will be necessary each time the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:09.100
 in session 28 yards of tera online 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.770
 lightened ternheim and fargo directly 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.979
 so that's it then you'll have to 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.310
 returned solo but simply to 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.979
 from the xbox live market menu or the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.260
 psn his steps also on the psn and 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.570
 while that puts you loading 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.400
 to heaven so at the moment your 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.570
 famous camera you're going offline 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.939
 your profile 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.820
 so you disconnect it entirely ca 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.820
 same manipulation so you have to make the button 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 at best of your controller then x or 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.670
 squares for ps3 finally i know more ps3 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.360
 but in any case it's the equivalent of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.820
 the x button for xbox joystick we see 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.520
 So that brings you back to your mom 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.030
 for the time we are loading 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.369
 prologue 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.259
 you will reconnect with your 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.840
 profile load and the backup that 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.100
 owns the car so I believe that 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.439
 it was there rather than I imported in 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.390
 online so you choose well your 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.429
 profile no matter whether they are on a 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.180
 usb key or on your console it did not 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.250
 no importance 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.330
 you are looking for your profile and you are going 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.730
 take the path of 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.030
 on in question so that's for those who 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.920
 are interested me this is the picture I 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.340
 no longer exactly and you're going all 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.290
 just bring it to the place where you 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.660
 have you disconnected me it was 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.840
 well towards the part at 400 miles once 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.230
 that makes you go on the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.810
 start button online and do well 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.790
 play gta online go you're not going 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.840
 click on no audition you do 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.630
 well go it's exactly if you do 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.040
 another thing I tested it's not going 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.500
 bring your vehicle you really need 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.990
 do go and once online us as 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.520
 you see there is my picture so here it is 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.690
 so to show you that studying a 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.080
 functional I will go into my 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.620
 garage 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.620
 as usual we can not go in 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.140
 supersports in his garage but 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.570
 I'm on the track maybe a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.350
 after patch thinks for finally or of 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.070
 least another method 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.420
 I do not know if the technique for 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.040
 return any vehicle was 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.390
 patched if she's not patched you 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.970

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.500

 useful I intend to send him maggots already 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.220

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.690
 always and I tell you love the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.650
