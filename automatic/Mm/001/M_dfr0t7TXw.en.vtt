 to know that other food peels 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.460

 obviously that the king probably 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.770
 reutilization of husks stalks leaves 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.330
 help prevent food waste 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.370
 that the world is low nowadays 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.890
 but it also does well and has nutrients 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.290
 What vitamins are proteins? 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.720
 advantage the advantage of 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.910
 to use the bark of food is that 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.310
 besides the people avoiding the waste people 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.070
 is taking advantage of a greater amount 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.470
 fibers that exist in the boxes that 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.260
 they are often thrown out right 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.710
 and in addition to fibers have to be general 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.340
 for plenty of minerals and vitamins as well 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.350
 this all helps composition takes up a 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.810
 daily menu with 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.580
 sure what the fruits and vegetables are 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.790
 that you consider to have a potential 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.130
 with these nutrients we can 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.940
 take advantage of the shell for example 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.090
 pineapple is the bark of the jerimum also the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.850
 apple peel 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.410
 all of them are very rich in vitamins 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.340
 and minerals that we can is 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.900
 taking the opportunity to make juices and sweets 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.560
 other recipes so they can 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.890
 cause we feel the juice of the bark 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.000
 pineapple we put mint is 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.580
 a highly appreciated recipe in the 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.160
 rich in nutrients and vitamins and 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.670
 minerals and we also have 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.070
 banana peel which is a recipe too 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.440
 much appreciated in the program of the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.880
 brazil is good until you talk about 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.650
 show cooking brazil you are 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.590
 program nutritionist 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.480
 brazil cuisine that here in manaus already has 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.590
 already going to the 6th year 75 years goes 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.720
 process the eyes 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.520
 This is a winning program too. 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.050
 other places in Brazil like 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.030
 started this program and how many people 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.210
 have already been formed here in our region 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.640
 this program began in 1994 in the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.180
 State sao paulo right where 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:23.170
 nutritionists were the recipes is 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.170
 from stalks of seed husks right 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.590
 fruits and vegetables that were very 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.590
 wasted 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:34.270
 So it's this program he started here. 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.400
 in 2005 and has already graduated 27 out of 27 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.880
 thousand people 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.290
 now a doubt that remains program 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.210
 My doubt that I believe is of 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.400
 many people also how to 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.350
 hygiene of the bark that usually does not 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.510
 is on the ground it is transported 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.160
 so not as hygienic right we 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.800
 he just feels sure that people 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.200
 cut plays but to reuse 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.210
 What are the hygiene tips? 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.870
 It is always important that we have a 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.330
 appropriate brush or house to be able to 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.980
 keep washing the vegetables 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.850
 learn with nothing special but is 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.680
 specific for washing the fruit not 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.130
 no better for carving 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.290
 clothes then first brush well 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.750
 mainly pineapple peel of 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.229
 banana and then it's important to us 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.080
 wash in running water and leave to soak 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:29.080
 in chlorinated solution that people orient 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.990
 a bleach tablespoon or 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.330
 sodium hypochlorite to one liter of 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.260
 water with the idea of consuming 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.390
 safe 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.150
 after soaking for 15 minutes 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:43.240
 in this solution we remove with water 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:47.260
 you can take advantage of it to make 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.270
 the cake safely way if it is 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.270
