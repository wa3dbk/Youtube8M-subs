a<00:00:05.759> bit<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.150> setup<00:00:06.359> in<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.140> beginning<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
a bit of setup in the beginning of the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.549 
a bit of setup in the beginning of the
trick<00:00:08.450> you<00:00:09.450> need<00:00:10.040> two<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.670> same<00:00:11.880> card<00:00:12.559> and

trick you need two of the same card and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.900 
trick you need two of the same card and
one<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.889> them<00:00:14.009> needs<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.340> be<00:00:14.460> different<00:00:14.790> than

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
one of them needs to be different than

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120 
one of them needs to be different than
the<00:00:14.969> rest<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> deck<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.980> have

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the rest of the deck so for this I have

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.960 
the rest of the deck so for this I have
used<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.880> black<00:00:18.660> ghost<00:00:18.930> deck<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.369> nine<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
used a black ghost deck and the nine of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900 
used a black ghost deck and the nine of
clubs<00:00:21.150> from<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.080> Black<00:00:22.289> Tiger<00:00:22.650> deck<00:00:22.910> all

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
clubs from the Black Tiger deck all

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.029 
clubs from the Black Tiger deck all
right<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.420> works<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.890> it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
right it works if you do this and it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.040 
right it works if you do this and it
also<00:00:26.130> works<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.439> use<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:29.900> red<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
also works if you if you use a red and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.420 
also works if you if you use a red and
blue<00:00:31.170> bicycle<00:00:33.170> even<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.260> normal<00:00:34.890> bicycle<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
blue bicycle even a normal bicycle and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.190 
blue bicycle even a normal bicycle and
vintage<00:00:35.760> 1800<00:00:36.270> would<00:00:36.420> work<00:00:36.570> well<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:37.050> well<00:00:37.290> um

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
vintage 1800 would work well as well um

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.080 
vintage 1800 would work well as well um
so<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> cards<00:00:41.399> need<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.760> same

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
so but the cards need to look the same

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.290 
so but the cards need to look the same
so<00:00:42.710> like<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.920> black<00:00:44.160> ghost<00:00:44.399> would<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.120> work

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so like a black ghost would not work

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.299 
so like a black ghost would not work
with<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> ghost<00:00:45.780> deck<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.100> ghost

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
with the ghost deck because the ghost

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
with the ghost deck because the ghost
has<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.780> white<00:00:48.780> background<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.920> black

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
has the white background and the black

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
has the white background and the black
pips<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> black<00:00:51.030> ghost<00:00:51.300> has<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.989> left

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pips and the black ghost has the left

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
pips and the black ghost has the left
background<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> white<00:00:53.340> pips<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> they

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
background and the white pips so they

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
background and the white pips so they
need<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> look<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.199> same<00:00:56.059> alright<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.210> that's

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
need to look the same alright so that's

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.700 
need to look the same alright so that's
why<00:00:57.480> I've<00:00:57.570> chosen<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.989> black<00:00:58.170> ghosts<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
why I've chosen the black ghosts in the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.369 
why I've chosen the black ghosts in the
black<00:00:58.890> tiger<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> two<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.320> are

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
black tiger so you get the two that are

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.579 
black tiger so you get the two that are
the<00:01:01.559> same<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.120> different

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
the same and the one that is different

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.399 
the same and the one that is different
goes<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> bottom<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> deck<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.570> then

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
goes on the bottom of the deck and then

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.219 
goes on the bottom of the deck and then
the<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> duplicate<00:01:09.049> goes<00:01:10.049> on

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the one that is the duplicate goes on

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.770 
the one that is the duplicate goes on
top<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.369> entire<00:01:11.670> deck<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.479> top<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
top of that the entire deck is on top of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
top of that the entire deck is on top of
that<00:01:12.840> set<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:14.189> why<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> don't<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that set up that's why you don't want to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.219
