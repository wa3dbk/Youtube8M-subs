 I just have to know what's going on here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.730
 I think we are in a war 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.350
 devices 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.950

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.230

 with which I earn my money 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.060

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.750
 you are I want her found and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.750

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.190
 why are you helping me? 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.070
 your earth is a very small part 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.610
 a very big industry 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.290
 after owns the right to the earth 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.720
 if you claim it the earth 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.790
 you own it I let this planet 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.650
 to devastate than to take from her in me 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.300
 to let 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.869
 we need a turn we need 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.869
 firepower 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.960
 if we do not come to 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.550
 you are looking for and a whole life after 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.600
 their 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.600
 and she is down there 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.370
 it starts 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.090
 you'll stay dead until he dies 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.400
 jupiter sending goes today and 27 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.860
 minutes is released from twelve years 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.380
 and starts in 3d from the fifth of february 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.190
 2015 in german cinemas and tells 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.569
 the story of humanity 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.760
 or the knowledge that we 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.590
 are not alone in this universe 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.300
 no, we are only a kind of sati 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.400
 for another particular and the question to whom 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.900
 the universe is part of this for the long 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.610
 time was clarified there is only one wheel 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.620
 inheritance dispute between two houses 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.300
 and two competitors one of them 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.769
 the redmayne's just for the oscar 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.269
 nominate this as for his presentation 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.530
 as stephen hawking and that too now 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.269
 really characterize me in the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.890
 But this fight is going on 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.420
 someday a little bit 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.920
 more interesting than a girl or a girl 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.600
 young woman actually rather than 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 Cleaning force on the earth works called 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.650
 jupiter jones played by mila kunis 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.150
 can claim on this throne 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.530
 why I want that here, of course 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.239
 not spoilers but above all it is one 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.130
 Mercenaries by their side called Kane 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.480
 played by channing tatum who tries 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.160
 to protect them because there is enough 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.630
 People who want to get to them either want them 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.440
 to force a contract or preferably 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.940
 to murder 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.319
 and so it is the question how far can 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.730
 you can corrupt them and how far can you 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.350
 to gain the power of the universe 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.640
 so that the jupiter's selling one 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.010
 Huge science fiction adventure 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.049
 action film with a romantic twist 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.400
 and intersects with so many 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.780
 genre that was when you look at the film 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.579
 does not see what it really is 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.630
 clearly we are honest we tried their 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.070
 so a bit of natural people into it 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.810
 to draw cinema one says the oif in the 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.579
 wachau channing tatum mila kunis the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.320
 Teeth whole crowd to mainstream audience 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.269
 in the cinemas and the movie looks too 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.829
 In many moments relatively good too 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.180
 the 3d works fine but you have 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.680
 Get up close and personal with science fiction 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.160
 overlooked and you can not feel it 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.239
 Get rid of 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.040
 that was never a bit of a direction 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.600
 star wars necessarily want to drift 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.420
 everything seems a bit too plastic 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.489
 and to shine through the barrel length of 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.959
 127 minutes is then very long because 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.060
 at the core you can be very early 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.709
 ran where the movie hinwil and played 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.150
 the acting in most 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.040
 Moments are not necessarily 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.600
 surprisingly many characters are too 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.100
 heavily oversubscribed and that's how you look forward to it 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.840
 like to see you again with a like 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.220
 sean bean among others still in the cast 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.810
 but that's not enough 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.430
 sits in the cinema for over two hours 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.229
 But if you enjoy the movie 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.640
 Once again, there is a look 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.110
 you look at the cinema because he's his 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.530
 correct power of vision it has the big one 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.150
 canvas 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.500
 the educator can train and that 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.420
 should be double at the end of me means 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.070
 sending there was much tamtam state 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.330
 Deferring dates and co at the end 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.889
 stripes where I would say the one must 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.660
 really did not see and when 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.250
 you still do it with restrained 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.600
 expectations but if then just on the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.919
 Cinema screen in 3d 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.410
 that's the most fun thing 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.970
 respectively on imax format and 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.040
 at the end until its creator the mobile phone 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.630
 gets from me as yes science fiction 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.980
 action movie which somehow times 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.389
 subordinate even if the romantic 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.610
 a blow for that genre ticking too 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.139
 much is six and a half out of ten possible 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.250
 score because he is still in the craft 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.230
 pretty neat on the technical 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.610
 side is under is acceptable 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.350
 after that, but one after 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.180
 mediocre number five and a half out of 10 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.070
 possible points of total and there 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.900
 I'm through my richie Peter 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.850
 henning from 5 february in the cinemas 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.540
 lask on a thumb there if this 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.130
 video made 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.240
 Let's not leave it that otherwise 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.070
 You know there are a few left around 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.870
 me around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock of course 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.820
 at the latest a new video 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.400
 until then I hope here for weeks 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.750
 of course we were there again 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.850
 taught the birthplace of 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.060
 Mankind is the earth , but it is 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.060
 Not 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.260
 do you know what that will have if 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.260
 the people experience the truth 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.919
 I think most of them would 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.520
 truth do not want to know 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.520
 Me, yes 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.700
 new planet was about 100,000 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.790
 years of abreu sex industries 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.840
 opened up 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.660
 she is one of the most powerful dynasties 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.270
 of the universe there are three main heirs 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.440
 the oldest is in control of this 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.440
 planets and I would let kill 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.060
 believe me I'm nothing special yours 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.060
 majesty 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.800
 if exactly the same gene in exactly 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.360
 reappear in the same order 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.360
 This is called reincarnation 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.580
 majesty will change when 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.240
 she wishes it I am still 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.039
 the same 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.259
 still has all the right to the 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:41.130
 earth if you claim it will 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.130
 Earth belongs to you 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.249
 he lets me devastate this planet 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.079
 than to let her take her from me 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:50.699
 have you ever seen such a thing yet ? 

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:53.149
 never but it is said they did not feel any 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.149
 pain 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.840
 here the truth would have told me that 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.840
 also for whom they wanted 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:24.990
 this planet does not belong to me now 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:29.059
 more why i have a dog 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.059
 more mean than with you I love you 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.469
 it starts
