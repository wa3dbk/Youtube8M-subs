00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it on my hands little grains of sand the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
it on my hands little grains of sand the
way<00:01:59.670> they<00:01:59.820> make<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.509> take<00:02:00.659> these

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
way they make this is they take these

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.499 
way they make this is they take these
little<00:02:01.140> pieces<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.040> plastic<00:02:02.460> polymer<00:02:03.000> tiny

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
little pieces of plastic polymer tiny

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.780 
little pieces of plastic polymer tiny
little<00:02:03.960> pieces<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:05.070> mix<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> with

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
little pieces and they mix it with

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.730 
little pieces and they mix it with
regular<00:02:06.180> sand<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.899> basically<00:02:07.350> just

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
regular sand which is basically just

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770 
regular sand which is basically just
rocks<00:02:08.340> broken<00:02:08.879> down<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> particular<00:02:09.569> size

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
rocks broken down to a particular size

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380 
rocks broken down to a particular size
and<00:02:10.140> somehow<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.800> combination<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.239> two

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and somehow that combination of the two

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.490 
and somehow that combination of the two
different

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
different

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.559 
different
pieces<00:02:14.500> allows<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.730> behave<00:02:15.880> in<00:02:16.420> this

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
pieces allows it to behave in this

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.250 
pieces allows it to behave in this
interesting<00:02:17.500> way<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.940> even<00:02:19.300> within<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:20.050> you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
interesting way but even within that you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.420 
interesting way but even within that you
would<00:02:20.380> think<00:02:20.500> all<00:02:20.680> these<00:02:20.830> sands<00:02:21.160> would<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
would think all these sands would be the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.699 
would think all these sands would be the
same<00:02:21.640> there's<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> lot<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.360> differences<00:02:22.840> okay

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
same there's a lot of differences okay

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.210 
same there's a lot of differences okay
time<00:02:23.920> for<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.100> smell<00:02:24.340> test<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.790> ready<00:02:26.220> pretty

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
time for the smell test you ready pretty

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.030 
time for the smell test you ready pretty
good<00:02:27.430> yeah<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.110> remember<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.770> these<00:02:29.890> we

open and the whole room smelled bad for

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.350 
open and the whole room smelled bad for
like<00:02:32.530> two<00:02:32.739> days<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.430> don't<00:02:33.940> remember<00:02:34.150> which<00:02:34.300> one

tried out all these different sayings
okay<00:02:40.900> let's<00:02:41.200> see<00:02:41.380> how<00:02:41.590> well<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.150> uses<00:02:43.150> and

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
okay let's see how well this uses and

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:53.050 
okay let's see how well this uses and
pours

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.350 

what<00:02:53.600> do<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:54.430> yeah<00:02:55.430> everyone<00:02:55.910> forget

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
what do you think yeah everyone forget

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.340 
what do you think yeah everyone forget
that<00:02:56.480> they're<00:02:56.630> running<00:02:56.780> through<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.050> fingers

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
that they're running through the fingers

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.960 
that they're running through the fingers
on<00:02:57.590> it

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
on it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.059 
on it
hmm<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.900> Sam<00:03:00.170> feels<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.650> don't<00:03:00.680> know<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
hmm this this Sam feels I don't know the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.130 
hmm this this Sam feels I don't know the
word<00:03:01.250> for<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.640> would<00:03:01.700> say<00:03:01.940> drier<00:03:02.360> do<00:03:03.080> you

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
word for it I would say drier do you

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
word for it I would say drier do you
think<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.470> feels<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.800> way

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
think it feels that way

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.250 
think it feels that way
it<00:03:04.459> feels<00:03:04.730> drier<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.600> feels<00:03:05.840> like<00:03:06.050> the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
it feels drier and it feels like the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.230 
it feels drier and it feels like the
little<00:03:06.530> that's<00:03:07.459> why<00:03:07.610> those<00:03:07.850> little

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
little that's why those little

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.479 
little that's why those little
individual<00:03:09.080> sand<00:03:09.380> grains<00:03:09.709> keep<00:03:10.010> coming<00:03:10.310> off

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
individual sand grains keep coming off

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.820 
individual sand grains keep coming off
sticking<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.150> fingers<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.959> guess<00:03:12.380> came

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
sticking to my fingers and I guess came

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.320 
sticking to my fingers and I guess came
loose<00:03:13.010> in<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> box<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.819> are<00:03:13.910> now<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:14.239> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
loose in the box that are now on the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.809 
loose in the box that are now on the
desk<00:03:14.540> now<00:03:15.440> let's<00:03:15.620> see<00:03:15.770> once<00:03:15.980> we've<00:03:16.160> made<00:03:16.489> a

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
desk now let's see once we've made a

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.790 
desk now let's see once we've made a
shape<00:03:17.420> or<00:03:17.600> an<00:03:17.720> object<00:03:17.870> with<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.350> sand<00:03:18.590> how

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
shape or an object with the sand how

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.160 
shape or an object with the sand how
long<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.100> holds<00:03:19.400> together<00:03:19.550> before<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.300> oozes

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
long it holds together before it oozes

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.559 
long it holds together before it oozes
out<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.400> pretty<00:03:22.610> good<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.180> really

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
out this is pretty good this is really

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.470 
out this is pretty good this is really
holding<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.860> shape<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.519> lot<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.360> other

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
holding the shape a lot of the other

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.850 
holding the shape a lot of the other
sands<00:03:26.780> would<00:03:26.989> already<00:03:27.170> have<00:03:27.290> been<00:03:27.380> pouring

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
sands would already have been pouring

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.150 
sands would already have been pouring
out<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.340> my<00:03:28.640> hand<00:03:28.850> by<00:03:29.060> now<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:30.200> that's<00:03:30.739> one

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
out of my hand by now so that's one

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.009 
out of my hand by now so that's one
strength<00:03:31.700> of<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:32.120> sand<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.720> if<00:03:32.870> you're

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
strength of this sand is if you're

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.199 
strength of this sand is if you're
looking<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.350> make<00:03:33.500> some<00:03:33.530> shapes<00:03:34.040> with<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.519> it

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
looking to make some shapes with it it

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.580 
looking to make some shapes with it it
looks<00:03:35.390> like<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.660> will<00:03:35.780> hold<00:03:35.930> together<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:36.560> a

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
looks like it will hold together for a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.350 
looks like it will hold together for a
while<00:03:36.739> oh<00:03:37.010> there<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.550> goes<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:40.209> guess<00:03:41.209> I'm

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
while oh there it goes I guess I'm

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.400 
while oh there it goes I guess I'm
hungry<00:03:41.660> because<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.900> haven't<00:03:42.170> eaten<00:03:42.290> this

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
hungry because I haven't eaten this

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.540 
hungry because I haven't eaten this
morning<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:42.890> appear<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.400> made<00:03:43.489> a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
morning but I appear to have made a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.590 
morning but I appear to have made a
Twinkie<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:45.370> wasn't<00:03:46.370> going<00:03:46.519> for<00:03:46.670> skyscraper<00:03:47.569> I

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
Twinkie I wasn't going for skyscraper I
