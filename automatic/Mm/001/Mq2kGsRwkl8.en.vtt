00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
an exhibition of that also but these

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.150 
an exhibition of that also but these

the<00:00:44.309> time<00:00:44.460> he<00:00:44.879> made<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.770> people<00:00:46.770> thought

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the time he made them and people thought

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.020 
the time he made them and people thought
that<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.430> were<00:00:47.629> depressing<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:49.920> kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> dead

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that they were depressing a kind of dead

that they were depressing a kind of dead
end<00:00:51.329> when<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> don't<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.559> them<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.770> way<00:00:53.129> at

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
end when I don't see them that way at

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
end when I don't see them that way at
all<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> they're<00:00:54.620> almost<00:00:55.620> like

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
all I think that they're almost like

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.299 
all I think that they're almost like
views<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.520> eternity<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.739> difference<00:00:59.129> between

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
views of eternity the difference between

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.599 
views of eternity the difference between
these<00:00:59.609> paintings<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.420> his<00:01:01.289> classic<00:01:02.129> pictures

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
these paintings and his classic pictures

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.660 
these paintings and his classic pictures
is<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.309> white

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
is that some of them have this white

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.510 
is that some of them have this white

are<00:01:19.080> contained<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:20.580> different<00:01:21.030> way<00:01:21.240> so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
are contained in a very different way so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170 
are contained in a very different way so
where<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> other<00:01:22.590> paintings<00:01:23.159> come<00:01:23.369> forward

these<00:01:24.570> paintings<00:01:25.049> actually<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.799> backwards

these paintings actually go backwards

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.300 
these paintings actually go backwards
into<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.509> wall<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> more<00:01:28.320> classical<00:01:28.950> sense

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
into the wall in a more classical sense

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.660 
into the wall in a more classical sense
but<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.140> romantic<00:01:32.180> view<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
but I think that this romantic view of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.960 
but I think that this romantic view of
of<00:01:35.670> eternity<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> landscape<00:01:37.970> although

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of eternity not a landscape although

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
of eternity not a landscape although
people<00:01:39.150> love<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> read<00:01:39.780> his<00:01:40.020> works<00:01:40.290> as

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
people love to read his works as

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140 
people love to read his works as
landscape<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.850> they<00:01:42.000> are

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
landscape so it's not what they are

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.289 
landscape so it's not what they are
they're<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> balancing<00:01:43.439> act<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.820> quality

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
they're a balancing act and the quality

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
they're a balancing act and the quality
of<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> painting<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.740> much<00:01:47.640> more

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
of the painting on these is much more

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.179 
of the painting on these is much more
expressionistic<00:01:48.630> than<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.560> any<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> other

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
expressionistic than on any of the other

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.969 
expressionistic than on any of the other
works<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.659> Rothko<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.619> sort<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
works and I think Rothko is sort of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
works and I think Rothko is sort of
taking<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.329> stops<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:55.200> these

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
taking out all the stops with these

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.030 
taking out all the stops with these
pictures<00:01:55.790> taking<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> color<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.649> taking<00:01:58.649> all

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
pictures taking the color out taking all

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
pictures taking the color out taking all
of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> formal<00:01:59.939> considerations<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
of the formal considerations and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
of the formal considerations and
compositional<00:02:01.860> aspects<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
compositional aspects out of it and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.249 
compositional aspects out of it and
pushing<00:02:04.170> his<00:02:04.350> painting<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> edge<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
pushing his painting to the edge of

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.160 
pushing his painting to the edge of
where<00:02:07.259> he<00:02:07.469> was<00:02:07.590> going

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
where he was going

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.210 
where he was going
these<00:02:10.170> works<00:02:10.619> really<00:02:11.160> lead<00:02:11.700> in

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
these works really lead in

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.380 
these works really lead in
to<00:02:12.450> minimalism<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.560> funny<00:02:14.860> way<00:02:15.390> there's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
to minimalism in a funny way there's

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.130 
to minimalism in a funny way there's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
I took everything out of a painting that

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.400 
I took everything out of a painting that
could<00:03:42.190> possibly<00:03:42.610> consider<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.269> painting<00:03:43.750> but

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
could possibly consider the painting but

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.380 
could possibly consider the painting but
they<00:03:44.920> become<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.790> kind<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:47.040> mantra<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.580> very

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
they become a kind of mantra a very

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.949 
they become a kind of mantra a very
subtle<00:03:50.220> expressionistic<00:03:51.220> painting<00:03:51.959> so

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
subtle expressionistic painting so

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.289 
subtle expressionistic painting so
minimalism<00:03:53.739> till<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.280> gets<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.790> people<00:03:54.940> like

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
minimalism till it gets to people like

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:04.850 
minimalism till it gets to people like
the<00:03:55.570> wit<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:59.730> Jud<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:02.049> still<00:04:02.530> romantic<00:04:03.220> and

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
the wit and Jud is still romantic and

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.199 
the wit and Jud is still romantic and
actually<00:04:05.860> there's<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.070> high<00:04:06.310> level<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.730> romance

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
actually there's a high level of romance

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.640 
actually there's a high level of romance
and<00:04:07.480> those<00:04:07.660> two<00:04:08.019> but<00:04:08.320> it's<00:04:08.470> still

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and those two but it's still

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.299 
and those two but it's still
expressionistic<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.820> should<00:04:10.060> say
