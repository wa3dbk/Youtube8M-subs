00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.679
 do not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 hello very good was doing about 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.039
 chorus for a song a cover that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.390
 I'm doing 6 lay dying that they have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.220
 a choir and there seems to be a stadium 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.480
 whole and shouting there the choir instead of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.430
 have to record 20,000 million 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 voices to do the choirs simply 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.110
 creates baix two voices two voice tracks and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.110
 you can do it with frei screen in plan 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.420
 to these cream friars so they do not 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.250
 know how to do so I have a couple of videos 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.450
 over here how to make cream sentences 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.650
 free screen as it has is the sound 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.600
 characteristic in flat 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.970
 it pretty much sounds like a crowd 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 then simply recording two tracks 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.710
 of frei screen see how one is here 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.050
 do not 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.260
 that seems 20,000 million voices 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.170
 singing there at the same time are simply 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.640
 two voices doing there he writes a 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.870
 little bit and maybe a little bit of reverb 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.420
 in the voice so you have a little more of 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.830
 like the typical stadium and well this is 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.910
 can do with two voices already is 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.860
 pretty good but good here I made 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.050
 a test with seven voices I think they are 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.370
 and well the truth is that it seems three 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.370
 stadiums at the same time there are singing 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.969
 good 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.560
 if you use many clues what you can 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.210
 to do is a hundred percent penalties to 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.250
 the left another 100 to the right 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 another 50 for example on the left 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.479
 another 50% to the right others in the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.969
 center do not keep playing a little bit to 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.740
 that more is coming what is the 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.090
 outside feeling and now let's see 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.439
 like a whole stadium every time I 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.439
 I say see plugins, answer me 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.180
 well clear 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.860
 and well you know with the screen friar 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 you can make a feeling that there's 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.190
 some choruses there are brutal you have a 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.620
 little bit of ribery and a little more is left 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.390
 so in concert plan and well I hope that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.390
 you liked it and we'll see what I do
