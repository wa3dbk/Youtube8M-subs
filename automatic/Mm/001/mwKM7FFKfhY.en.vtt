00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
looking for a pretty good cornerback

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.679 
looking for a pretty good cornerback
definitely<00:01:05.610> use<00:01:05.729> Charles<00:01:06.090> Tillman<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.540> was

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
definitely use Charles Tillman I was

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.120 
definitely use Charles Tillman I was
using<00:01:06.869> them<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.229> while<00:01:07.320> he's<00:01:07.650> pretty<00:01:07.950> good

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
using them for a while he's pretty good

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.149 
using them for a while he's pretty good
but<00:01:08.460> every<00:01:09.360> area<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.900> Tilghman<00:01:10.290> excels<00:01:10.890> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
but every area that Tilghman excels it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.219 
but every area that Tilghman excels it
for<00:01:11.340> being<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.610> physical<00:01:12.090> cornerback<00:01:12.659> Jennings

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
for being a physical cornerback Jennings

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.620 
for being a physical cornerback Jennings
suffers<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.790> he's<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
suffers it because he's more of a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.179 
suffers it because he's more of a
coverage<00:01:16.020> cornerback<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> easiest

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
coverage cornerback that's the easiest

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
coverage cornerback that's the easiest
way<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.270> break<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
way that I can actually break down the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
way that I can actually break down the
stacks<00:01:19.530> without<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.220> into<00:01:20.400> each<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.880> one

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
stacks without going into each one one

which is quite bad just like I told you
guys<00:01:29.040> he's<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.360> coverage<00:01:30.840> cornerback

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
guys he's more of a coverage cornerback

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.990 
guys he's more of a coverage cornerback
as<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.799> guys<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> second<00:01:32.640> play<00:01:32.759> which
