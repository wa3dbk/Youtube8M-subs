00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.809
 Hello people welcome to another test video this time we are 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.829
 hard to recognize us not primarily around the core values 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:18.939
 but to the Samsung Blu-ray player includes models BD - B 5500 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.769
 fortunately Player himself is not visually much to say first l sees 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.819
 very bad from the whole second half to playful 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.380
 and the size is synonymous say the device is 52 inches wide 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.380
 21 inches deep 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.380
 and just four inches high 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.440
 so from this position could also again the beautiful design of the device 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.390
 admire 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.250
 on the far left is where something then solo on that there is the Blue 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.280
 drawer 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.850
 right next to it 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.710
 on the top 10 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 we have the power button 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.760
 and if we then greet the dead and the blu-ray player down first 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.650
 on the right side of the display we have other symbols that you can use 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.809
 also as 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.809
 Tabs Kühn can, so to speak, serve 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.470
 on the right side of the blu-ray player the Hambacher even more 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.120
 Hidden usb interface 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.540
 behind this little flap 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.810
 and the usb interface is of course always handy if you're a madder 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.620
 usb-stick with holiday photos or so connects 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.740
 in order to be able to enjoy them even better known together with friends 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.010
 the small cover of this USB bay he could be a bit more stable 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.020
 be designed 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.399
 but also in the near future to a word of power but still quite relative 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.399
 durable and high quality impression 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.170
 to insert a Blue or DVD now is enough if it was 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.229
 Press JPY on the button and drive and meet the driver and when 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.229
 the Blue against 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.270
 Do not be surprised if the cameras or blu-ray players are available 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.440
 I just want to click the volume of the device 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.799
 this is roughly comparable to the PlayStation 3 which also no solid 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.289
 white device becomes 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.469
 I think it's a pity here, but you definitely would have something 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.469
 quietly install the drive 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.079
 after the two duels start we find ourselves thinking about how 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:24.819
 again 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.950
 and we can here, like us, for example, blu-ray or 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.319
 usb-stick video as well as photos or music on any of the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.949
 Store the data carrier 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.929
 then we can also use the Smart from the year already recognizes the core here 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.540
 Various settings can be made both on the Internet 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.519
 Settings as well as device settings 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.919
 then we have another device of the administrative academy Blue l the 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.210
 usb connection 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.259
 or the so-called Rauscher device 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.479
 yes and then we are already great effort so I said very much 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.379
 clear 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.889
 I find the tracking function of the Samsung Blue particularly successful 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.999
 Player and although I have now started their data test so that's one 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:06.850
 DVD 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.559
 probably already indiscriminately videos photos and music have done 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.639
 and on the side I can go out now urgently, and in exactly the same video 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.079
 Photos and music 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.989
 and if I decide now for example for videos 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.969
 then I warp in the following primarily all the videos displayed on the disc 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.029
 and that greatly facilitates the overview of the entire data media 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.860
 This clear order function now also exists in the other one 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.209
 Direction that means and if we look at videos or music directly here 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.390
 choose 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.319
 So it's just with videos 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.149
 then I also get back to the left side like me 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:49.099
 and this time I can choose the source Remigius here then to 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.199
 Example the data is or my samsung galaxy s2 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.679
 and this sorting feature i can only say visitors again 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:00.339
 clearly below, I particularly noticed the example 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.239
 I had already addressed it already our well-known Smartrac is 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.229
 Come back and if you look at him then find us in the same 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.739
 Mask again he already knows from Samsung 80 90 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.669
 In general, there are also roughly the same functions 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.049
 but that's a pity that I find that my blu-ray player the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.069
 Internet browser is not integrated 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.069
 I've already looked that I can not but on the Samsung EDS 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.379
 download 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.159
 that never said what was a shame because the mean other videos has seen 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.159
 then you already are 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.159
 just the internet browser has me in this smart really has a lot 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.430
 done 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.250
 Oh yes, before you forget it 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.520
 Of course, the Samsung BDP 5500 can be the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.390
 Blu-ray players in the district Radek Krestan also about the Samsung Galaxy s2 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.659
 or the taz brings remote control operated 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.510
 For this Misch had succeeded in that one if one selects below Klärwerk 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.210
 The keys are clearly displayed on a screen 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.750
 which you really need while watching DVDs or blu-rays 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.939
 Lastly, I would like to go into the researcher function that is 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.459
 So here we see videos pictures and audio files from new mobile phone 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:23.379
 can be received and played back wirelessly by the Blue Players 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.979
 Mobile is set so far Doha something started let's look at the whole 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.330
 now on the TV 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.250
 Here we get in the prayer overview that in the GTI in 9100 so that 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.680
 Samsung Galaxy s2 displayed 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.950
 and if I find the whole of the countries we will find ourselves back in the survey 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.349
 had again just where was video 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.479
 Separate photos and music 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.210
 «I just want to show photos from Oberstein example photo 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.069
 Star is more and more vineyard 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.759
 important is simply that they are loading times mediocre 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.169
 good record here is relatively short 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.169
 and the pictures are in full resolution 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:13.279
 also corresponding HD videos which I recorded with my Samsung Galaxy S2 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:17.520
 I can go beyond the simple states and will of course be in 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.769
 the full hd resolution you have taken over the 

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:23.769
 US players playing on the TV 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.219
 The bottom line is the Samsung Blu-ray player has balls for the animal alone 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.189
 the test package insert very much 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:44.909
 Although the blu-ray drive could be a little further and the internet browser the 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.520
 I have missed painfully 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.030
 but otherwise convinced the device with a super simple menu Na 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.380
 great usability 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.000
 and a very good picture quality when playing back all formats
