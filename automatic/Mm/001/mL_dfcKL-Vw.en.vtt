Adobe's<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.470> what<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.890> would<00:03:03.100> do<00:03:03.310> was<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
Adobe's so what you would do was the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.810 
Adobe's so what you would do was the
back<00:03:04.090> spot<00:03:04.480> would<00:03:04.690> really<00:03:04.959> pick<00:03:05.830> her<00:03:06.220> up<00:03:06.370> kind

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
back spot would really pick her up kind

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.240 
back spot would really pick her up kind
of<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.269> they<00:03:07.900> would<00:03:08.110> be<00:03:08.260> bending<00:03:08.739> down<00:03:08.980> but

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
of and they would be bending down but

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.660 
of and they would be bending down but
with<00:03:09.370> them<00:03:09.549> dolls<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.030> can't<00:03:10.269> do<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:11.670> so

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
with them dolls you can't do that so so

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.690 
with them dolls you can't do that so so
I'm<00:03:12.820> gonna<00:03:13.030> pretend<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.720> do<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.200> just<00:03:14.799> lift<00:03:15.190> her

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
I'm gonna pretend to do is just lift her

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.530 
I'm gonna pretend to do is just lift her
up<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.209> make<00:03:17.049> her<00:03:17.080> stand<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.519> dolls<00:03:18.730> but

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
up and make her stand of the dolls but

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.030 
up and make her stand of the dolls but
they<00:03:19.720> have<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.110> be<00:03:20.230> really<00:03:20.560> close<00:03:20.860> together

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
they have to be really close together

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.680 
they have to be really close together
like<00:03:21.370> they're<00:03:21.519> way<00:03:21.730> too<00:03:21.760> far<00:03:22.090> apart<00:03:22.150> on<00:03:22.510> this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
like they're way too far apart on this

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.699 
like they're way too far apart on this
so<00:03:23.790> Julie<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:24.970> probably<00:03:25.720> going<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.140> fall<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.560> I

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
so Julie is probably going to fall and I

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:27.750 
so Julie is probably going to fall and I
don't<00:03:26.920> want<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.430> happen

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
really happy about that because usually

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.780 
really happy about that because usually
that<00:03:34.090> does<00:03:34.269> not<00:03:34.480> happen<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.549> warning<00:03:36.549> when<00:03:36.670> you

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790

through their arms I want them to stand
up<00:03:56.920> but<00:03:57.130> this<00:03:57.730> would<00:03:57.910> be<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.030> good<00:03:58.209> position<00:03:58.510> if

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.330 
up but this would be a good position if
he<00:03:58.900> wants<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.170> do<00:03:59.260> at<00:03:59.590> most<00:03:59.799> you<00:03:59.950> would<00:04:00.040> create
