Soundwave who was in the pilot so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.790 
Soundwave who was in the pilot so
continues<00:01:59.750> shutting<00:02:00.110> your<00:02:00.230> whine<00:02:00.500> holes

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
continues shutting your whine holes

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.820 
continues shutting your whine holes
whiners<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.670> bunch<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.630> seriously<00:02:03.110> disjointed

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
whiners a bunch of seriously disjointed

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.100 
whiners a bunch of seriously disjointed
stuff<00:02:04.070> happens<00:02:04.490> then<00:02:05.180> more<00:02:05.450> crap<00:02:05.720> happens

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
stuff happens then more crap happens

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.109 
stuff happens then more crap happens
seriously<00:02:07.040> none<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.400> worth<00:02:07.580> retelling

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
seriously none of it is worth retelling

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.580 
seriously none of it is worth retelling
primarily<00:02:08.539> because<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.959> doesn't<00:02:09.229> really<00:02:09.379> make

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
primarily because it doesn't really make

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.509 
primarily because it doesn't really make
any<00:02:09.769> sense

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
any sense

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.059 
any sense
oh<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.450> singing<00:02:11.780> guys<00:02:11.959> very<00:02:12.290> clearly<00:02:12.709> speak

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
oh the singing guys very clearly speak

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.000 
oh the singing guys very clearly speak
or<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:14.209> know<00:02:14.329> sing<00:02:14.719> but<00:02:15.439> for<00:02:15.590> some<00:02:15.739> reason

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
or you know sing but for some reason

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.259 
or you know sing but for some reason
only<00:02:16.099> blaster<00:02:16.579> and<00:02:16.700> Soundwave<00:02:17.090> can

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
only blaster and Soundwave can

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.930 
only blaster and Soundwave can
understand<00:02:17.749> them<00:02:17.930> no<00:02:18.439> idea<00:02:18.829> why

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
understand them no idea why

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.700 
understand them no idea why
so<00:02:20.240> both<00:02:20.420> sides<00:02:20.720> attempt<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.290> gather<00:02:21.500> all

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
so both sides attempt to gather all

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.410 
so both sides attempt to gather all
three<00:02:21.980> parts<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.490> destructive<00:02:22.880> harmony

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
three parts of the destructive harmony

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.300 
three parts of the destructive harmony
blah<00:02:24.080> blah<00:02:24.410> blah<00:02:24.620> who<00:02:24.830> cares

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
blah blah blah who cares

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.190 
blah blah blah who cares
eventually<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.150> Decepticons<00:02:26.690> get<00:02:26.870> all<00:02:26.960> three

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
eventually the Decepticons get all three

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.990 
eventually the Decepticons get all three
parts<00:02:27.500> but<00:02:27.710> they're<00:02:27.860> defeated<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.820> that's

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
parts but they're defeated and that's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.740 
parts but they're defeated and that's
all<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.270> happens

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
all that happens

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.960 
all that happens
promise<00:02:30.440> well<00:02:30.920> at<00:02:31.070> least<00:02:31.160> Daniel<00:02:31.460> wasn't<00:02:31.790> in

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
promise well at least Daniel wasn't in

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970 
promise well at least Daniel wasn't in
this<00:02:32.090> one<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.300> guess<00:02:32.540> but<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.470> worst<00:02:33.650> part<00:02:33.830> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
this one I guess but the worst part of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.340 
this one I guess but the worst part of
all<00:02:34.100> blaster<00:02:35.060> erases<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.690> sound<00:02:35.930> by<00:02:36.110> pushing

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
all blaster erases the sound by pushing

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.800 
all blaster erases the sound by pushing
a<00:02:36.560> button<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.980> sound<00:02:37.310> waves<00:02:37.520> crotch<00:02:37.970> there's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
a button on sound waves crotch there's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.420 
a button on sound waves crotch there's
so<00:02:39.050> many<00:02:39.170> things<00:02:39.380> wrong<00:02:39.500> with<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.160> don't

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
so many things wrong with that I don't

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.640 
so many things wrong with that I don't
even<00:02:40.520> know<00:02:40.640> where<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:40.970> begin

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.709
