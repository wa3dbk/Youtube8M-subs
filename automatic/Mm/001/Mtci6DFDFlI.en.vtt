the<00:00:49.860> US<00:00:50.219> Marine<00:00:50.579> Corps<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.840> basically<00:00:52.110> with

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the US Marine Corps so basically with

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.500 
the US Marine Corps so basically with
our<00:00:52.590> I'll<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.030> track<00:00:54.270> incoming

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
our I'll see more we can track incoming

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
our I'll see more we can track incoming
rounds<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.230> shooting<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.649> us<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:56.309> kind<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
rounds are shooting at us they kind of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.970 
rounds are shooting at us they kind of
locate<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> enemy<00:00:57.140> for<00:00:58.140> observers<00:00:58.559> can't<00:00:58.770> see

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
locate the enemy for observers can't see

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
locate the enemy for observers can't see
they<00:00:59.640> call<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> radar<00:01:00.210> guys<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.899> can

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
they call the radar guys because we can

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
they call the radar guys because we can
see<00:01:01.230> no<00:01:01.350> matter<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.100> rain<00:01:02.340> snow

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
see no matter you know if it's rain snow

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
see no matter you know if it's rain snow
fog<00:01:03.660> anything<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.710> can

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
fog anything like that so we can

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
fog anything like that so we can
basically<00:01:05.040> track<00:01:05.400> through<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.090> all

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
basically track through it so we get all

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
basically track through it so we get all
the<00:01:06.299> coordinates<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.530> send<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the coordinates and then we send that

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
the coordinates and then we send that
down<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.610> command<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.450> control<00:01:09.479> piece

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
down to the command and control piece

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.120 
down to the command and control piece
and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> gun<00:01:10.530> line<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> know

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and then the gun line kind of you know

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
and then the gun line kind of you know
shoots<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> bad<00:01:11.700> guy<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:22.729> puma<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.299> unmanned

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
shoots the bad guy a puma is a unmanned

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
shoots the bad guy a puma is a unmanned
aerial<00:01:25.259> vehicle<00:01:25.830> utilized<00:01:26.430> by<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> army

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.010 
against so he was actually able to pull
up<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> laptop<00:01:37.799> launch<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.060> an<00:01:39.210> exact<00:01:39.689> grid

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
up the laptop launch it to an exact grid

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.679 
up the laptop launch it to an exact grid
coordinates<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.610> show<00:01:41.970> him<00:01:42.270> something

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to map out where he wanted to place

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
to map out where he wanted to place
every<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.860> his<00:01:50.070> guys<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.030> the

eight weeks in advance so us coming to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.920 
eight weeks in advance so us coming to
New<00:01:58.200> Zealand<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.950> allowed<00:01:59.310> us<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.759> hone<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.810> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
New Zealand it allowed us to hone in on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.859 
New Zealand it allowed us to hone in on
our<00:02:01.110> skills<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> UAV<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.479> got

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
our skills with the UAV and we have got

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
our skills with the UAV and we have got
more<00:02:04.140> flight<00:02:04.469> time<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> past<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.880> weeks

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
more flight time in the past two weeks

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.600 
more flight time in the past two weeks
than<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.810> got<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> past<00:02:07.710> six<00:02:08.129> months

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
than I have got in the past six months

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.029 
than I have got in the past six months
