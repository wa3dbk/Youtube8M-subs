00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello and nice that again 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.309
 has switched to another 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.290
 small hands-on by mobile review de 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.859
 and if something else, namely one 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.010
 gram mol ti of zte chinese 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 Manufacturer of quite often 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.500
 Order production for other provider 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 has made and this model 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.939
 you get among others also at e 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.320
 plus or base and you see 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.250
 it may already be a huge one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.040
 carton 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 the thing is not a little smartphone we 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.219
 open the whole time more the dekkers 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 put aside then we'll see 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 this is not a 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.140
 cheap smartphone but a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.149
 so-called giant tablet and the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.219
 look in the packaging brings us to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 researchers still various other particles 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.850
 that means if I'm here now 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.710
 The uncle needs a soup plastic trail 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.329
 not a nice one in any case 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.070
 printed manual and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.840
 surprisingly also in German 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.170
 I personally find that very much available 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.879
 pleasant charge data cable is not allowed 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.930
 absence 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.549
 standard charger and a flat 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.799
 headset anyway not like for example 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.390
 sony is included in ear 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.280
 headset I think of the quality 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.009
 I'll just leave me here 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
 surprise should not be surprising for 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.640
 be the fact that the uncle 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 of course cleaned up because so 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.189
 We do not have much space when I am 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.220
 me the thing more pleasant and me then 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.930
 at the same time the HTC evo m max next to it 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 Yes, I have one again 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 HTC device to test 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 then you can see huge parts because 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.740
 I'll just show you now 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.170
 normal smartphone 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.229
 if I mean normal then I'll take it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.030
 here just the motorola razr you see 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 already 4 inch display that already 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.479
 huge difference or even that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.299
 lg optimus l 2 would be much smaller 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.670
 So you two absolute giants in front of us 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.180
 of the two giant I test today 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.329
 but only the zte in the hands-on if I am 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 of the dimensions speak 158 mm in 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.159
 the length about 83 millimeters wide for it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.290
 9 3 millimeters thin 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.130
 on the back another foil the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.080
 Not at all 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.940
 By the way , we need to see you too 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.440
 of a weight of 196 grams that is 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.930
 a lot of that you have to first 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.470
 accommodate but big display 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.710
 also means a lot of fun with videos 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.820
 Resolution of the display 1080 x 1920 pixel 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.370
 and diagonal 5.7 inches so one 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.610
 absolute huge part if I by the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.860
 dimensions times may speak 158 mm in 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.790
 the length about 83 millimeters in the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.670
 width for a 93 mm thin as I do it 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.170
 despite all 196 gram and you see 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.860
 maybe the back itself is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.140
 plastic 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.670
 that means we have glass front 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.910
 and here is also the display with 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.270
 a diagonal of 5.7 inches but only 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.890
 a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.030
 So no full hd resolution at the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.440
 camera was the manufacturer already so nice 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.570
 and wrote something on the inside 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.760
 find me only 13 megapixel camera 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.770
 but very small objective for it 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.800
 but with led that means I'm curious 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.530
 As the recording quality is right 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.330
 side have loud loudly button 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.540
 top on and off switch 35 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.010
 millimeter headset port for headphones 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.530
 right side two bays namely 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.780
 once here for sim cards easy 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.520
 klÃ¶ppeln only and then you can at 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.250
 put the sim card in a plug 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.230
 as well as here the bay for the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.660
 memory card for the micro is the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.430
 place on the lid itself the chambers 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.780
 Although remove then you also have access 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.459
 on the battery you can go there, however 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.320
 so do not change this page 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.870
 easy to you can do it with the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.070
 Fingers on pair crumble or how 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.140
 whatever you call it , but it does 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.070
 is totally useless here in my eyes 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.590
 any speakers and here 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.290
 the charging data cable access to the device 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.270
 Overall, the optics ago rather bieder 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.880
 I would not say quite so fancy 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.920
 or look high quality as the htc 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.510
 from max with its aluminum back 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.090
 the whole thing is the rubberized plastic 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.130
 front black but is in mine 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.840
 eyes anyway rather a workhorse resp 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.310
 multimedia machine to watch movies 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.690
 because such a small smartphone holds you 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.880
 in my eyes or ears 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.290
 at least easier than one 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.910
 that's a lot of that sometimes looks right 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.110
 funny if a little head or 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.229
 small ears or whatever 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.460
 Such a huge fan bled to ear 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.470
 hold so that but it is only once 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.270
 I think before we 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.550
 here's a little look at that 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.570
 throw operating system like his android 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.729
 you aim at that you see already that 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.229
 lock screen with its pretty 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.610
 animations that looks right 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.770
 Well, I'll just pull that off 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.750
 shut down there's animations deluxe 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.680
 also nice wallpapers widgets 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.630
 with calendars 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.100
 you can go through the whole screen here 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.900
 scroll and then you have the here too 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.070
 app-stores sometimes jerked now 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.479
 just seen but that is not 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.070
 the operating system is such a fact 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.200
 that at the first installation 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.900
 Of course first slim 17 updates 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.540
 due we will have three sensor keys 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.090
 stream and context sensitive function of the 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.120
 The device itself becomes quite fluid 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.669
 work thanks to the quad core cpu any 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.889
 a snapdragon 800 as you might think 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:18.160
 but 14 per with 1 5 gigahertz two 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.510
 gigabyte of RAM but that is 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.220
 In any case, ever 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.600
 announcement from therefore I assume that 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.100
 The device also in the benchmarks 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.530
 or in real life 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.200
 it will be fast enough for current games 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.360
 to be able to gamble the device itself 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.639
 according to the press department about 400 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.380
 euro costs the street price you will experience 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.330
 the best on the internet 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.910
 By the way, on my website 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.590
 - reviews the pictures on the top left 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.060
 to the device if you want you can 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.220
 subscribe to my youtube channel clicks 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.960
 just down here on the left if I did 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.030
 The small dealer liked an unboxing 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.490
 has thumbs up does not hurt and 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.200
 In any case, bring me on 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.530
 until then I say as always until the 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.530
 days
