00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.100
 five favorites for me in this summer and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.640
 I 'm going to teach you enamels 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.710
 that I like a lot because of the color so 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.809
 that represent for me the summer that is 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.660
 of a lot of joy and good I will start 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.839
 with this color that is this enamel of 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.980
 sally hansen is the complete hall 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:45.980
 manicure is this here is the number 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.829
 520 or schering plough divine simple 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.289
 divine and it is this pink color that is a 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.230
 pink as well as coming on but 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.230
 it does not get to be a neon it 's a pink if 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.319
 they see it as well powerful strong as for 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.870
 Summer is a color that I like a lot 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.860
 the truth that I saw it on the shelf and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 I took it to touch because I liked 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.420
 I quite said this this thinks it for 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 the summer and this I really buy it 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.370
 I bought it this winter but 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 thinking about using it in the summer is a color 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.450
 so very nice I really like the brooch 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 of those of Sally Hansen because the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.080
 encounters that are very wide then 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.050
 I can pass this on the brush with the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.300
 enamel in one or two passes and it 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.990
 finish painting my nail in reality 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.210
 I bought this enamel from the offer what 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.130
 I bought a replay was a group of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.160
 enamels of this type were on offer 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 because it 's the expensive ones there are some of sally 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.540
 Hansen they are the most economical but 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.310
 those did not have the color that I wanted 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.310
 navarra that I saw him and I grabbed 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.430
 and another color that I'm using is 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.520
 this here that is the tone as well as that 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.490
 a violet a lila rather if it is a 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.310
 and the one and the peace of the soft good me 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.530
 love this I have enough time and 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.930
 I give it much more use than the rest of 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.090
 enamels here in Lima when the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.590
 first spring enamel 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.090
 that I use is this to this with this 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.610
 enamel I welcome you in the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.440
 spring always always use this 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.120
 when a little bit of lightning begins 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.880
 Sun I feel a little bit more cheerful more 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.200
 animated and that's the one I use is the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.230
 number 250 cold is this from revlon and I 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.420
 like it pretty is a lilac 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.640
 after teaching is of enamel I will 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.099
 pass some images of how it is that I 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.110
 is the nail polish my nails and how is the 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.780
 color of the enamel itself in the container 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.410
 and actually these glazes of arrangements 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.100
 I remember that I bought them in 3 for 2 me 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.640
 it seems that they were on offer long ago 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.190
 I think that the wong took them out I think they took them out 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.500
 also in three by two it seems to me and 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.950
 I took advantage I bought that one here that I 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.950
 I really like it 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.900
 and another color that I also love in 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.990
 this summer time is this enamel from 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.790
 the kiko brand this enamel I do not 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.950
 I bought liliana gave it to me in the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.989
 exchange that we did if they are 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.570
 interested in seeing the products of the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.600
 exchange with him and not the canal delhi 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.400
 villas I'll leave the video link in 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.760
 the information box so they can 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.270
 see it is number 284 is a color 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.760
 fuchsia is very very beautiful and it is this color 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.040
 from here that is a fuchsia is very very 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.600
 pretty I like it too for the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.300
 summer 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.690
 I even like to use it more in the 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.210
 summer but at night because I like it 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.730
 enough lends enough to look 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.950
 for a summer night and this is the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.220
 color here is also a very fuchsia 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.200
 nice is a polish that dries fast and 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:12.100
 hard enough I also liked me 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.100
 a lot is this color nothing so fuchsia 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.060
 another glaze that I like a lot is this 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.440
 of opi is actually a mint green like that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.440
 as seen in the jar 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.440
 I quite like a while I was with 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.419
 the glaze cakes that came out of 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.880
 fashion and start buying me a lot of 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.919
 pastel colored enamels and this one here 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.080
 be that I quite like what he has 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.440
 noticed in pastel color glazes 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.740
 is that it does not cover my entire nail 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.720
 actually he passed a layer two layers and 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.919
 is still noticing a little bit my girl happened 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.190
 three layers and there it is and I've noticed a lot 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.169
 than in pastel color glazes like 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.600
 that you need a little more than 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.120
 three layers is one that I do not like much 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.240
 I bought this brand ovi thinking that 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.550
 suddenly do two layers came to this 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.300
 color and you do not get to notice my nail but 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.820
 it is not equal house three layers and enough 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.610
 I do not like much that the nail is very 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.500
 thick in the layer of the glazes and 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.000
 Well it seems that is actually 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.180
 Most enamels in tone 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.180
 cake 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.850
 and then this enamel here that 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.220
 love it is an orange color like that 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.770
 comes on as for the summer I 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.990
 I really like this color I use it 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.450
 quite also especially to go to the 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.450
 beach I do not know how I feel that with the sun as 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.880
 that is going to look much better and be here 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.650
 it's opi but it does not have the name 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.380
 has the name because this I bought it 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.040
 together with 10 more enamels in a box 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.020
 as a wiki is collection and in the 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.700
 little box said the names and well I 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.700
 vote in the box and has no name but 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.590
 It is a very beautiful orange 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.120
 and this will see the color here 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.250
 that's an orange on 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.350
 really like for the summer because neither 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.020
 it's even a red with an orange dot 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.840
 it's not an orange it 's this color that I'm 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.450
 wearing right now in the nails and you know 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.520
 that at the end of each description of each 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.550
 enamel I am placing the images 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:33.230
 how the nails and the packaging are and is 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.230
 a very beautiful color I like quite 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.810
 actually these are my five enamels 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.850
 favorites that I use more in the summer 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.700
 they are two cheeses and back and forth and 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.410
 huerta I try not to buy more enamels 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.020
 because I do not want to fill my box anymore 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.090
 where I put the glazes and good those 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.800
 are my favorite glazes I hope that 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.760
 you liked it and we do it in the 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.760
