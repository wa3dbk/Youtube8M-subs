00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
 [Music] 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 the episode of this ended Icelandic and nori 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 increase in ice cream arrives on the island more 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.939
 rests of flexibility can be 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.849
 seen in the middle of the sea 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:31.219
 Maybe these are buildings that have long been 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:35.190
 long ago that existed in the land of flight 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:39.600
 is the building of pretend they are standing in the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 episode of the center 's fear is several 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.840
 comparisons and this may be perhaps 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.200
 an ancient civilization and there was already 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.460
 was dominated by the sea that comes 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.469
 He attacked all the the whole city 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.859
 practically it is this is the first theory 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.860
 in the episode Death Button is for the first time 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 time and missionary third eye the eye 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.510
 mental 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.760
 this episode also mood of the moment 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 shows a darker side of the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 that everyone expected 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.180
 besides being a great friend of death for 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.509
 of the moment also apparently 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.869
 make some encounters with other beings 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.180
 in exchange for favors in this episode 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.049
 moving stick ordered the end meat in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.299
 2011 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.509
 on the photo there to show on your screen 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.210
 now you can see the way the butler nor 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.329
 which always there in the middle that has not yet been 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.180
 explained in this video is thus the name 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.540
 because there are children who watch this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.979
 video still to speak what is also the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.979
 What do you mean? 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.110
 Let's see one takes a way to explain. 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.619
 and also that possessing so knows is kind 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.040
 with spirits something of the kind 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.489
 this is then the second theory that exists 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.520
 if you follow all the series there 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.240
 now debtor and the end we say 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.810
 advent 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.660
 the team is talking about continuing neither 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.520
 talking on old time reference 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.160
 It is in this photo that it is appearing there in the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.470
 Your end screen is wearing a cap for 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.830
 back and right using a wig 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.060
 we would make a trip back in time is 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.040
 Of course I reference April or movie with 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.460
 Who are these two little faces down the day? 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.230
 which is representing the left 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:49.160
 Finally, the law of the two is 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.110
 indirectly are how headlights are 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.320
 doing a homage so the author wanted 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.060
 to pay homage to these two 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.150
 ways we're talking about a 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.120
 good movie everyone loves who is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.490
 it accompanies several purposes also then 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.740
 this is third theory a small cut 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.010
 We can also meet a little 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.870
 more about the cannelloni in trying 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.270
 make a thorough analysis of your 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.200
 passed by some objective found in the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.060
 your room 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.830
 I see you canelinha an adult with 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.950
 child mentality 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.780
 maybe due to the fall the same took some 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.810
 past seasons 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.440
 you can stop that childish good at 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.950
 Sometimes it seems that it is the middle of whatever he 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.990
 It's not very normal so it's not like 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.330
 was explaining perhaps due to the fall 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.360
 It has taken a few seasons 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.070
 past but realizes that it has been 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.260
 champion of some companies and 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.990
 competitions of a unicycle 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 you can see and during the next 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.440
 left on a unicycle on the ground and 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.790
 right side of a small trophy around the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.910
 frame side 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.300
 How are you doing? There are some. 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.870
 floor books which are purple to 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.630
 thigh in many productions means death 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.450
 and here it is personified with the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.090
 Death of affection room light also 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.510
 if you noticed a sign on the door that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.210
 prohibits the stop input 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.990
 which reinforces the health condition 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.970
 canelinha the boy type and refuses to 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.660
 grow up 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.750
 It is in this port where you are well 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.050
 juve is talking to anyone you do not 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.930
 I may not have seen an antennae more then 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.380
 this refers to a hair that he is 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.760
 an old as a child mentality 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.660
 beauty and this is the fourth theory of time 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.050
 of adventure 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.590
 The fifth and last theory we revealed 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.880
 a session of films with their ends is 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.980
 among the dvds 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.490
 there is a series with humans with 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.770
 certainty of a period before the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.500
 war of the body - what is the war that I 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.120
 I already said my first video about the 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.480
 Theories are and this part comes is very 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.600
 strange the blood rundown of good blood do not know 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.460
 a retarded dinho trip will be around and 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.080
 we see a moment he is watching 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.730
 a small film that must be from the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.330
 previously of some things that 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.180
 happened and should be as if it were 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.520
 dvd's lost from past times 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.180
 revealed also lived that he was a 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.210
 big, lean skinny boy and also 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.690
 lived several stories then the fifth and 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.920
 last season was the fifth and 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.700
 last thesis and theory that I think 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.130
 so if you liked our channel like 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.920
 of 20 hours of adventure transform 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.650
 this games minecraft and eccentric enough 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.230
 register and then we are heading for 5 thousand 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.060
 enrolled who knows until the end of the year 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.820
 10,000 registered 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.450
 so it's already there and I already dial it 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.450
