flat I only wear them in the rain but

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
flat I only wear them in the rain but
you<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> happens<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.650> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you know that happens so one thing you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
you know that happens so one thing you
might<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.189> try<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:36.000> writing<00:01:36.509> something

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
might want to try is writing something

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.069 
might want to try is writing something
like<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.439> hiker<00:01:38.340> shoe<00:01:38.930> something<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.049> a

little<00:01:40.200> tread<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> bottom<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.820> tread<00:01:42.180> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
little tread on the bottom the tread is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
little tread on the bottom the tread is

into the snow and the water and it's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.670 
into the snow and the water and it's
going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> grab<00:01:45.780> onto<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> road<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> little<00:01:46.530> bit

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
going to grab onto the road a little bit

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.380 
going to grab onto the road a little bit
better<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.520> other<00:01:47.640> thing<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.030> conscious

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
better one other thing to be conscious

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
better one other thing to be conscious
of<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.840> board<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.200> choose<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.590> write<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
of is what board you choose to write I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
of is what board you choose to write I
know<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:50.130> everybody<00:01:50.460> has<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.939> than<00:01:51.060> one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
know not everybody has more than one

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.539 
know not everybody has more than one
board<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.930> cool<00:01:52.170> too<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
board and that's cool too if you do you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.090 
board and that's cool too if you do you
might<00:01:53.640> want<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> keep<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.329> mind<00:01:54.950> if<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
might want to keep this in mind if you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.370 
might want to keep this in mind if you
have<00:01:56.280> your<00:01:56.399> wheel<00:01:56.579> wells<00:01:56.850> cut<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:58.110> wheels

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
have your wheel wells cut out the wheels

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
have your wheel wells cut out the wheels
are<00:01:58.799> simply<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> throw<00:01:59.549> everything

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
are simply going to throw everything

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.420 
are simply going to throw everything

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the top of the board so a better option

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.859 
the top of the board so a better option
is<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> top<00:02:05.219> mount<00:02:05.549> with<00:02:06.180> some<00:02:06.450> wheel<00:02:06.659> well

a<00:02:36.200> bit<00:02:36.260> actually<00:02:36.440> oh<00:02:37.010> yeah<00:02:37.400> yeah<00:02:37.700> I've<00:02:38.270> been

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
a bit actually oh yeah yeah I've been

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.360 
a bit actually oh yeah yeah I've been
trying<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.870> kind<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.500> experiment<00:02:40.070> with<00:02:40.310> the

trying to kind of experiment with the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
wheel kind of redefine it and what I've

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.220 
wheel kind of redefine it and what I've
come<00:02:43.040> up<00:02:43.100> with<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:44.030> series<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.720> wheels<00:02:44.990> and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
come up with is a series of wheels and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.350 
come up with is a series of wheels and
today<00:02:45.440> I'm<00:02:46.370> using<00:02:46.430> these<00:02:46.760> sludge<00:02:47.000> cutters

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
today I'm using these sludge cutters

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.780 
today I'm using these sludge cutters
which<00:02:47.780> are<00:02:47.990> just<00:02:48.530> similar<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.280> what<00:02:49.430> Brian's

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
which are just similar to what Brian's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.100 
which are just similar to what Brian's
been<00:02:49.880> doing<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.630> I've<00:02:50.690> been<00:02:50.780> going<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.080> little

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
been doing but I've been going a little

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.410 
been doing but I've been going a little
bit<00:02:51.380> more<00:02:51.560> extreme<00:02:52.000> deep<00:02:53.000> groove<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
bit more extreme deep groove in the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.600 
bit more extreme deep groove in the
middle<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:54.530> not<00:02:54.800> so<00:02:55.010> deep<00:02:55.190> grooves<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.580> the

middle to not so deep grooves on the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
side and then rounded corners to enable

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.830 
side and then rounded corners to enable
that<00:02:58.010> grip<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:58.940> I'm<00:02:59.030> finding<00:02:59.300> with<00:02:59.810> a

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
that grip and what I'm finding with a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.229 
that grip and what I'm finding with a
