00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.549
 and nerds, how are you getting in? 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.340
 Good lad, people, answer me there. 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.470
 they are worthy and have raised me to join or 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.750
 at least they managed to move it 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 It is good that you know that several 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.269
 characters have already made the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.419
 made of lifting the hammer and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.599
 galley were several even but the video of 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.579
 today is about anime so let's forget 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 the comics and focus on some 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.309
 characters that probably 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 would raise a screen of the tor and before 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.899
 start let's discard any 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.539
 crossover soul animes that has a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.019
 participation of the tor or my niro as 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.000
 at risk for ex or sweat of art online 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.269
 we will also rule out any 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.670
 characters who would use their skills 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.039
 to get me together as it comes from the layer 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.170
 to honor that they could change the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.120
 because we do not know if they are 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.260
 could take away the magic of odin 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 would be on a screen 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.689
 Let's just talk about the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.880
 who would probably be worthy of such 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.159
 done and contrary to what many 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.729
 think the person does not need to have a 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.850
 100% pure heart it just needs to be 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.350
 worthy and stopping with the curling go 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 to our list 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.750
 Let's start with the pirate 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.450
 Anp luf luf if you are 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 That's it, folks, it's a pirate, but like 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.579
 many should know luf is not a pirate 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.740
 bad but what would make him lift the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.630
 hammer in buffy is a good person 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.820
 heart that is always willing to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.409
 help his friends he does not care 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.189
 risk their own lives to help 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.409
 who needs 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.229
 besides being innocent he is totally 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.320
 against any kind of evil or evil 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.570
 treatment and would clearly have the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.039
 lift it up 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.229
 now let's invade a universe of 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.960
 naruto to talk about a character who 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.810
 could not miss our list 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.570
 hachiro loves so jude naruto hachiro 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.799

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.229
 leaf village 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.900
 but what would make him raise the hammer 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.670
 in him was an extremely person 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.920
 kindly and with a great charisma 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.630
 It was all the villagers 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.340

 Ninja skills your wisdom and your 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.300
 huge sense of loyalty 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.250
 besides being a person who fought for the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.890

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.260
 the guy is good the people, good brother, let's go 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.360

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.360
 talk about the great protagonist 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.970
 naruto uzumaki this one would be more than 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.740
 able to lift the powerful and unite 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.890
 Naruto does not carry evil in his 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.470
 heart the fiha symbol calls naruto 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.720
 also has a great sense of justice and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.150
 Do not mind helping those who need it. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.750
 even if it risks your own 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.510
 life 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.210
 besides being a very kind person and 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.550
 always willing to do everything well 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.460
 now let's go to the character who is from 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.530
 away the most skull from our list and 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.870
 also that which has no power 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.080
 special except for your mind I am 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.320
 Speaking of death, how do you do? 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.840
 l is deserving of it, guys, why not? 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.880
 she is a person who faithfully follows the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.100
 justice also shows a huge 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.900
 concern for others and do not 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.480
 It matters to risk your own life. 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.490
 to defend what your 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.430
 intentions are the best possible and 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.220
 always correct, making it more 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.050
 able to get together 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.600
 now for the anime that made men 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.530
 become more closely connected with signs 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.810
 women 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.450
 I 'm talking about the pegasus knight. 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.570
 supper of knights of the zodiac 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.120
 We will dispense with all presentations and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.700
 because it matters because it is 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.980
 Password would be well worth it guys 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.080
 deserving of wearing the armor of stones 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.290
 but that's not all it would have been too 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.709
 worthy to wear the sacred armor of 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.540
 Sagittarius is the time hell bro 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.240
 he also has a great sense of 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.540
 justice and has a good heart it with 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.380
 sure you would be able to lift the hammer 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.940
 from thor 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.700
 Let's now go to a character 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.210
 completely kind and free from 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.300
 any kind of evil bell cream titan 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.460
 joÃ£o leader 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.220
 the motor-driver is a person 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.139
 extremely kind and pious in a certain way. 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.990
 occasion he was able to save a 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.520
 person who had just betrayed him and 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.800
 the abandoned to die 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.470
 besides being very naive dell too 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.690
 showed a characteristic that in common 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.930
 while the characters of animes 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.419
 the guy is simply not a good pervert 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.210
 this may not be a requirement for 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.800
 get together but rare things like this 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.370
 need to be cited 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.599
 he is clearly able to withdraw a 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.180
 floor cloth 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.060
 We're leaving now for dragon ball with goku. 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.289
 Rush and go, you had to go to the 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.840
 get too long 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.240
 we decided to gather these 3 in just one 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.669
 because both google and its 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.620
 two children are more than acts 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.289
 lift the hammer both by your kindness 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.240
 and a sense of justice for them 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.819
 have a heart completely 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.490
 dark we can also cite that the three 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.289
 can use the flying cloud that the person 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.469
 also needs to be deserving of 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.409
 use it and our last one worthy of 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:34.630
 get together is a good team or better 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:38.080
 the merger of two of them 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.630
 the powerful man mon the man mon was born 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.669
 after the fusion of the brother organ with a metal 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.130
 rare during the fight against 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.870
 The devil on the merger was only able to 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.349
 after several children of the world 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.210
 desire for goodness and shaham 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.250
 the holy knight comes 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.229
 Good man, I do not think I do. 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.629
 I do not even need to explain why it would 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.270
 deserving of the galley just the fact that it is 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.789
 a pure creature created from the 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.400
 already makes him perhaps the 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:10.090
 able to raise the hammer of the 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.690
 god of thunder and another list comes to 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.879
 end 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.039
 Before I finished, I wanted to 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.110
 that we are going to make a list with 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.509
 characters that certainly do not 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.659
 raise a screen make as per 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:25.389
 example who pat credits to give this 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.729
 center if you know some leave 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.340
 in the comments that we will assemble our 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.949
 list 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.290
 Do not forget to enjoy and add 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.389
 this favorite video without subscribing to 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.660
 channel and stay within our 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.350
 next videos until the next nerds of 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.350
 heart good
