headache<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.540> also<00:02:03.689> good<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
headache but it's also good as a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.280 
headache but it's also good as a
preventative<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.930> feverfew

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
preventative so if you have feverfew

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
preventative so if you have feverfew
growing<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.069> your<00:02:08.190> garden<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.879> get

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
growing in your garden and you get

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.570 
growing in your garden and you get
headaches<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.679> out<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.099> every<00:02:11.400> day

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
headaches you can go out and every day

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.760 
headaches you can go out and every day
eat<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> leaf<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:13.020> least

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
eat a leaf at least

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
eat a leaf at least
or<00:02:13.950> maybe<00:02:14.280> even<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.640> couple<00:02:14.820> throughout<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
or maybe even a couple throughout the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.260 
or maybe even a couple throughout the
day<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:16.620> how<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.830> works<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.700> see

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
day and see how that works for you see

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.090 
day and see how that works for you see
if<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> doesn't<00:02:18.870> reduce<00:02:19.020> or<00:02:19.470> eliminate<00:02:19.710> your

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
if it doesn't reduce or eliminate your

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.650 
if it doesn't reduce or eliminate your
headaches<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.620> vasodilator<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:24.120> what

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
headaches it is a vasodilator and what

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
headaches it is a vasodilator and what
that<00:02:24.840> means<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.410> opens<00:02:25.890> up<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that means is it opens up the the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.110 
that means is it opens up the the
vasculature<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.950> what<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.340> happen<00:02:29.400> is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
vasculature and so what can happen is

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.780 
vasculature and so what can happen is
that<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.720> get<00:02:30.870> vasoconstriction<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.220> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that we get vasoconstriction and it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.290 
that we get vasoconstriction and it
feels<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.720> almost<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.950> vise<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
feels really almost like a vise in the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.760 
feels really almost like a vise in the
head<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:39.060> heat<00:02:39.390> helps<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.500> know<00:02:40.590> like

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
head and so if heat helps you know like

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.110 
head and so if heat helps you know like
you<00:02:40.860> put<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> hot<00:02:41.280> towel<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.580> your<00:02:41.790> head<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
you put a hot towel on your head and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120 
you put a hot towel on your head and
that<00:02:42.210> helps<00:02:42.510> feverfew<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.470> likely<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.980> help

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that helps feverfew is likely to help

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.980 
that helps feverfew is likely to help
that<00:02:44.850> will<00:02:45.000> help<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.420> open<00:02:45.450> up<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
that will help to open up the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.230 
that will help to open up the
vasculature<00:02:46.530> help<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.520> blood<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:48.090> move

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
vasculature help that blood to move

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.930 
vasculature help that blood to move
freer<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.020> reduce<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.890> pain<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.700> also

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
freer and reduce that pain it's also

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.690 
freer and reduce that pain it's also
good<00:02:51.270> for<00:02:51.300> inflammation<00:02:52.260> which<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.860> often<00:02:53.490> be

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
wonderful flavor and property for

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.980 
wonderful flavor and property for
stimulating<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.700> digestive<00:04:09.390> response<00:04:09.750> in

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
stimulating the digestive response in

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.560 
stimulating the digestive response in
the<00:04:10.050> body<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:10.740> actually<00:04:10.950> quite

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
the body so it's actually quite

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.630 
the body so it's actually quite
important<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:13.620> if<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.250> think<00:04:14.520> about

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
important and if you think about

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.400 
important and if you think about
traditionally<00:04:15.300> like<00:04:15.480> we<00:04:15.630> would<00:04:15.750> eat<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.959> bitter

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
traditionally like we would eat a bitter

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.110 
traditionally like we would eat a bitter
salad<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.520> French<00:04:17.760> would<00:04:17.940> have<00:04:18.090> a

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
salad like the French would have a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.320 
salad like the French would have a
bitter<00:04:18.299> salad<00:04:18.750> before<00:04:19.049> dinner<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:20.549> that's

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
bitter salad before dinner and that's

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.440 
bitter salad before dinner and that's
because<00:04:21.810> bitter<00:04:22.290> stimulates<00:04:22.890> digestion<00:04:23.450> so

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
because bitter stimulates digestion so

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.030 
because bitter stimulates digestion so
feverfew<00:04:25.140> will<00:04:25.320> help<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.620> stimulate

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
feverfew will help to stimulate

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.230 
feverfew will help to stimulate
digestion

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
digestion

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.260 
digestion
in<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.539> way<00:04:28.069> but<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.280> me<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> tea<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:29.940> it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
in that way but to me a tea of it

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.870 
in that way but to me a tea of it
drinking<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.750> whole<00:04:30.870> cup<00:04:31.110> of<00:04:31.259> it<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.880> not

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
drinking a whole cup of it is not

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.600 
drinking a whole cup of it is not
pleasant<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:34.139> I<00:04:34.650> prefer<00:04:35.009> the<00:04:35.280> tincture

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
pleasant and so I prefer the tincture

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.040
