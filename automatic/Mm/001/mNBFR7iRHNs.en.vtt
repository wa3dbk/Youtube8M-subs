00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 When flexing a fire broke on the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 men from the troop junkyard 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.160
 Owner of car recycling tried 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.750
 First, even the flames with one 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.279
 combat fire extinguishers 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 however, the fire had already closed 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.030
 widely spread the immediately alarmed 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.010
 Firefighters could then get worse 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.809
 prevent and got the fire thanks to the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.170

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.539
 marcel tugs and all rifat have 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 already in the past school year in 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.530
 her term as a student spokesman one 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.500
 appropriate initiative started 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.559
 the project school without racism school 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.260
 with courage and as ali and me then am 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.609
 the beginning of our time as sv the question 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.850
 have asked what a project 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.670
 can we approach that as sv 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.380
 Outlasted so we are sustainable 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 selected this project because we 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.509
 believe that we do so and through it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.970
 our contribution to a tolerant 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.770
 Society and students with the topic 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.930
 racism is for marcel tug of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 this is important to me 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.409
 very important issue racism that open 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.110
 must be addressed as we in it 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.939
 Try this project because I believe 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.400
 that it is simply our moral 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.869
 Responsibility is that we acknowledge 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.939
 that the humans or we 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.009
 as a student not through cultural 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.990
 differences or other languages 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.630
 religion or origin sender separately 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.909
 but the possibilities are around 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.710
 to build bridges between different 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.720
 cultures for the certification of the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.969
 hermann fear gymnasium as a school 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.799
 without racism, have school with courage 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.360
 Marcel Schlepper and everyone delivers the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.040
 entire school can win 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.270
 95 the students and teachers have with 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.130
 your signature of any 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.050
 Discrimination the fight announced and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.650
 The effort was worthwhile 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.660
 The school will now be in the next 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.580
 weeks as a school without racism school 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.400
 awarded with courage 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.620
 that is the result of that 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.780
 students first to the values ​​of the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.640
 have known project and then 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.140
 have participated in a competition 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.390
 we announced on this topic 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.980
 have as a student council there 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.400
 The students did not just show that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.200
 who understand the topic and work out 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.580
 but also creative one 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.500
 Embassy in artistic form 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.640
 can implement additional 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.740
 support for the blumberger 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.190
 high school students were more prominent 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.380
 page 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.500
 for us as a student representative it is 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.870
 especially that our foreign minister 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.740
 steinmeier as godfather of this project 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.050
 want to act 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.200
 for the simple reason that he is exactly 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.970
 that lives through his profession what we here 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.950
 want to reach in a small way 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.450
 the feud between the peoples and the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.640
 friendship between the nations 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.840
 The women's federal league from the corners 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.370
 city celebrated a 32 28 success the HSG 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.930
 blomberg lip is successful in the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.090
 continuing round of women's handball 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.530
 Bundesliga started against fresh up 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 göppingen won the team of 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.209
 coach andre drove with 32 28 and made 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.520
 so another step in the direction 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.450
 of the desired seventh place in the 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.680
 final settlement 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.239
 however, the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.280
 Blombergerinnen against an uncomfortable 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.720
 Opponents stretch significantly to victory 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.390
 to bring under roof and fold 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.220
 göppingen remained until the 57 minute play 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.620
 then there should be la roux fdjeux and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.340
 Lisa Bohrmann radius for the final 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.470
 decision 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
 Lisa Bohrmann radius of after the game 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.830
 Critical words for the HSG performance 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.410
 I think we have too many 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.030
 we would have made technical mistakes 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.260
 made fewer technical mistakes 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.510
 we can win even higher 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.550
 and have just too late that day 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.379
 In addition, the blogger explains 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.840
 wingplayer that is difficult 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.580
 to motivate yourself for the relegation round 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.569
 So it's hard to become one 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.640
 actually always try to motivate 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.560
 to further motivate that we achieve 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.920
 and we just want that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.920
 fight
