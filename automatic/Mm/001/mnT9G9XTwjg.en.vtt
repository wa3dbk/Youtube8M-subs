getting<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.519> good<00:04:06.699> angle<00:04:06.879> on<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.329> so<00:04:07.479> that<00:04:07.510> you

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
getting a good angle on this so that you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.899 
getting a good angle on this so that you
can<00:04:07.750> kind<00:04:08.109> of<00:04:08.169> see<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:08.470> way<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:09.639> way<00:04:09.760> it

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
can kind of see the way it the way it

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.670 
can kind of see the way it the way it
changes<00:04:10.479> how<00:04:10.629> it<00:04:10.690> looks<00:04:11.049> depending<00:04:11.560> which

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
changes how it looks depending which

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.319 
changes how it looks depending which
angle<00:04:12.069> you're<00:04:12.190> looking<00:04:12.250> at<00:04:12.669> it<00:04:12.819> from<00:04:13.030> which<00:04:13.180> is

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
angle you're looking at it from which is

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.479 
angle you're looking at it from which is
really<00:04:13.569> nice<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:13.900> they've<00:04:14.079> got<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.290> nice<00:04:14.500> silver

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
really nice so they've got a nice silver

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.020 
really nice so they've got a nice silver
Asus<00:04:16.000> logo<00:04:16.979> recessed<00:04:17.979> into<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.340> top<00:04:18.639> here

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
Asus logo recessed into the top here

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.000 
Asus logo recessed into the top here
that<00:04:19.060> looks<00:04:19.479> really<00:04:19.810> really<00:04:19.959> sharp<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:20.829> when

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
that looks really really sharp so when

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.589 
that looks really really sharp so when
you're<00:04:21.159> using<00:04:21.370> this<00:04:21.639> thing<00:04:21.880> you'll<00:04:22.120> look<00:04:22.300> like

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
you're using this thing you'll look like

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.170 
you're using this thing you'll look like
you<00:04:23.229> can<00:04:23.409> go<00:04:23.560> faster<00:04:24.099> because<00:04:24.279> your<00:04:24.669> notebook

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
you can go faster because your notebook

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.640 
you can go faster because your notebook
is<00:04:25.389> is<00:04:25.810> lighter<00:04:26.200> weight

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
is is lighter weight

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.780 
is is lighter weight
and<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> other<00:04:26.979> guys<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.610> got<00:04:27.729> a

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
and the other guys it's got a

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.460 
and the other guys it's got a
carbon-fiber<00:04:28.479> hood<00:04:29.190> yeah<00:04:30.389> okay<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:31.870> then<00:04:32.080> why

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
carbon-fiber hood yeah okay so then why

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.749 
carbon-fiber hood yeah okay so then why
don't<00:04:32.530> we<00:04:32.680> have<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> look<00:04:33.040> at<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.310> bottom<00:04:33.639> of

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
don't we have a look at the bottom of

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.029 
don't we have a look at the bottom of
the<00:04:33.850> notebook<00:04:34.419> next<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.470> that's<00:04:35.650> where<00:04:35.889> the

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
the notebook next so that's where the

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.890 
the notebook next so that's where the
battery<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.430> gonna<00:04:36.610> plug<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.449> can<00:04:37.630> see<00:04:37.780> the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
battery is gonna plug in you can see the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.350 
battery is gonna plug in you can see the
battery<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.380> actually<00:04:38.770> quite<00:04:39.009> a<00:04:39.220> large<00:04:39.880> amount

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
battery is actually quite a large amount

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.080 
battery is actually quite a large amount
of<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.750> internal<00:04:41.320> space<00:04:41.560> of<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:42.460> network<00:04:42.880> just

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
of the internal space of a network just

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.180 
of the internal space of a network just
because<00:04:43.479> it's<00:04:43.690> all<00:04:43.840> about<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.800> long

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
because it's all about that long

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.090 
because it's all about that long
computing<00:04:45.850> experience<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.470> order<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.800> make

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
computing experience so in order to make

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.560 
computing experience so in order to make
a<00:04:48.130> little<00:04:48.400> bit<00:04:48.580> more<00:04:48.759> room<00:04:48.940> for<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.240> battery

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
a little bit more room for the battery

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.450 
a little bit more room for the battery
asus<00:04:49.930> has<00:04:49.960> put<00:04:50.729> slightly<00:04:51.729> larger<00:04:53.130> rubber<00:04:54.130> pads

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
asus has put slightly larger rubber pads

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.939 
asus has put slightly larger rubber pads
on<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.880> back<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:55.449> that<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.470> little

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
on the back of it so that it's a little

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.620 
on the back of it so that it's a little
bit<00:04:57.100> lean<00:04:57.430> towards<00:04:57.970> you<00:04:58.120> when<00:04:58.270> you're<00:04:58.419> using

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
bit lean towards you when you're using

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.110 
bit lean towards you when you're using
it<00:04:58.840> which<00:04:59.050> makes<00:04:59.380> for<00:04:59.830> typing<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.430> be<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.550> little

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
it which makes for typing to be a little

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.610 
it which makes for typing to be a little
bit<00:05:01.240> more<00:05:01.360> comfortable<00:05:01.870> as<00:05:01.990> well<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.320> that's<00:05:02.470> a

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
bit more comfortable as well so that's a

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.490 
bit more comfortable as well so that's a
really<00:05:02.800> nice<00:05:02.979> design<00:05:03.190> touch<00:05:03.610> right<00:05:04.300> there

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
really nice design touch right there

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.330 
really nice design touch right there
keyboard<00:05:05.500> itself<00:05:05.770> why<00:05:05.979> don't<00:05:06.130> you<00:05:06.190> have<00:05:06.310> a

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
keyboard itself why don't you have a

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.770 
keyboard itself why don't you have a
look<00:05:06.490> at<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.760> this<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.090> one<00:05:07.449> of<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.630> better

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
look at that this is one of the better

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.529 
look at that this is one of the better
netbook<00:05:08.500> keyboards<00:05:08.949> I<00:05:09.130> have<00:05:09.370> seen<00:05:09.699> you<00:05:10.360> can

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
netbook keyboards I have seen you can

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.270 
netbook keyboards I have seen you can
see<00:05:10.690> there's<00:05:10.900> almost<00:05:11.080> no<00:05:11.440> flex<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.979> it<00:05:12.100> when<00:05:12.250> I

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
see there's almost no flex to it when I

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.550 
see there's almost no flex to it when I
put<00:05:12.550> pressure<00:05:12.789> on<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.810> keys<00:05:14.020> actually

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
put pressure on it and the keys actually

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.980 
put pressure on it and the keys actually
depress<00:05:14.949> quite<00:05:15.669> far<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:16.510> get<00:05:16.810> good

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
depress quite far so you get good

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.930 
depress quite far so you get good
tactile<00:05:17.470> feedback<00:05:17.770> from<00:05:18.130> these<00:05:18.310> keys<00:05:18.610> I<00:05:18.789> mean

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
tactile feedback from these keys I mean

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.400 
tactile feedback from these keys I mean
one<00:05:19.419> of<00:05:19.449> the<00:05:19.570> biggest<00:05:19.840> problems<00:05:20.229> with<00:05:20.349> a

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
one of the biggest problems with a

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.779 
one of the biggest problems with a
netbook<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:20.919> that<00:05:21.070> it's<00:05:21.190> hard<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.460> tell<00:05:21.610> if

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
netbook is that it's hard to tell if

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.070 
netbook is that it's hard to tell if
you're<00:05:21.910> even<00:05:22.150> hitting<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.539> key<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.930> right

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
you're even hitting the key the right

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.710 
you're even hitting the key the right
key<00:05:23.289> sometimes<00:05:23.860> they've<00:05:24.460> also<00:05:24.669> done<00:05:25.000> nothing

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
key sometimes they've also done nothing

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.570 
key sometimes they've also done nothing
stupid<00:05:26.199> as<00:05:26.320> far<00:05:26.560> as<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.889> keyboard<00:05:27.280> layout

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
stupid as far as the keyboard layout

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.999 
stupid as far as the keyboard layout
goes<00:05:27.789> because<00:05:28.539> with<00:05:28.780> a<00:05:28.810> netbook<00:05:29.259> you<00:05:29.620> do<00:05:29.800> have

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
goes because with a netbook you do have

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.770 
goes because with a netbook you do have
some<00:05:30.220> design<00:05:30.520> limitations<00:05:31.180> so<00:05:31.360> if<00:05:31.449> you<00:05:31.570> want

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
some design limitations so if you want

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.270 
some design limitations so if you want
to<00:05:31.900> work<00:05:32.050> in<00:05:32.199> multilingual<00:05:32.620> support<00:05:32.949> or

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
to work in multilingual support or

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.129 
to work in multilingual support or
anything<00:05:33.460> like<00:05:33.669> that<00:05:33.729> you<00:05:34.449> start<00:05:34.720> having<00:05:34.930> to

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
anything like that you start having to

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.810 
anything like that you start having to
do<00:05:35.260> weird<00:05:35.530> things<00:05:35.620> like<00:05:36.039> cut<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.280> shift<00:05:36.610> key

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
do weird things like cut the shift key

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.330 
do weird things like cut the shift key
short<00:05:37.180> or<00:05:37.479> cut<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.139> backspace<00:05:38.590> key<00:05:38.860> short<00:05:39.160> but

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
short or cut the backspace key short but

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.070 
short or cut the backspace key short but
you<00:05:39.370> can<00:05:39.610> see<00:05:39.789> that<00:05:40.030> we<00:05:40.150> have<00:05:40.330> two<00:05:40.570> full-size

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
you can see that we have two full-size

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.409 
you can see that we have two full-size
shift<00:05:41.380> keys<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.919> full-sized<00:05:42.699> Enter<00:05:43.090> key<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.360> a

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
shift keys a full-sized Enter key and a

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.120 
shift keys a full-sized Enter key and a
full-size<00:05:43.780> backspace<00:05:44.260> key<00:05:44.500> that<00:05:44.650> is<00:05:44.800> so

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
full-size backspace key that is so

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.120 
full-size backspace key that is so
critical<00:05:45.490> for<00:05:46.360> this<00:05:46.599> kind<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:47.080> machine<00:05:47.409> okay

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
critical for this kind of a machine okay

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.040 
critical for this kind of a machine okay
why<00:05:48.250> don't<00:05:48.310> we<00:05:48.460> have<00:05:48.669> let<00:05:49.090> me<00:05:49.240> take<00:05:49.720> off<00:05:49.870> all

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
why don't we have let me take off all

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.320 
why don't we have let me take off all
the<00:05:50.199> plastic<00:05:50.650> key<00:05:50.770> bits<00:05:50.979> here<00:05:51.220> so<00:05:51.909> we've<00:05:52.090> got<00:05:52.120> a

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
the plastic key bits here so we've got a

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.689 
the plastic key bits here so we've got a
nice<00:05:52.570> glossy<00:05:52.990> black<00:05:53.530> bezel<00:05:54.010> around<00:05:54.370> the

nice glossy black bezel around the

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.140 
nice glossy black bezel around the

quality<00:05:58.720> screen<00:05:58.930> is<00:05:59.289> what<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.470> would<00:05:59.680> expect<00:05:59.979> to

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
quality screen is what I would expect to

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.399 
quality screen is what I would expect to
find<00:06:00.340> but<00:06:00.520> obviously<00:06:00.940> it's<00:06:01.150> not<00:06:01.300> on<00:06:01.510> yet<00:06:01.840> why

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
find but obviously it's not on yet why

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.080 
find but obviously it's not on yet why
don't<00:06:02.470> we<00:06:02.620> talk<00:06:02.770> about<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:03.190> specs<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.789> haven't

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
don't we talk about the specs I haven't

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.420 
don't we talk about the specs I haven't
even<00:06:04.300> I<00:06:04.570> haven't<00:06:05.110> even<00:06:05.289> touched<00:06:05.650> on<00:06:05.949> the<00:06:06.010> specs

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
even I haven't even touched on the specs

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.510 
even I haven't even touched on the specs
of<00:06:06.610> this<00:06:06.760> particular<00:06:07.479> netbook<00:06:08.440> at<00:06:08.740> all<00:06:09.159> at

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
of this particular netbook at all at

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.730 
of this particular netbook at all at
this<00:06:09.699> time<00:06:09.760> so<00:06:10.389> I'm<00:06:11.050> just<00:06:11.199> gonna<00:06:11.349> read<00:06:11.590> off

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
this time so I'm just gonna read off

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.399 
this time so I'm just gonna read off
here<00:06:12.010> so<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:12.520> uses<00:06:12.880> the<00:06:13.030> atom<00:06:13.389> and<00:06:13.630> 450<00:06:14.229> so

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
here so it uses the atom and 450 so

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.100 
here so it uses the atom and 450 so
that's<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.710> latest<00:06:14.860> Atom<00:06:15.280> processor<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:16.750> the

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
that's the latest Atom processor and the

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.870 
that's the latest Atom processor and the
reason<00:06:17.530> that<00:06:17.680> it's<00:06:17.860> more<00:06:18.039> power<00:06:18.250> savings<00:06:18.760> is

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
reason that it's more power savings is

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.010 
reason that it's more power savings is
actually<00:06:19.270> nothing<00:06:19.449> to<00:06:19.690> do<00:06:19.810> with<00:06:19.930> the

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
actually nothing to do with the

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.439 
actually nothing to do with the
processor<00:06:20.530> itself<00:06:20.650> I<00:06:21.099> mean<00:06:21.400> a<00:06:21.610> little<00:06:21.909> tiny

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
processor itself I mean a little tiny

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.600 
processor itself I mean a little tiny
bit<00:06:22.840> but<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.169> original<00:06:23.650> atom<00:06:23.889> was<00:06:24.039> also<00:06:24.370> very

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
bit but the original atom was also very

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.300 
bit but the original atom was also very
efficient<00:06:25.090> it<00:06:25.270> comes<00:06:25.750> down<00:06:26.020> to<00:06:26.349> the<00:06:26.770> chipset

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
efficient it comes down to the chipset

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.159 
efficient it comes down to the chipset
that<00:06:27.340> controls<00:06:27.970> the<00:06:28.150> Atom<00:06:28.419> processor<00:06:28.449> being

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
that controls the Atom processor being

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.020 
that controls the Atom processor being
much<00:06:29.650> much<00:06:30.070> more<00:06:30.340> efficient<00:06:30.820> with<00:06:30.940> this

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
much much more efficient with this

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.180 
much much more efficient with this
latest<00:06:31.270> generation<00:06:31.449> it's<00:06:32.409> got<00:06:32.590> 1<00:06:32.830> gig<00:06:32.860> of<00:06:33.130> ram

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
latest generation it's got 1 gig of ram

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.659

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
10.1 inch screen it has a web

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.929 
10.1 inch screen it has a web
and<00:06:39.179> it<00:06:39.299> comes<00:06:39.479> with<00:06:39.569> Windows<00:06:39.869> 7<00:06:40.559> starter<00:06:41.369> so

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
and it comes with Windows 7 starter so

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.759 
and it comes with Windows 7 starter so
you<00:06:42.029> can<00:06:42.209> see<00:06:42.360> the<00:06:42.479> little<00:06:42.599> Windows<00:06:43.019> 7<00:06:43.379> starter

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:43.769 
you can see the little Windows 7 starter

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.739 
you can see the little Windows 7 starter
actually<00:06:44.339> it<00:06:44.399> looks<00:06:44.549> like<00:06:44.699> a<00:06:44.729> soos<00:06:45.059> also<00:06:45.509> knows

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:45.749 
actually it looks like a soos also knows

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:47.269 
actually it looks like a soos also knows
that<00:06:45.779> this<00:06:46.079> is<00:06:46.289> one<00:06:46.409> of<00:06:46.529> the<00:06:46.649> best<00:06:46.829> keyboards

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:47.279 
that this is one of the best keyboards

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.489 
that this is one of the best keyboards
they've<00:06:47.459> produced<00:06:47.849> for<00:06:48.389> a<00:06:48.419> netbook<00:06:48.659> it<00:06:49.019> talks

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:49.499 
they've produced for a netbook it talks

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:51.319 
they've produced for a netbook it talks
about<00:06:49.619> it<00:06:49.860> right<00:06:50.039> there<00:06:50.309> ergonomic<00:06:50.879> keyboard

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:51.329 
about it right there ergonomic keyboard

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:53.929 
about it right there ergonomic keyboard
unsurpassed<00:06:52.369> comfort<00:06:53.369> and<00:06:53.519> I<00:06:53.579> think<00:06:53.789> they'd

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:53.939 
unsurpassed comfort and I think they'd

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:55.939 
unsurpassed comfort and I think they'd
really<00:06:54.269> hit<00:06:54.959> the<00:06:55.110> nail<00:06:55.139> on<00:06:55.499> the<00:06:55.529> head<00:06:55.649> with

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
really hit the nail on the head with

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:56.449 
really hit the nail on the head with
that<00:06:55.979> one

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:56.459 
that one

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.100 
that one
so<00:06:56.789> why<00:06:57.059> don't<00:06:57.119> we<00:06:57.239> have<00:06:57.389> a<00:06:57.449> look<00:06:57.689> at<00:06:57.869> all<00:06:57.989> of

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
so why don't we have a look at all of

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.809 
so why don't we have a look at all of
the<00:06:58.229> connectivity<00:06:58.799> I'm<00:06:59.099> expecting<00:06:59.579> it<00:06:59.669> to<00:06:59.789> be

00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 
the connectivity I'm expecting it to be

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:01.759 
the connectivity I'm expecting it to be
exactly<00:07:00.509> the<00:07:00.659> same<00:07:00.869> as<00:07:01.019> every<00:07:01.139> other<00:07:01.289> netbook

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:01.769 
exactly the same as every other netbook

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:03.739 
exactly the same as every other netbook
on<00:07:01.860> the<00:07:02.009> market<00:07:02.369> so<00:07:02.789> first<00:07:03.089> we<00:07:03.239> have<00:07:03.360> Gigabit

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:03.749 
on the market so first we have Gigabit

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:06.439 
on the market so first we have Gigabit
Ethernet<00:07:03.839> two<00:07:04.649> USB<00:07:05.099> ports<00:07:05.489> microphone

Ethernet two USB ports microphone

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.129 
Ethernet two USB ports microphone
headphones<00:07:07.019> and<00:07:07.259> a<00:07:07.709> SD<00:07:08.579> card<00:07:08.610> reader<00:07:09.299> then

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 
headphones and a SD card reader then

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.679 
headphones and a SD card reader then
around<00:07:10.379> the<00:07:10.589> front<00:07:10.860> we<00:07:10.979> have<00:07:11.009> nothing<00:07:11.789> except

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:12.689 
around the front we have nothing except

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.829 
around the front we have nothing except
some<00:07:12.989> air<00:07:13.889> flow<00:07:14.129> events<00:07:14.549> around<00:07:15.539> the<00:07:15.689> other

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:15.839 
some air flow events around the other

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:18.469 
some air flow events around the other
side<00:07:15.959> we<00:07:16.409> will<00:07:16.529> find<00:07:16.829> yes<00:07:17.369> exactly<00:07:17.699> what<00:07:18.269> I<00:07:18.299> was

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
side we will find yes exactly what I was

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.139 
side we will find yes exactly what I was
expecting<00:07:18.599> one<00:07:19.259> more<00:07:19.439> USB<00:07:19.889> port<00:07:20.159> Kensington

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.679 
expecting one more USB port Kensington
lock<00:07:21.329> VGA<00:07:22.199> out<00:07:22.499> and<00:07:22.829> then<00:07:23.279> power<00:07:23.610> in<00:07:24.149> we've

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:24.689 
lock VGA out and then power in we've
