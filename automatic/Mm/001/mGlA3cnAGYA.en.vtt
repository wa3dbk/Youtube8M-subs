my<00:02:25.660> way<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.960> there<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:27.360> there's<00:02:28.360> only<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:28.600> way

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
my way in there and there's only one way

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.860 
my way in there and there's only one way
for<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.170> go<00:02:29.320> in<00:02:30.270> push<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.390> down<00:02:31.540> until<00:02:31.630> you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
for it to go in push it down until you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.130 
for it to go in push it down until you
think<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.770> then<00:02:33.460> push<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.270> in<00:02:34.420> push<00:02:35.020> it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
think that is it then push it in push it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
think that is it then push it in push it
down<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> small<00:02:36.760> snap<00:02:37.090> again<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.980> should

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
down here a small snap again that should

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.720 
down here a small snap again that should
take<00:02:39.340> care<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.930> will<00:02:40.930> put<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.730> envelope

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
feeder cover back in that not for the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.890 
feeder cover back in that not for the
tray<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.020> pick<00:02:50.350> up<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.650> step<00:02:50.950> rollers<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:52.690> is

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
tray to pick up and step rollers this is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.980 
tray to pick up and step rollers this is
what<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> tray<00:02:53.620> like<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.490> said<00:02:54.700> open<00:02:55.690> up<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
what a tray like I said open up that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.970 
what a tray like I said open up that
take<00:02:56.920> paper<00:02:57.280> guide<00:02:57.550> there<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:59.200> roller<00:02:59.680> goes

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
take paper guide there the roller goes

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.570 
take paper guide there the roller goes
in<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.120> tab<00:03:01.420> facing<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.110> lap<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:03.520> you

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
in with the tab facing to the lap so you

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.030

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
want to just put that in and kind of

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.820 
want to just put that in and kind of
spin<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.660> until<00:03:07.660> knock<00:03:08.080> yes<00:03:09.570> how's<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:10.830> for

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
spin it until knock yes how's that for

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.960 
spin it until knock yes how's that for
the<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.920> separation<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.040> feed<00:03:15.700> roller

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
the for the separation and feed roller

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.180 
the for the separation and feed roller
you<00:03:16.780> want<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.019> kind<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.230> just<00:03:17.470> been<00:03:17.980> down<00:03:18.160> a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
you want to kind of just been down a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.120 
you want to kind of just been down a
little<00:03:18.400> bit<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.269> can<00:03:19.420> see<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.720> underside

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
little bit so you can see the underside

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.850 
little bit so you can see the underside
the<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.690> rollers<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.140> guess<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.709> said

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
the the rollers I guess like I said

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.440 
the the rollers I guess like I said
before<00:03:24.220> they<00:03:24.370> have<00:03:24.400> their<00:03:24.760> little<00:03:25.000> small<00:03:25.180> tabs

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
before they have their little small tabs

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.479 
before they have their little small tabs
and<00:03:25.690> they<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:25.959> only<00:03:26.110> go<00:03:26.290> in<00:03:26.320> one<00:03:26.440> way<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:27.400> you

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
and they can only go in one way if you

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.390 
and they can only go in one way if you
put<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.730> in<00:03:27.820> back<00:03:28.000> we're<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:28.450> not<00:03:28.660> gonna<00:03:28.810> fit

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
put it in back we're just not gonna fit

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.150 
put it in back we're just not gonna fit
so<00:03:30.540> put<00:03:31.540> them<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:31.959> with<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.470> tabs<00:03:32.709> facing

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
so put them in with with the tabs facing

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
so put them in with with the tabs facing
to<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.310> left<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:37.180> rollers<00:03:37.480> go<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:39.180> each

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
to the left and the rollers go in each

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.090 
to the left and the rollers go in each
other<00:03:40.390> snap<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.840> like<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.170> same<00:03:41.860> thing<00:03:42.010> with

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
other snap it like that same thing with

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.330 
other snap it like that same thing with
the<00:03:42.190> bag<00:03:42.340> one<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:44.170> gear<00:03:44.440> facing<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.040> right

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.229 

so<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:49.450> these<00:03:49.570> two<00:03:49.630> particular<00:03:49.989> rollers<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
so for these two particular rollers the

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.800 
so for these two particular rollers the
roller<00:03:52.450> with<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.930> gear<00:03:53.320> goes<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.580> back

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
roller with the gear goes in the back

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.840 
roller with the gear goes in the back
and<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.049> roller<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.680> does<00:03:57.250> not<00:03:57.430> have<00:03:57.700> it

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
and the roller that does not have it

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.229 
and the roller that does not have it
here<00:03:57.930> goes<00:03:58.930> in<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.200> front

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
here goes in the front

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.650
