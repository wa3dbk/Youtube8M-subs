00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.450
 all-seeing eye 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.710
 Well, do something you cut me a 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.470
 here is no you 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:30.140
 distance not keeping his vanish 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:33.610
 there is a witness, that is, you think not 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.100
 blame takes nothing 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 and where is the moment of impact, but where are mine 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 wrecks 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.700
 there is a DVR recording and your 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.090
 deeds on the road 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.290
 can be used against you, even 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.190
 if you are a pedestrian this house is no longer up like a 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.860
 what are you going hit by your registrar machine 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.770
 I did not have time to start recording for some seconds 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.430
 made you a culprit before 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.980
 buy 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 check on here and the lab we took 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.390
 three Taiwanese video recorder for 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.200
 four thousand seven hundred fifty rubles 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.320
 Korean for six and a half thousand and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.540
 Russian 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.340
 for seven all devices gps receivers one 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.530
 of the important parameters of the DVR 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.810
 viewing angle here is written 120 degrees 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.410
 here 90 we are interested 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 horizontal angle insight check 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.240
 recorder set the camera to exactly the level 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.680
 equator lens should look into 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.990
 this point in the Korean viewing angle 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.270
 recorder 90 degrees as in 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.810
 Instructions in the description of Taiwanese 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.130
 apparatus 120 degrees and in fact all 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.890
 70 Russian review 100 degrees instead 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.470
 20 and that they will see on the actual road 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.539
 check keenly turned out to be Korean 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.209
 road scan and Russian aft 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.069
 Taiwanese device did not see the right 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.989
 arrows 70 degrees horizontally 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.790
 too little is not visible on which signal 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.200
 traffic lights set off the machine 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.209
 so the wider the angle the better 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.630
 optimal angle of 120 degrees 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.420
 horizontals diagonally at least a hundred 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.510
 forty five and if the driver hid with 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.760
 accident places and the car number on the record is not 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.630
 you can see the recording of the DVR should 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.310
 be as clear as day and night 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.030
 all our recorders write hd 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.100
 but Taiwanese hardly distinguishes numbers 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.310
 Russian at night sees numbers worse than 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.950
 in the daytime but in daylight numbers distinguishes 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.630
 better than their competitors 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.690
 view records directly on the monitor 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.079
 Korean registrar can not and - 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.590
 external display and carnegie vodka this 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.370
 Viennese dvr have your own 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.000
 disable 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.060
 if it interferes with the road and the recording will continue 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.670
 Conveniently recorder write video breaking 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.489
 his fragment is out of memory 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.139
 old files are erased and recorded 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.549
 new ones 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.260
 then the entry will not be saved if 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.109
 accident driver lost consciousness whether 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.730
 shocked on all our recorders have 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.230
 cottage where 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.810
 if he triggered the video automatically 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.230
 must be protected from being overwritten by 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.230
 cars 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.790
 moment of collision is shot and all 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.090
 recorders save it to erase these 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.580
 files can only be on the computer away 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.100
 not all recorders create indelible 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.160
 files if there is no such device function 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.290
 will have to save many videos manually 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.720
 recorders write video with interruptions 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.240
 between fragments up to 3 seconds and this 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.650
 tens of meters blindly and most important 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:12.250
 moment can stay for how well 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.430
 decided there is not yet clear how they winter 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.560
 survive to -20 should work but 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.560
 this instructions and help in the freezer 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.900
 after eight hours without problems 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.730
 Russian and Taiwanese are involved 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.340
 gives a Korean 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.000
 went to Rome he but now what is it 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.050
 decided 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.080
 but this number does not see and this one at all 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.640
 froze in the winter in the car will not leave and if 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.560
 steal the glass will break this one 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.550
 you can leave it look like it is outside 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.650
 on the rain sensor 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.810
 Here you can only buy it in salons 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.790
 or specialty stores but 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.580
 warranty year and on the registrar and on 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.910
 installation yes and our tests carmega passed 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.910
 not bad
