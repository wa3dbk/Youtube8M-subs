00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Servus everything else here in this how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 Let's look at alcohol tester 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.480
 I probably would think so 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.860
 pretty good on things from the background 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.840
 is just the one I'm back in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
 a little bit important that first 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.359
 you get to the 0 5 promille border 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.029
 where you have to say 0 5 promille and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.580
 After that effort is already in my mind 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.070
 a bit borderline maybe at night 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.080
 at 5 o'clock when the freeway frees it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.849
 Everyone has to stalk eight for a while 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 but decide yourself 0 5 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.969
 promille by normal big 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 go through the start package today lasts 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.520
 rather a bit neutral chilton 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 hour sleep says okay but those offers 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.780
 at first you about how the right thing 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 works like the whole looks and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.320
 if it is a recommendation i say i 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 think it's cool I tested it 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.280
 I think the money is also useful 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.710
 Look at a tooth first comes in the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.859
 small box in it and it did not 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 you have really many functions here in 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.229
 the small packaging in here exactly 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.030
 Batteries were inserted from small 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 Instructions do not want to read 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.380
 the thing is so big could be 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.540
 wonderful also the trouser pocket stuck 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.820
 which ones I just want to do otherwise 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.939
 author and then you turn that off 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.580
 just up there 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.619
 then it takes about 30 seconds what 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 i can share that makes 30 customers 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.150
 not say but it takes about 30 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 customer that is in these 30 seconds 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.210
 I tell you a story 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.990
 sometimes it goes faster 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.570
 only takes 20 seconds and then posts 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.579
 you just four seconds 3 for this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.310
 video i drank no glass of wine 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.970
 and not a bit or anything 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.700
 recommendation is only it should not smoke 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.189
 and use the thing and we should 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.369
 after the last consumption of one 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.259
 Drink for about 20 to 30 minutes 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.210
 I suspect that damn to do that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:08.190
 Your mouth area is sugar alcohol 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:09.780
 the signum will be as good as 54 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.760
 you can also read well at night like that 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.270
 two small LEDs inside the lights 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.730
 then you have the whole thing at night too 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.290
 three or two more okay 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 and then he just goes two 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:32.160
 seconds and blows about ten 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.870
 seconds 10 seconds purely then begins the 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.610
 view calculate and display 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 promille value from now same of course 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.970
 exciting if I had something 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.780
 because I had not drunk anything but it 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.420
 worked 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.230
 I was a disco had three cyclists 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.570
 drunk 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.610
 it was two cyclists and one beer in the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.620
 Period of three hours three and a half 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.540
 about the thumbs 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.660
 I calculated that for the promille 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.050
 right on the internet I came to 0 19 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.090
 with the device 022 displayed you can find 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.340
 had gone home long but gone 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.170
 I wanted to go into the location and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.489
 tested again at home and has there 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.860
 the part afterwards nothing more 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.380
 so probably times that one 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.209
 measurement tolerance of 0 9 promille 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.610
 We also write that to the service 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.790
 should be long if you want exactly gerÃ¤te 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.820
 then you have to pay practice 34 times 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.650
 about 100 120 euros but he question is 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.920
 then whether it makes sense then 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.260
 there are some strange reviews 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.090
 at amazon or say does not work 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.620
 maybe the measurement error maybe 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.600
 it also the fed i try it 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.220
 next time calculate that 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.200
 bit crosswise with the promille calculator 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.180
 but in the first attempt was already 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.900
 reasonably for me 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.100
 recommendation and yet I look yes say 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.620
 maybe one at a time maybe 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.900
 definitely not an author 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.340
 get in one is what it is 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.320
 There is no recommendation here to say 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.480
 You can still see if you are with one 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.640
 Glass beer after driving is really 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 it is up to you to pay the euro 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.880
 we risk everything the whole time 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.500
 I always have enough sleeping bag in it 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.660
 automatic discus goes in or 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.390
 Brain a round walk it should 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.060
 really time or pick up a taxi is coming 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.430
 also often home or on the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.280
 Bus driver after what arrives belongs 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.620
 it does not build a tip soon 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.320
 fucking day out there costs a lot 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.549
 Money and I'm really school I give 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.630
 luckily not in 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.070
 I am a little bit of a man who has alcohol 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.220
 drive something like that 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.400
 and you should also get used to it 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.540
 that's why this and I show you 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.250
 something else 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.740
 after watching the video maybe 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.510
 Do you see the glass thrown first or 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.500
 the device first but look at this 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.139
 glass attack 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.860
 that's practical 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.860
 and down
