all-new Range Rover Evoque this one

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.790 
all-new Range Rover Evoque this one
right<00:00:10.330> here<00:00:10.480> is<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.600> four-door<00:00:11.050> model<00:00:11.469> what

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800 
right here is a four-door model what

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.049 
right here is a four-door model what
we're<00:00:11.920> going<00:00:12.160> to<00:00:12.280> do<00:00:12.400> is<00:00:12.490> we're<00:00:12.610> going<00:00:12.700> to<00:00:12.760> try

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
we're going to do is we're going to try

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.570 
we're going to do is we're going to try
it<00:00:13.120> out<00:00:13.360> and<00:00:13.809> see<00:00:14.200> what<00:00:14.860> kind<00:00:14.889> of<00:00:15.100> fuel<00:00:15.340> economy

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
it out and see what kind of fuel economy

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.510 
it out and see what kind of fuel economy
it<00:00:15.820> achieves<00:00:16.180> so<00:00:17.080> let's<00:00:17.860> cycle<00:00:18.250> through<00:00:18.400> the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
it achieves so let's cycle through the

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.520 
it achieves so let's cycle through the
numbers<00:00:18.820> that<00:00:18.910> we<00:00:19.000> have<00:00:19.030> right<00:00:19.360> here<00:00:19.390> so<00:00:19.840> as

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
numbers that we have right here so as

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.050 
numbers that we have right here so as
you<00:00:20.619> can<00:00:20.680> see<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:21.430> instantaneous<00:00:21.790> fuel

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
you can see the instantaneous fuel

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.690 
you can see the instantaneous fuel
economy<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.540> in<00:00:22.630> 99.9<00:00:23.440> it's<00:00:24.220> an<00:00:24.370> artificial

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
economy is in 99.9 it's an artificial

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.780 
economy is in 99.9 it's an artificial
number<00:00:25.150> it's<00:00:25.360> not<00:00:25.570> its<00:00:26.020> actual<00:00:26.640> fuel<00:00:27.640> economy

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
number it's not its actual fuel economy

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.980 
number it's not its actual fuel economy
we<00:00:28.030> just<00:00:28.180> have<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.390> engine<00:00:28.630> running<00:00:28.660> right

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
we just have the engine running right

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.130 
we just have the engine running right
now<00:00:30.090> distance<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.240> Mt<00:00:31.660> is<00:00:32.640> approximately<00:00:34.140> 586

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
now distance to Mt is approximately 586

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.020 
now distance to Mt is approximately 586
kilometers<00:00:35.739> we're<00:00:35.890> going<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.070> get<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.789> the<00:00:36.879> end

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
kilometers we're going to get to the end

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.319 
kilometers we're going to get to the end
of<00:00:37.150> this<00:00:37.440> video<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.800> tell<00:00:39.280> you<00:00:39.430> how<00:00:39.640> well<00:00:39.940> it

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
of this video and tell you how well it

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.890 
of this video and tell you how well it
achieved<00:00:41.200> that<00:00:41.470> number<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:46.180> cars<00:00:46.420> done<00:00:46.600> six

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
achieved that number the cars done six

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.819 
achieved that number the cars done six
thousand<00:00:47.200> hundred<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.530> forty<00:00:47.739> five

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
thousand hundred and forty five

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.810 
thousand hundred and forty five
kilometers<00:00:48.400> so<00:00:48.700> far<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.500> we've<00:00:50.500> driven

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
kilometers so far and we've driven

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.430 
kilometers so far and we've driven
approximately<00:00:51.820> 0.3<00:00:52.570> kilometers<00:00:53.050> since<00:00:53.260> we

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
approximately 0.3 kilometers since we

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.410 
approximately 0.3 kilometers since we
reset<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:53.980> trip<00:00:54.160> meter<00:00:54.370> that's<00:00:54.910> why<00:00:55.120> all<00:00:55.300> the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
reset the trip meter that's why all the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.530 
reset the trip meter that's why all the
numbers<00:00:55.720> are<00:00:56.050> showing<00:00:56.649> as<00:00:57.390> nothing

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
numbers are showing as nothing

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.450 
numbers are showing as nothing
so<00:00:59.170> let's<00:00:59.530> drive<00:00:59.739> this<00:00:59.770> around<00:01:00.100> for<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.280> week

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
so let's drive this around for a week

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.120 
so let's drive this around for a week
and<00:01:00.700> see<00:01:00.760> how<00:01:01.720> well<00:01:02.020> it<00:01:02.290> does<00:01:02.470> or<00:01:02.739> let's<00:01:02.950> drive

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
and see how well it does or let's drive

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.889 
and see how well it does or let's drive
it<00:01:03.250> around<00:01:03.340> until<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.910> fuel<00:01:04.210> tank<00:01:04.449> goes<00:01:04.659> empty

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
it around until the fuel tank goes empty

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.850 
it around until the fuel tank goes empty
or<00:01:05.140> rather<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:06.159> stay<00:01:06.369> tuned<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.560> we've<00:01:08.710> been

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
or rather so stay tuned so we've been

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.380 
or rather so stay tuned so we've been
driving<00:01:09.220> around<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.490> VOC<00:01:09.760> for<00:01:09.970> about<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.180> week

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
driving around the VOC for about a week

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.700 
driving around the VOC for about a week
now<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.870> we're<00:01:11.049> just<00:01:11.170> going<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.409> see<00:01:11.590> what

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
now and we're just going to see what

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.280 
now and we're just going to see what
kind<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.920> fuel<00:01:12.159> numbers<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.640> have<00:01:12.760> achieved<00:01:13.720> so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
kind of fuel numbers we have achieved so

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.530 
kind of fuel numbers we have achieved so
far<00:01:15.870> so<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:17.020> fuel<00:01:17.260> tank<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.830> low<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
far so the fuel tank is low and that

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.930 
far so the fuel tank is low and that
means<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:20.080> our<00:01:20.229> gas<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.680> almost<00:01:20.920> over<00:01:21.280> as<00:01:21.790> you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
means that our gas is almost over as you

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.620 
means that our gas is almost over as you
can<00:01:22.030> see<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.240> white<00:01:22.450> bar<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.729> around

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
can see the white bar is just around

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.280 
can see the white bar is just around
where<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.140> redline<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.930> bottom<00:01:29.200> of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
where the redline is at the bottom of

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.899 
where the redline is at the bottom of
the<00:01:29.530> fuel<00:01:30.040> gauge<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:31.030> let's<00:01:31.510> see<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:33.700> we<00:01:33.880> have

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
the fuel gauge so let's see what we have

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.380 
the fuel gauge so let's see what we have
so<00:01:34.479> as<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.439> can<00:01:35.530> see<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:36.250> have<00:01:36.460> driven

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.429 

approximately<00:01:44.430> 419<00:01:45.430> kilometers<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.290> our

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
approximately 419 kilometers so our

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.859 
approximately 419 kilometers so our
journey<00:01:47.710> has<00:01:48.100> basically<00:01:48.400> been<00:01:49.390> for<00:01:49.659> 19

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
journey has basically been for 19

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:58.620 
journey has basically been for 19
kilometers<00:01:50.590> plus<00:01:51.130> now<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.990> have

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.410 

right<00:01:59.630> now<00:01:59.780> we<00:01:59.840> have<00:02:00.820> started<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:01.970> stopped<00:02:02.240> it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
right now we have started and stopped it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.380 
right now we have started and stopped it
again<00:02:05.380> 85<00:02:06.380> kilometers<00:02:06.950> left<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:07.850> we<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.090> four

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
again 85 kilometers left so we have four

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.540 
again 85 kilometers left so we have four
we've<00:02:08.810> driven<00:02:09.020> for<00:02:09.260> 19<00:02:09.650> and<00:02:09.680> we<00:02:10.010> have<00:02:10.130> 85

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
we've driven for 19 and we have 85

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.240 
we've driven for 19 and we have 85
kilometers<00:02:11.120> left<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.170> means<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:13.100> we

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
kilometers left so that means that we

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.400 
kilometers left so that means that we
will<00:02:13.850> approximately<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:16.900> around<00:02:20.410> 504

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
will approximately have around 504

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.270 
will approximately have around 504
kilometers<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.260> actual<00:02:24.560> fuel<00:02:24.980> range

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
kilometers that is the actual fuel range

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.880 
kilometers that is the actual fuel range
if<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.300> take<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:26.660> I've<00:02:26.750> driven<00:02:26.900> plus<00:02:27.230> what<00:02:27.860> I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
if I take what I've driven plus what I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.430 
if I take what I've driven plus what I
have<00:02:28.130> left<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.180> if<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.600> remember<00:02:29.930> originally

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
have left so if you remember originally

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.160 
have left so if you remember originally
I<00:02:30.470> think<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:31.040> number<00:02:31.310> was<00:02:33.310> 586<00:02:34.310> or<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.960> that

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
I think the number was 586 or so so that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.920 
I think the number was 586 or so so that
leaves<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.650> discrepancy<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:38.500> 82<00:02:39.500> km/h<00:02:43.930> now

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
leaves a discrepancy of 82 km/h now

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.800 
leaves a discrepancy of 82 km/h now
considering<00:02:45.850> how<00:02:47.410> considering<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.010> a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
considering how considering that it is a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.690 
considering how considering that it is a
4-cylinder<00:02:50.810> turbo<00:02:51.620> engine<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.460> you<00:02:52.580> know

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
4-cylinder turbo engine and you know

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.650 
4-cylinder turbo engine and you know
they're<00:02:52.850> always<00:02:53.000> going<00:02:53.210> to<00:02:53.270> be<00:02:53.330> discrepancies

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
they're always going to be discrepancies

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.080 
they're always going to be discrepancies
based<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.680> know<00:02:54.740> various<00:02:55.580> factors<00:02:56.060> such

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
based on you know various factors such

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.300 
based on you know various factors such
as<00:02:56.240> how<00:02:56.600> often<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.230> turbo<00:02:57.530> kicks<00:02:57.710> in<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
as how often the turbo kicks in the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.010 
as how often the turbo kicks in the
turbo<00:02:58.700> lag<00:02:58.730> etc<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.020> they'll

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
turbo lag etc you know and and they'll

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.630 
turbo lag etc you know and and they'll
kind<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.350> force<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.740> put<00:03:03.920> into<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.280> actual

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
kind of force you put into the actual

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.449 
kind of force you put into the actual
driving<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.240> I've<00:03:06.080> been<00:03:06.380> driving<00:03:06.740> it<00:03:06.860> pretty

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
driving and I've been driving it pretty

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.290 
driving and I've been driving it pretty
hard<00:03:07.900> meaning<00:03:08.930> I've<00:03:09.170> been<00:03:09.440> accelerating<00:03:10.400> you

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
hard meaning I've been accelerating you

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.210 
hard meaning I've been accelerating you
know<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.690> test<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.380> acceleration<00:03:13.040> and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
know just to test the acceleration and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.040 
know just to test the acceleration and
stuff<00:03:13.400> like<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.670> I've<00:03:13.820> been<00:03:13.989> testing<00:03:14.989> it

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
stuff like that I've been testing it

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.760 
stuff like that I've been testing it
quite<00:03:15.290> hard<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:16.870> based<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:18.050> all<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.530> think

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
quite hard and based on all that I think

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.550 
quite hard and based on all that I think
an<00:03:19.340> eighty<00:03:19.760> two<00:03:20.030> discrepancy<00:03:20.840> isn't<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.320> bad

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
an eighty two discrepancy isn't that bad

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.250 
an eighty two discrepancy isn't that bad
I've<00:03:21.920> driven<00:03:22.640> cars<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.300> have<00:03:23.510> six

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
I've driven cars that have six

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.620 
I've driven cars that have six
significantly<00:03:24.950> higher<00:03:25.190> discrepancies<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.300> I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
significantly higher discrepancies so I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.370 
significantly higher discrepancies so I
just<00:03:27.410> wanted<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.709> give<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.920> an<00:03:28.040> idea<00:03:28.160> of<00:03:29.380> what

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
just wanted to give you an idea of what

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.430 
just wanted to give you an idea of what
you<00:03:30.470> can<00:03:30.590> expect<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:31.160> achieve<00:03:31.510> when<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.810> when

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
you can expect to achieve when you when

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.830 
you can expect to achieve when you when
you<00:03:33.670> actually<00:03:34.670> buy<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.209> car<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.750> that's

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
you actually buy the car and that's

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.710 
you actually buy the car and that's
around<00:03:37.120> around<00:03:38.830> five<00:03:39.880> just<00:03:40.880> -<00:03:41.000> just<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.480> bit<00:03:41.600> of

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
around around five just - just a bit of

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.600 
around around five just - just a bit of
above<00:03:42.459> 500<00:03:43.959> kilometres<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.860> would<00:03:45.950> be<00:03:46.040> 85

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
above 500 kilometres so that would be 85

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.520 
above 500 kilometres so that would be 85
plus<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.959> know<00:03:48.080> for<00:03:48.350> 19<00:03:50.080> another<00:03:51.080> thing<00:03:51.410> we're

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
plus you know for 19 another thing we're

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.199 
plus you know for 19 another thing we're
going<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.800> do<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.070> we're<00:03:52.250> going<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.550> take<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.150> to

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
going to do is we're going to take it to

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.910 
going to do is we're going to take it to
the<00:03:53.300> pump<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.690> see<00:03:53.810> how<00:03:53.959> much<00:03:54.110> it<00:03:54.200> costs<00:03:54.739> to

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
the pump and see how much it costs to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.410 
the pump and see how much it costs to
fill<00:03:55.760> up<00:03:55.930> based<00:03:56.930> on<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:58.190> current<00:03:58.520> fuel<00:03:59.180> prices

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
fill up based on the current fuel prices

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.300 
fill up based on the current fuel prices
and<00:03:59.810> we're<00:04:00.500> going<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.650> be<00:04:00.739> filling<00:04:01.070> premium

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
and we're going to be filling premium

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:10.089 
and we're going to be filling premium
fuel<00:04:01.760> so<00:04:02.120> keep<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.600> mind

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.429 

so<00:04:11.099> we've<00:04:11.909> just<00:04:11.939> maxed<00:04:12.540> out<00:04:12.629> fuel<00:04:12.959> tank<00:04:13.200> at

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
so we've just maxed out fuel tank at

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.969 
so we've just maxed out fuel tank at
eighty<00:04:13.950> seven<00:04:14.250> dollars<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.700> seven<00:04:15.269> cents<00:04:15.979> for

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
eighty seven dollars and seven cents for

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.689 
eighty seven dollars and seven cents for
fifty<00:04:17.250> five<00:04:17.400> liters<00:04:17.789> of<00:04:18.650> gas<00:04:19.650> at<00:04:20.009> a<00:04:20.070> cost<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:22.699> $1

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
fifty five liters of gas at a cost of $1

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.270 
fifty five liters of gas at a cost of $1
six<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.660> litre<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:28.169> that's<00:04:28.440> again<00:04:28.740> premium<00:04:29.130> fuel

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
six a litre so that's again premium fuel

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.430 
six a litre so that's again premium fuel
and<00:04:29.639> that's<00:04:30.240> how<00:04:30.360> much<00:04:30.479> it's<00:04:30.630> cost<00:04:30.870> us<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.259> do<00:04:31.410> a

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
and that's how much it's cost us to do a

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.439 
and that's how much it's cost us to do a
full<00:04:31.770> tank<00:04:32.039> on<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:35.190> beautiful<00:04:35.430> Range<00:04:36.210> Rover

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
full tank on the beautiful Range Rover

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.029 
full tank on the beautiful Range Rover
Evoque<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.289> hopefully<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.770> helps<00:04:37.979> you

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
Evoque so hopefully that helps you

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.629 
Evoque so hopefully that helps you
decide<00:04:38.840> based<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:39.990> fuel<00:04:40.289> economy<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.860> if<00:04:41.580> you

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
decide based on fuel economy and if you

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.950 
decide based on fuel economy and if you
have<00:04:41.759> any<00:04:41.849> questions<00:04:42.240> feel<00:04:42.479> free<00:04:42.509> to<00:04:42.690> post
