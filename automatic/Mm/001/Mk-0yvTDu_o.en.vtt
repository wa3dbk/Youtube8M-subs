00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.779
 what the fuck are you throwing open-mouthed? 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.779
 fucking monsters 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.660
 hello and welcome again I am ces and today 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.390
 I bring you a trick here on the master map 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.040
 flipped and good this trick would be with the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.840
 shield the first thing we would need 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.110
 It would be the shield of Linosa this corner 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.970
 look like this down and the parante up 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.400
 that does not let him place keeping the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.290
 button to put it in agreement until 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.670
 just let us place it when we 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.250
 let's put what we have to do 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.320
 will rotate the camera as we do as 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.540
 towards war just now that I was 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.399
 with abel and ccoo and minimum there you have the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.809
 name that has died and good in the 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.219
 description download your channels if 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.250
 you want to spend those that have a great 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.930
 channel the truth and good nothing like you are 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.930
 seeing in this trick the zombies 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.540
 would happen from us and it would be just 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.000
 behind 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.610
 and well the truth is that this barrier does not 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.199
 is so bad is where you see what 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.000
 it happens that the lame people if they hit you 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.520
 agreement so I do not recommend you leave 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.040
 no little important enough if 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.260
 you want to do rounds and all that 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.640
 leave no lame and well too 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.400
 tell you that I recommend that you put 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.220
 already the target although the truth like this already 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.900
 would be fine with one too but good 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.060
 this is all I hope you liked
