what type of strings they're using how

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.020 
what type of strings they're using how
those<00:00:49.379> strings<00:00:49.829> react<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.520> their<00:00:50.670> particular

those strings react to their particular

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150 
those strings react to their particular
skin<00:00:51.629> type<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.739> they're<00:00:52.949> actually

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
skin type and what they're actually

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.860 
going to be using their guitar for
that's<00:00:55.980> why<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> question<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.539> how

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that's why for me the question of how

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
that's why for me the question of how
often<00:00:58.170> should<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.829> changing<00:00:59.250> my<00:00:59.399> strings

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
often should I be changing my strings

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
often should I be changing my strings
probably<00:01:00.780> isn't<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> most<00:01:01.469> helpful<00:01:01.859> question

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
probably isn't the most helpful question

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
probably isn't the most helpful question
we<00:01:02.520> could<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.820> asking<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:03.960> helpful

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
we could be asking the more helpful

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649 
we could be asking the more helpful
question<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.129> me<00:01:05.280> has<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.150> why<00:01:06.420> we

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
question for me has to do with why we

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.300 
question for me has to do with why we
should<00:01:06.840> change<00:01:07.110> our<00:01:07.320> guitar<00:01:07.650> strings<00:01:08.040> because

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
should change our guitar strings because

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.850 
should change our guitar strings because
that<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.060> give<00:01:09.210> us<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.540> better<00:01:09.780> idea<00:01:09.900> about

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that will give us a better idea about

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
that will give us a better idea about
when<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.340> should<00:01:11.369> change<00:01:11.760> our<00:01:11.939> guitar<00:01:12.270> strings

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
when we should change our guitar strings

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.289 
when we should change our guitar strings
for<00:01:13.350> me<00:01:13.380> there<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.799> three<00:01:14.010> main<00:01:14.549> benefits<00:01:14.760> for

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
for me there are three main benefits for

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.090 
for me there are three main benefits for
new<00:01:15.420> strings<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> first<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.500> has<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
new strings and the first one has to do

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
new strings and the first one has to do
with<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.270> most<00:01:18.479> obvious<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
with the most obvious and that is the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.859 
with the most obvious and that is the
actual<00:01:19.650> tone<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> strings<00:01:20.670> where<00:01:21.540> older

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
actual tone of the strings where older

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
actual tone of the strings where older
strings<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.320> sound<00:01:22.650> duller<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> more

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
strings will sound duller and more

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.550 
strings will sound duller and more
lifeless<00:01:24.450> newest<00:01:24.810> strings<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.290> sound

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
lifeless newest strings will sound

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.770 
lifeless newest strings will sound
brighter<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.130> clearer<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.420> because

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
brighter and clearer this is because

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.899 
brighter and clearer this is because
older<00:01:28.020> strings<00:01:28.439> develop<00:01:28.920> wear<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> tear<00:01:29.640> just

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
older strings develop wear and tear just

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.140 
older strings develop wear and tear just
by<00:01:30.090> rubbing<00:01:30.420> against<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> frets<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.470> also

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
by rubbing against the frets they also

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
by rubbing against the frets they also
become<00:01:33.150> corroded<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.930> by<00:01:34.680> being<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
become corroded just by being in

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700 
become corroded just by being in
constant<00:01:35.549> contact<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.450> skin<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
constant contact with our skin and this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
constant contact with our skin and this
affects<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> strings<00:01:38.759> resonate<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
affects how the strings resonate and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.690 
affects how the strings resonate and
sustain<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.439> obviously<00:01:40.829> will<00:01:41.189> affect<00:01:41.490> how

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
sustain which obviously will affect how

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
sustain which obviously will affect how
they<00:01:41.880> sound<00:01:42.619> secondly<00:01:43.640> this<00:01:44.720> inconsistency

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
they sound secondly this inconsistency

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.139 
they sound secondly this inconsistency
that<00:01:46.259> builds<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.860> over<00:01:47.040> our<00:01:47.220> string<00:01:47.700> will

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that builds up over our string will

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.080 
that builds up over our string will
change<00:01:48.479> how<00:01:48.750> well<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.350> string<00:01:49.680> stays<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.759> tune

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
change how well the string stays in tune

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
change how well the string stays in tune
okay<00:01:51.600> newer<00:01:51.810> strings<00:01:52.170> will<00:01:52.470> generally

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
okay newer strings will generally

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
okay newer strings will generally
perform<00:01:53.970> better<00:01:54.180> when<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> comes<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.990> tuning

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
perform better when it comes to tuning

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.280 
perform better when it comes to tuning
and<00:01:55.590> intonation<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.689> lastly<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.930> wear<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and intonation and lastly this wear and

and intonation and lastly this wear and
tear<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.530> builds<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.549> over<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> string<00:02:00.240> will

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
tear that builds up over the string will

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.920 
tear that builds up over the string will
affect<00:02:01.490> how<00:02:02.490> susceptible<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.270> string<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
affect how susceptible the string is to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
affect how susceptible the string is to
break<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:04.799> why<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> little

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
break it that's why we can be a little

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.459 
break it that's why we can be a little
bit<00:02:06.149> more<00:02:06.360> confident<00:02:06.899> when<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.320> new

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
bit more confident when we have new

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.949 
bit more confident when we have new
strings<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> guitar<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.849> new<00:02:09.119> strings<00:02:09.479> will

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
strings on a guitar so new strings will

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.229 
strings on a guitar so new strings will
help<00:02:10.470> us<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.800> more<00:02:10.979> clarity<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.640> our<00:02:11.819> guitar

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
help us get more clarity in our guitar

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
getting a setup done on the guitar would

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.900 
getting a setup done on the guitar would
be<00:02:34.500> looking<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.130> with<00:02:35.310> new<00:02:35.519> strings

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
it comes to things like intonation if we

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.690 
it comes to things like intonation if we
have<00:02:46.019> an<00:02:46.200> important<00:02:46.650> performance<00:02:47.220> we'd<00:02:47.610> be

have an important performance we'd be

have an important performance we'd be
looking<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.060> go<00:02:48.209> into<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.569> with<00:02:48.780> new<00:02:48.989> strings

looking to go into that with new strings

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.490 
looking to go into that with new strings
