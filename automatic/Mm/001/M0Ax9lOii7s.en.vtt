we<00:03:34.830> could<00:03:34.980> try<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.760> that

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
we could try this this and that

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.410 
we could try this this and that
Antoine<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.160> you're<00:03:38.670> initially<00:03:39.180> you're<00:03:39.330> the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
Antoine but you're initially you're the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.600 
Antoine but you're initially you're the
director<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.410> can't<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.160> tell<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.580> how

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
director so I can't really tell you how

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
to but this is what I think this is what

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.510 
to but this is what I think this is what
would<00:03:44.310> work<00:03:44.610> well<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.380> this<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.590> why<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.100> is

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
would work well and this is why this is

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.580 
would work well and this is why this is

there's<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.070> lot<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.250> learn<00:05:11.490> from<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.820> lesson

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720

there's a lot to learn from this lesson
you<00:05:13.080> know<00:05:13.170> yeah<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:13.530> could<00:05:13.740> be<00:05:13.800> on<00:05:13.890> top<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.190> the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
you know yeah you could be on top of the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.450 
you know yeah you could be on top of the
world<00:05:14.430> but<00:05:14.900> as<00:05:15.900> easy<00:05:16.140> as<00:05:16.350> or<00:05:16.710> as<00:05:16.890> hard<00:05:17.070> as<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.430> is

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
world but as easy as or as hard as it is

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.450 
world but as easy as or as hard as it is
to<00:05:17.730> make<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:17.940> it's<00:05:18.660> that<00:05:18.930> easy<00:05:19.140> lose<00:05:19.890> it<00:05:20.040> all

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
to make it it's that easy lose it all

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.490 
to make it it's that easy lose it all
and<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.240> think<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.540> very<00:05:21.750> important<00:05:22.320> lesson

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
and I think a very important lesson

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.520 
and I think a very important lesson
there<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:22.860> no<00:05:23.490> matter<00:05:23.670> how<00:05:23.820> how<00:05:24.510> big<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.350> get

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
there is no matter how how big you get

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.590 
there is no matter how how big you get
don't<00:05:26.040> lose<00:05:26.250> yourself<00:05:26.640> don't<00:05:26.910> don't<00:05:27.270> lose<00:05:27.420> who

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
don't lose yourself don't don't lose who

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.650 
don't lose yourself don't don't lose who
you<00:05:27.750> are<00:05:28.010> so<00:05:29.010> I<00:05:29.040> think<00:05:29.220> that's<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.180> very

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
you are so I think that's a very

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.820 
you are so I think that's a very
important<00:05:31.470> lesson<00:05:32.100> in<00:05:32.400> this<00:05:32.520> movie
