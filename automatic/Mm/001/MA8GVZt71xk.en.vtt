00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
but they didn't they just sent me a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.640 
but they didn't they just sent me a
barrack<00:02:18.360> we'll<00:02:18.569> throw<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.380> part

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
barrack we'll throw this part

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.620 
barrack we'll throw this part
technically<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.820> diagram<00:02:21.239> doesn't

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
technically and the diagram doesn't

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.600 
technically and the diagram doesn't
exist<00:02:23.930> they<00:02:24.930> may<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.380> screwed<00:02:25.890> up<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.459> they

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.259 
exist they may have screwed up but they
sent<00:02:26.880> me<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.269> part<00:02:28.019> right<00:02:28.230> here<00:02:28.500> which

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
sent me this part right here which

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.030 
sent me this part right here which
literally<00:02:30.269> a<00:02:30.420> mini<00:02:30.720> version<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.890> it

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
literally a mini version of it like it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.100 
literally a mini version of it like it
looks<00:02:32.220> identical<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.950> even<00:02:34.950> threaded

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
looks identical to it and even threaded

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
looks identical to it and even threaded
literally<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.320> like<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> half-size<00:02:38.430> version

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
literally it's like a half-size version

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.569 
literally it's like a half-size version
so<00:02:39.900> maybe<00:02:40.380> that's<00:02:40.590> their<00:02:40.920> fault<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.459> gonna

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
so maybe that's their fault I'm gonna

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.280 
so maybe that's their fault I'm gonna
contact<00:02:42.120> them<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.420> ask<00:02:42.540> them<00:02:42.810> what's<00:02:43.019> up<00:02:43.140> with

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
contact them and ask them what's up with

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.370 
contact them and ask them what's up with
that<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:44.459> just<00:02:44.670> doesn't<00:02:44.970> even<00:02:45.000> work<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:46.049> this

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
that it just doesn't even work on this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.599 
that it just doesn't even work on this
list<00:02:46.920> at<00:02:47.070> all<00:02:48.109> it<00:02:49.109> kind<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.440> looked<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.739> kind

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
B or a eight at the end but this is the

B or a eight at the end but this is the
Cooper<00:04:06.980> grease<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.580> pronounced<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.390> right

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
Cooper grease if I pronounced that right

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.360 
Cooper grease if I pronounced that right
but<00:04:10.549> that's<00:04:11.549> that<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.239> these<00:04:12.690> are<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.930> shims

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
but that's that and these are the shims

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.820 
but that's that and these are the shims
that<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.519> believe<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.239> grabbed<00:04:15.840> up<00:04:16.049> McMasters

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
that I believe I grabbed up McMasters

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.580 
that I believe I grabbed up McMasters
because<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:18.120> thickness<00:04:18.510> of<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.200> much

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
because the thickness of this is much

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.250 
because the thickness of this is much

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
thicker than this guy right here just

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.320 
thicker than this guy right here just

hopefully<00:04:43.560> that<00:04:43.830> wasn't<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.820> rifle<00:04:45.150> guys

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
hopefully that wasn't the rifle guys

hopefully that wasn't the rifle guys
there<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:47.660> need<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.750> order<00:04:48.930> Kirk<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.500> crux

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
there and I need to order Kirk the crux

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.680 
there and I need to order Kirk the crux
you'll<00:04:50.040> actually<00:04:50.280> get<00:04:50.670> this<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.180> off<00:04:51.300> he's

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
you'll actually get this on and off he's

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.470 
you'll actually get this on and off he's
this<00:04:52.230> hidden<00:04:53.040> thing<00:04:53.220> here<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.730> barely<00:04:54.030> got<00:04:54.330> it

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
this hidden thing here I barely got it

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.560 
this hidden thing here I barely got it
off<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.170> still<00:04:55.500> can't<00:04:55.710> get<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:57.240> other<00:04:57.390> one

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
off and I still can't get the other one

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.470 
off and I still can't get the other one
off<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.310> gotta<00:04:59.490> figure<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.760> out<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.300> I

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
off so I gotta figure that out and I

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.670 
off so I gotta figure that out and I
probably<00:05:00.690> give<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:00.990> same<00:05:01.200> tool<00:05:01.470> if<00:05:01.560> it's

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
probably give that same tool if it's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.650 
probably give that same tool if it's
adjustable<00:05:02.100> we<00:05:02.430> put<00:05:02.730> this<00:05:02.850> back<00:05:03.150> on<00:05:03.420> with

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
adjustable we put this back on with

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.710 
adjustable we put this back on with
these<00:05:03.780> pin<00:05:04.050> holes<00:05:04.290> in<00:05:04.500> there<00:05:04.680> because

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.850 

hopefully<00:05:09.720> next<00:05:10.020> video<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.410> can<00:05:11.090> figure<00:05:12.090> out

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
hopefully next video I can figure out

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.700 
hopefully next video I can figure out
how<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:14.090> impress<00:05:15.090> these<00:05:15.270> guys<00:05:15.480> in<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.080> figure

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
how to impress these guys in and figure

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.340 
how to impress these guys in and figure
the<00:05:16.860> thicknesses<00:05:17.340> all<00:05:17.610> it<00:05:17.730> might<00:05:17.910> these<00:05:18.090> guys

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
the thicknesses all it might these guys

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.010 
the thicknesses all it might these guys
shim<00:05:19.350> accordingly<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.760> hopefully<00:05:21.480> I'll<00:05:21.690> have

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
shim accordingly and hopefully I'll have

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.810 
shim accordingly and hopefully I'll have
it<00:05:22.140> all<00:05:22.200> greased<00:05:22.440> up<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.830> then<00:05:23.040> both<00:05:23.250> back<00:05:23.550> in

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
it all greased up and then both back in

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.540 
it all greased up and then both back in
but<00:05:24.450> I<00:05:24.750> get<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.650> have<00:05:25.830> either<00:05:26.070> one<00:05:26.340> of<00:05:26.400> these

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
but I get to have either one of these

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.880 
but I get to have either one of these
guys<00:05:26.790> run<00:05:27.210> yet<00:05:27.420> except<00:05:28.080> no<00:05:28.230> tooling<00:05:28.590> for<00:05:28.620> it

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
guys run yet except no tooling for it

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.890 
guys run yet except no tooling for it
and<00:05:29.100> I<00:05:29.340> ripped<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:29.700> apart<00:05:29.820> at<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.210> ways<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.750> they
