00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.930
 good in this exercise they ask us 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.450
 calculate the delta of g for this 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.620
 reaction in the photo creatine 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.530
 becoming creatine and generating 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.350
 at tps this reaction is very important 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.599
 because this molecule is a source of 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.779
 immediate energy in the muscle 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.249
 skeletal when there's action is when 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.320
 very large efforts are made in short 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.329
 periods of time and also because 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.160
 atp it generated in the absence of oxygen that is 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.590
 anaerobe 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.680
 and also another important fact is that 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.530
 this reaction is catalyzed by the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.370
 enzyme creatine kinase that occasionally 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.629
 it is used as an indicator when there 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.489
 myocardial infarction when there is some 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.250
 tissue that is damaged then the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.980
 amount of concentration of this enzyme 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.360
 in the plasma it is finally related to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.070
 the strong myocardium 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.290
 good in this exercise are giving us 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 the following values ​​of each of 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.700
 these these molecules tell us that from 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.700
 foz or creatine we have 47 thousand and molar 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.470
 stay we have 0 2000 and mule of 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.610
 creatine we have a 1000 and 1 1000 and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.820
 mular and atp we have 26 thousand and mule 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.220
 good to calculate then the delta of 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.960
 g we need to first calculate the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.180
 constant balance in conditions 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.340
 standard exercise also tells us 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.830
 that the temperature is 25 degrees 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 centigrade and how are conditions 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.520
 cell phones then we can use the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 standard conditions then the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 equilibrium constant 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.789
 the accident is expressed way is always 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.530
 the concentration of the products in 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:45.220
 this case would be creatine 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 multiplied by atp 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.630
 and this we divide by concentration 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 of the reagents then it would be the foz or 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 creatine 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.450
 ep 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.650
 then now we simply replace 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.940
 values ​​like all have the same 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.160
 units we simply place the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.200
 numbers to do the operation 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:14.599
 mathematical between would be 26 for 1 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.660
 about 47 by 0.2 then this calculation 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:21.420
 gives us 2 76 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.940
 well now how we want is to calculate 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.280
 the delta de gea to standard conditions 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.020
 and in cellular conditions then 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.740
 we simply use the equation that 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.690
 is rt by the logarithm of the constant 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.690
 of equilibrium in standard conditions 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.409
 then the ere is 8.3 15 yours 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.409
 Molt Kelvin 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.720
 the temperature we said it was 25 degrees 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.550
 centigrade 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.370
 but how do we have to use it in 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.910
 terms of Kelvin Lake then to 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.280
 this simply you add 273 then 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.180
 this gives us 298 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.180
 298 kelvin 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.980
 by the logarithm of the value that already 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.780
 previously calculated 276 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.989
 then this operation in the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.990
 calculator gives us a value of minus one thousand 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.520
 93 jules on mole 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.110
 then we must bear in mind that the 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.130
 units of temperature degrees 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.130
 kelvin are canceled 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.460
 but generally the texts are 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.080
 they find no angels but in kilos 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.050
 then I simply followed this value 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.670
 by mail and we have to temperature 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.470
 that the delta leaves is one thousand 93 kilos 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.000
 jules on mole 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.890
 well then we can conclude 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.640
 about this value that we find here 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.640
 for delta de g 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.260
 then how are you giving us a value 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.329
 which is negative means that the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.769
 reaction as we have it here 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.769
 written at this address 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.830
 of converting creatine phosphorus into 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.420
 creatine is a spontaneous reaction or 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.819
 be that these people who are happening 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.680
 naturally in the cell that does not 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.080
 it requires extra energy so that you can 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.239
 happen if we are reading it in this 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.160
 direction from left to right that's 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.690
 very important always to whom we are 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.389
 considering the products and to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.410
 who we consider as the reactive 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.700
 because you have to realize that you are 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.650
 reactions that have double arrows 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.090
 mean that they occur so much from 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.889
 left right as right 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.990
 left then if we had 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.040
 supposed to analyze the reaction in this 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.040
 backward direction 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700
 then all these values ​​are not 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.320
 would have given this value would have been 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.570
 much smaller here I 'm not given a 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.110
 negative value accordingly all the 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.360
 reaction would be positive and it would be 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.480
 exactly the same value but with 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 positive value means that in this 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.360
 direction the reaction is not spontaneous
