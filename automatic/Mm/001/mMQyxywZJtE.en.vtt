through your t-50 over here and this

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.130 
through your t-50 over here and this
side<00:05:11.900> this<00:05:12.900> over<00:05:13.229> here<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.130> t-50<00:05:15.020> over<00:05:16.020> on

side this over here and the t-50 over on
the<00:05:16.260> other<00:05:16.289> side<00:05:16.760> so<00:05:17.760> what<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.910> did<00:05:18.000> was<00:05:18.240> take<00:05:18.330> a

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
the other side so what I did was take a

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.810 
the other side so what I did was take a
hacksaw<00:05:19.370> probably<00:05:20.370> shouldn't<00:05:20.550> have<00:05:20.610> done

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
hacksaw probably shouldn't have done

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.670 
hacksaw probably shouldn't have done
that<00:05:20.850> I'll<00:05:21.600> figure<00:05:21.810> out<00:05:21.990> if<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.200> works<00:05:22.410> or<00:05:22.560> not

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
that I'll figure out if it works or not

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.840 
that I'll figure out if it works or not
and<00:05:22.970> saw<00:05:23.970> this<00:05:24.210> piece<00:05:24.479> off<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:25.729> then<00:05:26.729> I'm

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
and saw this piece off and then I'm

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.270 
and saw this piece off and then I'm
gonna<00:05:26.940> saw<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:27.450> piece<00:05:27.720> off<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:29.070> should

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
gonna saw this piece off and it should

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.540 
gonna saw this piece off and it should
expose<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.640> hole<00:05:30.350> but<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:32.039> me<00:05:32.190> looks<00:05:32.460> like

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
expose a hole but that to me looks like

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.630 
expose a hole but that to me looks like
it's<00:05:32.820> welded<00:05:33.240> in<00:05:33.360> there<00:05:33.510> pretty<00:05:33.690> decent<00:05:34.640> and

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
it's welded in there pretty decent and

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.700 
it's welded in there pretty decent and
on<00:05:35.910> this<00:05:36.030> side<00:05:36.270> too<00:05:36.539> like<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.169> took<00:05:37.229> a<00:05:37.380> hammer

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
on this side too like I took a hammer

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.279 
on this side too like I took a hammer
and<00:05:38.180> tried<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.300> bang<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.690> out<00:05:39.900> through<00:05:40.260> the

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
and tried to bang that out through the

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.480 
and tried to bang that out through the
other<00:05:40.380> side<00:05:40.650> they<00:05:40.800> didn't<00:05:41.010> come<00:05:41.130> out<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:41.280> I'm

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
other side they didn't come out so I'm

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.770 
other side they didn't come out so I'm
not<00:05:41.550> sure<00:05:41.760> what<00:05:41.940> I'm<00:05:42.030> gonna<00:05:42.150> do<00:05:42.360> yet<00:05:42.600> but

I ordered the Box from super Krewe sound

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.559

the<00:07:27.599> lift<00:07:27.810> kit<00:07:27.930> and<00:07:28.080> the<00:07:28.199> box<00:07:28.379> together<00:07:28.620> but

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
the lift kit and the box together but

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.769 
the lift kit and the box together but
it's<00:07:29.639> just<00:07:29.699> a<00:07:29.849> box<00:07:30.029> for<00:07:30.240> 212<00:07:32.419> without<00:07:33.419> the<00:07:33.569> lift

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:33.779 
it's just a box for 212 without the lift

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:38.350 
it's just a box for 212 without the lift
kit<00:07:33.990> to<00:07:34.639> regular<00:07:35.639> size<00:07:35.819> 12<00:07:36.800> under<00:07:37.800> our<00:07:37.919> seats
