the major phone carriers sending us

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.099 
the major phone carriers sending us
phones<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> tune<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.019> can

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 
phones so you want to tune in so you can

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.380 
phones so you want to tune in so you can
see<00:00:34.289> all<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.859> greatest<00:00:35.340> latest<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.940> greatest

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
see all the greatest latest and greatest

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.759 
see all the greatest latest and greatest
and<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.960> course<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.320> break<00:00:37.530> down<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
and of course we break down the

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.799 
and of course we break down the
benchmark<00:00:38.250> suppose<00:00:38.489> everything<00:00:38.910> else<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
benchmark suppose everything else so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.869 
benchmark suppose everything else so
they<00:00:40.230> say<00:00:40.440> T's<00:00:40.679> T<00:00:40.859> for<00:00:41.129> loading<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> phone<00:00:41.640> so

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
they say T's T for loading the phone so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.669 
they say T's T for loading the phone so
it's<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.179> to<00:00:42.269> be<00:00:42.359> doing<00:00:42.539> a<00:00:42.719> geek<00:00:43.019> bench<00:00:43.289> to

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
it's going to be doing a geek bench to

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's going to be doing a geek bench to
test<00:00:44.039> here<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.120> test<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.929> see

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
test here and an and to to test to see

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
test here and an and to to test to see
which<00:00:46.559> these<00:00:46.800> devices<00:00:47.280> perform<00:00:47.640> better<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
which these devices perform better and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.299 
which these devices perform better and
they<00:00:48.480> roughly<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.170> about<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> same<00:00:49.769> sort<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
they roughly have about the same sort of

they roughly have about the same sort of
processor<00:00:51.179> in<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.510> they're<00:00:51.719> both<00:00:51.929> 1.7<00:00:52.920> 3

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the market this month there was four of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670 
them issued in May of 2013 on different
carriers<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.600> we'll<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.200> these<00:01:07.410> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
carriers and then we'll see how these to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
carriers and then we'll see how these to
perform<00:01:08.250> against<00:01:08.730> each<00:01:08.850> other<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.480> given<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
perform against each other now given the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.900 
perform against each other now given the
LG<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> much<00:01:11.010> bigger<00:01:11.190> screen<00:01:11.430> they're<00:01:11.760> both

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
LG is a much bigger screen they're both

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.410 
LG is a much bigger screen they're both
1080p<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.980> very<00:01:13.980> fast<00:01:14.250> phones<00:01:14.550> and<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.180> each

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
1080p and very fast phones and in each

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
1080p and very fast phones and in each
of<00:01:15.600> their<00:01:15.690> rights<00:01:15.870> it's<00:01:16.380> good<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.590> run<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
of their rights it's good and run the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.960 
of their rights it's good and run the
benchmarks<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.430> fun<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:19.640> we'll<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.760> through

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
benchmarks are fun and we'll go through

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.350 
benchmarks are fun and we'll go through
the<00:01:21.060> process<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.540> given<00:01:22.790> its<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.180> much<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the process now given its not so much a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.000 
the process now given its not so much a
comparison<00:01:24.900> between<00:01:24.960> these<00:01:25.320> two<00:01:25.500> phones<00:01:25.710> but

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
comparison between these two phones but

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.590 
comparison between these two phones but
if<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.430> home<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.060> download<00:01:27.270> these

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
if you're at home you can download these

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
if you're at home you can download these
apps<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.350> deep<00:01:28.920> bench<00:01:29.190> 2<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.760> antutu

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
apps the deep bench 2 and the antutu

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780 
apps the deep bench 2 and the antutu
benchmark<00:01:31.010> app<00:01:32.010> so<00:01:32.250> there's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.460> few<00:01:32.640> other

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790

benchmarking apps we use and in doing so

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.730 
benchmarking apps we use and in doing so
you<00:01:39.300> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.690> compare<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:40.230> your<00:01:40.500> phone

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you kind of compare how your phone

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
you kind of compare how your phone
matches<00:01:41.190> up<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> these<00:01:41.550> phones<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.330> determine

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
matches up to these phones or determine

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.510 
matches up to these phones or determine
which<00:01:42.960> phone<00:01:43.230> might<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
which phone might be the one you want to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.970 
which phone might be the one you want to
buy<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> future<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.230> it's<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.800> fun

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
AT&amp;T HTC One we'll see when our deep

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.680 
AT&amp;T HTC One we'll see when our deep
bench<00:04:00.040> two<00:04:00.340> scores<00:04:00.700> can<00:04:00.910> come<00:04:01.090> out<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.480> that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
bench two scores can come out and that

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.280 
bench two scores can come out and that
will<00:04:01.810> go<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.280> n2<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.610> benchmark<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.840> get<00:04:05.260> a

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
will go to the n2 to benchmark and get a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.890 
will go to the n2 to benchmark and get a
good<00:04:05.470> idea<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.799> what<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.100> is<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.540> there's

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
good idea is what it is so the there's

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.810 
good idea is what it is so the there's
lots<00:04:08.079> of<00:04:08.170> things<00:04:08.320> can<00:04:08.590> vary<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.489> scoring

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
lots of things can vary in the scoring

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.400 
lots of things can vary in the scoring
of<00:04:10.000> these<00:04:10.180> there's<00:04:10.510> stuff<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.780> goes<00:04:11.049> on<00:04:11.260> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
of these there's stuff that goes on the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.350 
of these there's stuff that goes on the
background<00:04:11.920> with<00:04:12.040> these<00:04:12.190> devices<00:04:12.579> this<00:04:13.150> is<00:04:13.299> a

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
background with these devices this is a

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.699

really low score in fact this is a

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.289 
really low score in fact this is a
horrible<00:04:15.280> score<00:04:15.610> from<00:04:15.700> we've<00:04:15.850> seen<00:04:16.090> we've

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.430 
a message
I<00:04:21.370> mean<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.850> could<00:04:22.060> be<00:04:22.210> some<00:04:22.449> bit<00:04:22.690> but<00:04:23.169> we're

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
I mean that could be some bit but we're

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.250 
I mean that could be some bit but we're
gonna<00:04:23.530> fall<00:04:24.190> back<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:25.150> secondary<00:04:25.870> score

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
gonna fall back to a secondary score

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.730 
gonna fall back to a secondary score
system<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:27.340> many<00:04:28.000> people<00:04:28.360> refer<00:04:29.199> to<00:04:29.410> and

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
system that many people refer to and

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.120 
system that many people refer to and
used<00:04:30.070> called<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.860> antutu

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
used called the antutu

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.060 
used called the antutu
system<00:04:33.699> so<00:04:33.970> let's<00:04:34.120> go<00:04:34.270> ahead<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.770> go<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.830> that

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
system so let's go ahead and go to that

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.760 
system so let's go ahead and go to that
and<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:37.090> antutu<00:04:37.419> benchmark<00:04:37.630> system<00:04:38.620> is

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
and the antutu benchmark system is

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.670 
and the antutu benchmark system is
something<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:39.250> many<00:04:39.460> people<00:04:39.520> use<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.680> follow

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
something that many people use to follow

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.830 
something that many people use to follow
up<00:04:41.889> with<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.160> scores<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.210> can<00:04:43.360> take<00:04:43.540> and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
up with the scores that you can take and

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.420 
up with the scores that you can take and
get<00:04:44.169> on<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.650> device<00:04:45.389> let's<00:04:46.389> take<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.750> look<00:04:47.110> here

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
get on the device let's take a look here

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.420 
get on the device let's take a look here
so<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.820> can<00:04:48.970> see<00:04:49.180> here<00:04:49.389> that<00:04:49.510> with<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.720> antutu

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
so you can see here that with the antutu

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.400 
so you can see here that with the antutu
software<00:04:51.430> we<00:04:52.389> came<00:04:52.630> up<00:04:52.780> with<00:04:52.900> pretty<00:04:53.139> much<00:04:53.290> the

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
software we came up with pretty much the

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.710 
software we came up with pretty much the
similar<00:04:53.770> scores<00:04:54.150> let's<00:04:55.150> go<00:04:55.210> ahead<00:04:55.270> break<00:04:55.540> down

now some of these apps are different

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.219 
now some of these apps are different
