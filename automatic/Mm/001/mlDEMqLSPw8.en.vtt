00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.770
 tutorial 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 it's about how to put on screen 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.619
 complete 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.350
 the operating system when one is in 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.080
 virtual machine this time I have 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.650
 several virtual machines 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:36.090
 I'm going to open one I'm going to open windows xp 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.090
 I am going to give initial 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.040
 go wonder 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.520
 how to install good there are several videos in 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.650
 internet how to install windows xp and how 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.080
 install virtual machines but in this 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.930
 I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.230
 put it on the screen completely as 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.680
 you can check you can lengthen and you 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.040
 it can be great 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.130
 I do not know if you can do this with you 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.730
 if this little eyelash comes out and with that 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.730
 can expand 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.619
 but it can also be done on the screen 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.619
 complete 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.579
 Well, I'm going to teach you how 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.230
 it's easy to basically install some 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.550
 drivers the drivers it brings 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.680
 the virtual machine system how 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.980
 install those drivers well we're going in 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.120
 this little eyelash we give here in this 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.760
 part of them will suddenly come out 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.270
 series of 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.760
 of parts that install and that you 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.340
 they accept and begin to download it 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.460
 to leave 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.970
 here I used to come out with a little eyelash when 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.819
 already begins to download more or less 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.000
 dilates about 20 minutes because it is 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.120
 something heavy the driver but it works 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.250
 correctly and I'm going to go in I'm going to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.920
 teaching as desired can be done 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.470
 in full screen they simply give 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.360
 here 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.340
 how can you check that is on screen 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.370
 complete and you can have all the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.940
 normal functions everything what you 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.940
 want to do 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.680
 this system works very well is good 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.900
 the solution to make full screen 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.970
 it's the only solution I found but 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.970
 it is the easiest the most optimal 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.590
 we left full screen 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.590
 we close 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.440
 how can they check I have other 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.300
 operating systems like the link or the 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.790
 android 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.670
 and that can also be done the same 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.030
 you can expand in full screen but 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.550
 to me that he wanted me I was the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.150
 of windows xp to use about 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.100
 programs that in windows 7 do not 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.500
 there are several programs that do not work 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.930
 they work only they work me in 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.650
 windows xp 2 I had to be a machine 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.340
 virtual to do is that that operation 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.290
 good would be all friends on my part and 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.030
 I hope to continue uploading more videos I hope 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.190
 that they continue to help me with seconds like 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.070
 this that subscribe to my mega page 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.450
